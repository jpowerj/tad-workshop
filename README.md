I emailed [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/N9ES0LlcANSQQaP43) out to get a peek into the minds of people who want to attend the workshop, so that I know things like where to start, what knowledge to assume, and what types of examples or text collections yall would find interesting.

Last but definitely not least, you'll be in a really good spot if you complete this [Interactive R Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) before the first workshop. But I'll still go over the topics briefly just in case.

## First Workshop: Gentle But SPEEDY Introduction to R

Full tutorial now up and ready, in [`Introduction_to_R.md`](week_1/Introduction_to_R.md) within the `week-1` folder!

Previews of potential topics for the (not-yet-written, since hopefully I'll customize extensively) second, third, and fourth workshops:

## Second Workshop: From Data Analysis to TEXT ANALYSIS

Soon to come, in [`Basic_Text_Analysis.md`](week_2/Basic_Text_Analysis.md) within the `week-2` folder.

### Data analysis redux: *Non*-linear models

glm() and the new (basically) required argument

Refresher on logit, probit, tobit

Simplest logit example
* How to get coeffs as *probabilities* instead of log-odds ratios: use `plogis(model$coefficients))`

### Text Analysis 2: Sentiment Analysis Boogaloo

## Third Workshop (Now it's all text analysis all the time)

### Text Analysis 3: topic modeling

Now intro to topic modeling. (Blei figure of NYTimes figures, then Blei figure with colored disks and science article)

Simplest possible topic model project

Simplest possible *dynamic* topic model (if I have time, otherwise next week)

Methods for measuring "Innovation" and "Influence" over time (if I have time)

## Fourth Workshop: The paths ahead

Finish dynamic topic modeling (if necessary)

WEB SCRAPING. SOCIAL MEDIA DATA. LOUD NOISES.

word2vec social science example

Text analysis *combined* with network analysis

Fun datasets! Do things with them. Go. Now.
