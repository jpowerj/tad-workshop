7701,Session 72 - 2017,AFG_72_2017.txt,AFG_72_2017,72,2017,AFG,"As I stand here before the General Assembly today, I am reminded that the wise men and women of 1945 displayed a unique capacity to learn from and act on the lessons of history. Shaped by the Great Depression and tempered by the carnage of the Second World War, they established global order through institutions that would provide security and stability for generations to come. The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other organizations were founded to coordinate responses to international challenges and to make crimes against humanity a thing of the past. There can be little doubt that today the scale, scope and speed of their imagination and efforts have not yet been matched. But future historians will judge those institutions on how they respond to the challenges of today and the challenges we must confront in the future. As global leaders, we seek certainty and familiarity in the rules of the game that dominated the twentieth century. But in todayâ??s ever-changing world, the dominant contextual characteristic defining our times is extreme uncertainty. It is easy to illustrate this uncertainty by looking at threats we are facing â?? to our economies, our security and our values. There is an emerging consensus that advanced economies have yet to arrive at proper growth models to overcome high unemployment, decreasing income and wealth inequality. The threat of economic crisis, therefore, still hangs over us. Sixteen years after the tragedy of 11 September 2001, the threat of violence by non-State actors has taken the form of a fifth wave of political violence and terrorism. Driven by transnational terrorist networks, criminal organizations, cybercrime and State sponsorship of terror, this fifth wave promises to be a decades-long threat to international security rather than a passing phenomenon. In the twentieth century, the world came together to push back the spread of fascism so that democratic freedoms could be secured. Those very freedoms are under attack today from global terrorism. Terrorism is not only an attack on human life and basic freedoms, but an attack on the compact of citizenship, an attack on the nation-Stateâ??s relationship with its people, which makes democratic societies unique, fair and free. We must confront the threat of terrorism as a united force and meet it with a long-term solution that matches the long-term agenda of the terrorists themselves. Lastly, despite the incorporation of tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the Constitutions of most countries of the world, crimes against humanity still occur with painful regularity. The ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya is especially shocking. Aung San Suu Kyiâ??s lengthy silence was tragic, as our hopes that an icon of human rights would choose principle over power were frustrated. I welcome the chance for Afghanistan to have a seat on the Human Rights Council in order to have a more central role in discussions on these important issues. As a people who are still experiencing crimes against humanity â?? the latest being killing of civilians in the Mirza Ulang village and attacks on mosques in Kabul and Herat and elsewhere â?? we are eager to add our voice in support of human rights. Overcoming the destructive and disruptive patterns of change in the twenty-first century requires collective and coordinated action at the global, local and individual levels. An effective, efficient and respected United Nations is the need of the hour; we must let our twentieth-century institutions be put to the test. I therefore congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also want to recognize and appreciate the efforts of His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson during the previous session, and I commend His Excellency Secretary-General Guterres for launching his reform of the United Nations. If the United Nations did not exist today, we would have to invent it to address the demands of our time. Delivering on the promises of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the context of uncertainty requires re-examination of core functions, re-engineering of business processes, reinvigoration of organizational culture and values, and the reform of systems of accountability. If the United Nations is to be more relevant to countries like mine, it must deliver as one United Nations. But this objective has not yet been fulfilled. The inherited model of the United Nations agencies as instruments of technical assistance and capacity-building should be subjected to the market test, namely, value-for-money and sustainability of results in comparison to Government, private sector and non-governmental modes of delivery. Mutual accountability is a proven mechanism of consolidation and expansion of partnerships and trust-building. I am honoured to stand before the General Assembly to represent and speak for the people of Afghanistan. We have borne adversity, deprivation and drought with dignity, met invasion with valour and defended our homeland with patriotic fervour. As the front-line State in the global struggle against terrorism and in the front-line of defence of democratic freedoms, our people and security forces are accomplishing heroic deeds on a daily basis. We too â?? as a nation, a State and a people â?? are reinventing ourselves to address the challenges and potential offered to us in the twenty- first century. With President Trumpâ??s recent announcement of his strategy to counter terror and stabilize South Asia, Afghanistanâ??s enduring partnership with the United States and the international community has been renewed and redirected. We welcome that strategy, which has now set us on a pathway to certainty. The Afghan people have looked to the United States for this type of resolve for years. We pay tribute to all the men and women of allied nations who have served with us, particularly those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. The strategy consolidates all instruments of American power, conveying a message that the Taliban and their backers cannot win militarily. Only through political settlement can we achieve enduring peace, and I call upon all ranks of Taliban to engage in intra-Afghan dialogue. We now also have an opportunity for a dialogue with our neighbours on how we can work together earnestly to eliminate terrorism and contain extremism. I call upon Pakistan to engage with us in a comprehensive State-to-State dialogue on peace, security and regional cooperation leading to prosperity. The Afghan Government has proven that we are committed to peace through our own internal processes, as demonstrated by the peace agreement with Hizb-international Islami. We now call on all of our neighbours, near and far, to join us through the Kabul process in our comprehensive quest for peace and regional stability. However, moving forward, we ask for a change of perspective from our international partners. For too long, the conflict in Afghanistan has been viewed through the prism of civil war; but the war is not within our soil, it is over our soil. Today there are over 20 international terrorist groups with an imposed presence on Afghan soil. The future of Afghanistan matters because we are on the front lines of the global effort to eradicate the threat of terrorism. Our brave soldiers are fighting and dying for the cause and the sovereignty of the Afghan nation every day. Although we may be on the front lines, the threat knows no boundaries. For terrorist groups that are harboured in the region, attacks in Kabul, Brussels, Paris, Barcelona, London or anywhere else are equal victories. President Trumpâ??â?? new strategy includes the disruption and denial of sanctuary to terrorists, whose motives know no boundaries. However, a strong and enduring commitment from our international partners alone will not ensure our collective success in Afghanistan. The roots of success are indeed within us, as Afghans. Today, nearly three years into our decade of transformation, we are turning Afghanistan into a platform for stability. The foundation has been laid. We have articulated and are rigorously implementing road maps for reform: we are prosecuting the corrupt, ending corruption in the security sector, replacing systems of patronage with merit-based systems and making financial processes transparent. We are also reaching out to those who had previously been excluded from society â?? young people, the poor and women. Yet those people are our nationâ??s source of resilience. The generation that grew up in the 1990s, which makes up the majority of our population, is now being entrusted with wholesale leadership of the country. A generational change is taking place as youth are empowered at every level. This generation will be the one that reforms the Government into one that is citizen- and service-oriented. Through unimaginable hardship, women kept the fabric of our communities and societies together, even as they fell to shreds. Yet women were relegated to the very bottom of society. That was unacceptable, and our nation suffered for it. Today there are more Afghan women in Government, the workforce and active in civil society than ever before in Afghan history, yet we still have far to go. At the helm, we have six women Ambassadors and four women Cabinet members. Simply put, womenâ??s empowerment is crucial to our future. The poor, along with women and young people, are the numerical majorities in Afghanistan that cross ethnic, linguistic, gender and religious lines. About 40 per cent of Afghans still live below the poverty line. Research shows that poverty perpetuates itself because it affects the physiological make-up of a childâ??s brain. We must empower the poor. For too long, they have been the silent majority in our country. We are recreating the bonds of society in order to change the culture of our State. And we are strengthening our bonds not only internally, but regionally. As we look to our neighbours in South and Central Asia, we are simultaneously strengthening national, global and regional connectivity. Afghanistan will again become a multifaceted hub in the twenty-first century for transport, energy, water and mining and for the benefit of the entire regionâ??s economic prosperity and security. We are already seeing the fruits of our labour. Transmission lines for Central and South Asia, power projects are under construction; the Turkmen railway has reached our border; and the Turkmenistan- Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline for natural gas is under construction. As a central part of our plan for economic advancement, we continue to work with our regional partners to seek avenues of collaboration. We can see now, amid the uncertainties and unique challenges and threats of the twenty-first century, how Afghanistan has become a conundrum for the twentieth-century approaches within which the global order tends to still operate. While the threat of international terrorism playing out on our soil has dominated the narrative of our country and driven the fate of our people for far too long, we also have enormous potential to be the regional brokers of peace, a hub for economic prosperity and a beacon of democratic values. The birthplace of Rumi still resounds with messages of love, peace and hope. Afghanistan will yet again be the Asian crossroads for dialogue among civilizations and a model of harmony and culture of tolerance and engagement. I am confident that our plans and programmes for self- reliance and reform, bolstered by the commitment of our international partners, will chart out a path for us towards realizing our full potential.",1,196
7702,Session 72 - 2017,AGO_72_2017.txt,AGO_72_2017,72,2017,AGO,"On	behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola, allow me to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on having been elected to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to assure him of Angolaâ??s full support in the fulfilment of his mission, so that he may successfully provide us with the leadership we need at this time. I also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session, on the capable manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session; and Mr. Antonio Guterres on his appointment to the post of Secretary-General. Allow me to wish Mr. Guterres every success in his mandate and assure him of the full support and cooperation of Angola. As has been reiterated several times in this forum, peace and security are fundamental premises for stability, sustainable development, democracy and the promotion of and respect for human rights. The theme chosen for this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is timely and compels us to collectively reflect on the actions of the United Nations to solve the main problems affecting humankind. We need an Organization capable of promoting international peace and security by acting swiftly to prevent potential conflict situations, improving the global strategy to combat international terrorism, and placing economic and social development issues at the centre of its action. In this context, we appreciate the relevance of the four axes defined in the agenda of this session, namely, the prevention and mediation of conflicts to achieve sustainable peace, the promotion of human rights, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We reiterate Angolaâ??s support for the Secretary- Generalâ??s proposals for reforms with a view to revitalizing and rationalizing the resources of the Organization. The United Nations should act as the first instance in the promotion of peace diplomacy at the global level. We also reiterate the need to reform the Security Council in order to have it reflect the reality of the contemporary world. Its current composition is outdated and needs to be urgently reformed. In line with the African position represented in the Ezulwini Consensus, Angola reiterates the need to increase the number of permanent members to ensure a fair geographical balance. It is unfair that the African continent, which accounts for almost 40 per cent of the States Members of the United Nations, is not represented among the permanent members in the main organ in charge of maintaining peace and security in the world. Angola underlines the importance of multilateralism in solving global problems, in accordance with the logic of shared responsibility and benefits, in recognition of the legitimate interests of all and in concertation towards realistic solutions. Angolaâ??s attachment to multilateralism is strongly emphasized in its role in solving problems that threaten peace and security on the African continent, particularly in the Great Lakes region. In the context of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, Angola has been leading diplomatic efforts, with its regional and international partners, to find a lasting political solution capable of guaranteeing security, stability, economic and social development, and democracy for the countries and peoples of the region. This joint engagement has allowed for a substantial reduction of tensions in the region, with notable advances such as the continuation of the inter-Burundi dialogue, encouraging signs in the resolution of the political crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and positive developments in the peace process in the Central African Republic, which have made it possible to hold elections in the country leading to the normalization of its institutions. Despite these advances, we still have a long way to go on the path towards fully stabilizing that part of our continent, and the parties involved carry the main responsibility for ending the violence, respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the citizens of their respective countries, and building their national political institutions. In this context, they must demonstrate through action their commitment to and engagement with peace agreements and other political platforms either negotiated directly or sponsored by regional institutions and the international community. The international communityâ??s collective action under the auspices of the United Nations should also cover the fight against terrorism. In this fight, a significant part of our effort should be directed at combating the causes of terrorism and violent extremism, which reside, inter alia, in the social crises in and the institutional fragility of many States. The case of Libya is a blatant example of this reality. The African continent has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, which has killed innocent civilians, caused extensive damage to property and destroyed the way of life of many of its countries. Angola fully supports the efforts of the African Union, with the assistance of its international partners, to confront the scourge of terrorism. Two years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development â?? an important instrument to guide the development strategies of our States. We hope that its implementation over the next 13 years will substantially reduce the major social deficiencies affecting developing nations in particular. The economic and financial difficulties affecting most countries have had a negative impact on the mobilization of financial resources for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially among the poorest, most vulnerable countries with limited internal resources. International efforts aimed at securing critical financial resources should be guided by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, adopted in 2015. The Republic of Angola, which is now beginning a new cycle in its life as a nation, is strongly engaged in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, despite an adverse global economic environment. To that end, Angola has launched its national development plan, aimed at rehabilitating and modernizing economic and social infrastructure, promoting public and private investment, and enhancing training, qualification and the adequate management of human resources. The world is moving towards consensus in recognizing the urgency of combating climate change. To this end, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is extremely important in the development of enabling tools for protecting the right to development and strengthening resilience in developing countries. Angola views the Agreement as a historic commitmentand an encouragement to contain global warming and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent need for the world to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement has been dramatically highlighted by the recent climate-related disasters in various parts of the world. Angola joins in solidarity with the victims in the Caribbean, Mexico, the United States and other parts of the world. In order to address this and other challenges facing the international community, Angola will continue to be a safe and responsible partner of the United Nations and contribute to the implementation of its agenda in an engaged manner. We are increasingly able and fit to play a decisive role in restoring peace and security, particularly in Africa, as well as in furthering its economic development. To that end, Angola has remained stable, and the pacification of the country has definitely been achieved. The Republic of Angola recently held its third general elections in peacetime, in a climate of tranquillity, respect for differences and great civility, demonstrating the stability prevailing in the country and that the gradual consolidation of democracy is a fact. The priorities of the new Government will focus on economic development with particular attention on combating poverty, reducing inequalities, combating unemployment, and improving governance insufficiencies and development indicators as a sine qua non for building a prosperous and democratic society. Regrettably, peace is still not prevalent in many regions. Concerning Guinea-Bissau, a country linked to Angola by historical and brotherly ties, we remain confident and expectant regarding the resolution of the political impasse. In this regard, we strongly support the efforts of all the Guinean, regional and international political and social actors, including the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the United Nations, the European Union and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. The issue of Western Sahara continues to merit the due attention of the United Nations to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant Security Council and African Union resolutions. Angola encourages the main parties involved to continue the dialogue in order to resolve the dispute, which has lasted too long. In the Middle East, we are concerned about the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Angola argues that the solution lies in the acceptance and existence of two States, living side by side in peace and security. The tension we are now witnessing in the Korean peninsula poses a very serious threat to international peace and security. Angola joins the voices advocating for a diplomatic solution and compliance with international non-proliferation instruments. The peoples of the region deserve to live in peace and not haunted by the spectre of a conflict whose effects would be devastating and unacceptable to the human conscience. Angola promptly welcomed the steps taken to normalize relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America, which will benefit the two peoples. The complete lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo would contribute significantly to easing tensions between the two countries and would eliminate one of the last remnants of the Cold War. This would also bring about a more stable and peaceful environment for development in the Latin American region. This unilateral measure â?? the embargo â?? limits the Cuban peopleâ??s enjoyment of development, and its extraterritorial effects violate the principles and norms of international law. The promotion and protection of human rights have always been at the forefront of Angolaâ??s foreign priorities, as evidenced by the fact that it is a party to the main international human rights instruments and maintains an exemplary cooperation and ongoing dialogue with United Nations human rights mechanisms. It is in this context that Angola is a candidate for a seat on the Human Rights Council in the elections that will take place in October 2017. We look forward to participating actively in and contributing to the protection of human rights in the regions and countries most affected by violations of these rights. In this regard, we would highly appreciate the support of the members of the Assembly for our candidacy. I would like to conclude by urging Member States to renew their confidence in the United Nations and strengthen international dialogue as a key element of a culture of peace, respect for differences among peoples, conflict prevention and the foundations of progress and development, to which all the peoples of the world have the right and are entitled.",1,196
7703,Session 72 - 2017,ALB_72_2017.txt,ALB_72_2017,72,2017,ALB,"How many times has it happened that humankind has been confronted with as many complex challenges in such a relatively short time as is the case nowadays? Has there ever been another period in what we call modern times when we have had to deal with so many pressing issues at once? When was the last time we remember that we were all confronted with such a conflicting prospect â?? on the one hand, of an inspiring world that grows richer by the hour, driven by the tremendous progress of science and technology, and on the other of a planet that seems to have lost its way, its energy and its vision and to be spiralling erratically downwards? There are no simple answers to complex questions. Yet facts are stubborn, and in many respects reality looks grim. Global terrorism and extremism continue to threaten our values and our way of life. They have become a persistent threat, with the ability to strike everywhere, indiscriminately and with far-reaching consequences, as we have sadly witnessed so many times, including in the recent past. Several brutal and seemingly intractable conflicts continue to devastate the lives of millions of people, thereby threatening the future of entire generations. Armed conflicts are nowadays more complex, the actors involved more numerous, the weapons and tactics more sophisticated and the consequences, which continue to inflict endless human suffering, more dire. The approximately 65 million people, the highest number since the Second World War, who have been forcefully and brutally uprooted from their homes constitute an indictment of our collective failure. Climate change, a defiant truth that some still dare to question, is putting our very survival at risk. It constitutes one the most fundamental challenges for our century, as it continues to cause growing humanitarian stress. Disasters are becoming more frequent and intense, and one example, the current hurricane season in the Atlantic, reminds us that nature will always have the upper hand unless we become aware of the need to quickly adapt our way of life and protect our planet, our lives and those of our children. The international global order has been seriously challenged without anything credible or promising to replace it. Worse, the situation in North-East Asia, a prolonged and recently exacerbated crisis sparked by the policy of a stubborn and paranoid totalitarian regime, has brought back the dreadful fear of nuclear confrontation. Inequality has continued to grow, while, in contrast, the world becomes wealthier, which casts serious doubt on the validity of promises and guarantees of positive results for the benefit of all so often advocated for from this very rostrum. No country, however large, rich or powerful, can face or solve such problems alone. The challenges require a unified vision and a concerted response. In an increasingly globalized world, our visions and actions should be inclusive and universal and bring people, communities and countries together. As the leader of a small nation, I hereby reiterate our pledge that we will faithfully do our part. The increase in violent extremism and the number of non-State armed groups perpetrating atrocities, particularly against ethnic and religious minorities, continue to represent one of our most pressing challenges. The decisive action taken by the international coalition has paid off. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) has lost almost 90 per cent of the territory it once controlled, and its ability to wage war has been severely diminished. Yet let us make no mistake; its defeat on the ground does not mean that it will disappear. Our response to the extremism and radicalization that leads to terrorism must continue and adapt to the nature of that persistent threat itself. Albania was among the first countries to join the Global Coalition in the fight against ISIS and international terrorism. We are now implementing a three-year action plan as an instrument for implementing our national strategy on countering violent extremism. We welcome the increased attention that has been given to the role of regional organizations in security issues. In that respect, we greatly appreciate and welcome the close cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union (EU) on the Common Security and Defence Policy platform. All over the world, people want to be safe and free from violence, oppression, persecution and fear. They want to be treated with dignity and know that their lives matter, regardless of gender, race, national or social origin, religious belief, political affiliation, property, birth or any other status. To achieve those goals, we need to go beyond declaratory undertakings. People rightly demand us to show responsibility and an ability to act. The pledge to leave no one behind is the central theme of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. Albania is fully committed to protecting and promoting all human rights, particularly womenâ??s rights, which is another major battle for change that my Government is leading. I am proud to announce that, for the second time in a row in Albanian history, half of the members of my Government are women. They bring leadership skills, strength of character, commitment to our European values and special devotion to serving the Albanian people. Furthermore, women count for approximately 30 per cent of the members of our Parliament and more than 45 per cent of our public administration. Those may sound like mere statistics, but they rather reflect a platform that ensures that the role of women in development and change is recognized, their rightful place in the society is secured and their voice is heard. It is my deep belief that the empowerment of women serves as a powerful driver of overall economic development and national prosperity. One of the main national priorities for my country is to join the European Union. It is not just one of our foreign policy objectives and is not a contractual relation of sorts. For us, European integration lies at the heart of our overall development, since it touches every cell of our development architecture. We are resolved to deliver on the fundamentals that consolidate the pillars of a democratic State, a functioning economy and a Government that works for its citizens. We want to measure our progress with results, and the very thorough justice reform we are implementing is a shining example of that. In turn, we expect our EU partners to do their part and to clear the way towards finally opening accession talks. It will be a historic milestone, but also a strong encouragement for us to continue on the same path. We hope that the European Union, despite the current crisis, continues to believe that the enlargement process remains the best European catalyst for security, peace, development and prosperity. It has proved so in the past and remains the right bet for the future. A couple of months ago, at the general elections, I was re-elected as Head of Government by the citizens of Albania. They have agreed with our plans for the Albania we want. Expectations are high, and so is our resolve to meet them. Our target is to ensure a sustainable economic growth of 5 per cent during my current mandate. That brings me to one of my favourite subjects â?? the development of regional cooperation and the transformation of the Western Balkans into an area of free movement for people, goods, capitals and ideas, benefiting everyone in the region. That remains one of the main pillars of our foreign policy. There were times in the past when we would come here and spend time and energy competing with some of our neighbours on how to belittle each other, telling our one-sided stories and trying to convince the world of our specific narratives. Hopefully, that is long gone. The best proof of the profound change in the Western Balkans lies in our joint efforts, with a shared sense of responsibility and a common purpose to make the region a natural part of Europe. Together with the European Union, and based on its principles and policies, we are working to bring down every barrier to free trade by encouraging transnational economies. A new and vibrant regional economic area, which we agreed on in July in Trieste, will boost trade and benefit our economies. I do not have the slightest doubt that it will help us to protect and promote everyoneâ??s national interests, respect the rights of minorities, strengthen good neighbourly relations and move our countries and the region as a whole towards the European Union. Strong and healthy relations with the European Union have proved key to stability and reform progress in the Balkans. We have noticed that when the EU is overly preoccupied with itself, that bond is fragile and insecure. That is why this important relationship should be continually nurtured and strengthened, because it also facilitates regional cooperation, increased understanding and work towards reconciliation in the best European tradition and record. As President Junker stated just a few weeks ago in his address on the state of the European Union, there is need for a credible enlargement perspective so that the Western Balkans can attain more stability in the EU. Revitalizing the enlargement policy will be the best deterrent to the disintegration narrative that is fuelled by populist ideas. It is my firm belief that as much as we need the European Union, the European Union needs a stronger, more developed and coherent Western Balkans. We are well aware of that. And practice has shown that in order to build a fully functioning region, all of its members must be treated the same way. That is why we think that the admission of Kosovo to every regional body, with the same rights as other countries, is of paramount significance. Many have used the Assembly over the past years to express worries and fear that Kosovoâ??s independence would unleash dark forces that no one would be able to control. We have seen nothing of the sort. Instead, what has really happened it that Albanians in Kosovo and Albania, as well as Serbs, once threatened with extermination by a brutal regime, are now free citizens living in democratic countries and contributing to further developing an open society. Who can deny the impressive achievements made by Kosovo in less than a decade of independence? They include the consolidation of its democratic institutions, good governance, exemplary multi-ethnic and interreligious coexistence and evident progress in the Euro-Atlantic integration process. Every credible report on the current situation in the Western Balkans would undoubtedly lead to the same conclusion â?? today the Western Balkans is far better off than it was three or five years ago, let alone 10. Kosovoâ??s independence has not unleashed any dark forces. On the contrary, it has brought stability to the entire region. For several years, Serbia and Kosovo have been engaged in serious dialogue on the normalization of their relations, with the mediation and facilitation of the European Union. After centuries of mistrust, a climate of trust and regional cooperation for both countries is a growing reality. That serves as an even greater reason to remind those countries that have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider doing so as soon as possible. That should not be seen as defiance or a loss, as it is often wrongly portrayed. We have said it before and we will say it again: recognizing Kosovo, establishing relations and helping Kosovo move forward, which is something that 114 Member States have done so far, constitute a direct contribution to bettering the lives of Kosovoâ??s citizens and investing in the security and stability of the whole region and all of its countries, including Serbia. Let me conclude by highlighting the need for the United Nations to change in order to remain relevant, live up to its responsibilities, secure the promise of sustainable development, ensure human rights and guarantee peace and security for future generations. We are aware that such reform is about what we can and must do together in order to better support our common efforts in transforming lives. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development points the way towards a better future, the future we want and the future that our children deserve. We cannot and must not fail to deliver on that promise. Albania stands ready to do its part and cooperate with all those willing to invest in the future and make our world a better place for all.",1,196
7704,Session 72 - 2017,AND_72_2017.txt,AND_72_2017,72,2017,AND,"I would like to begin by congratulating the President, Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, on his choice of theme for the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. The link between peace and a dignified life is, without a doubt, one of the key issues of our time â?? as is sustainable development, which has become the principal challenge facing the international community. The priorities set forth by the President and the theme for the current session highlight the close link between peace, a dignified life and a sustainable planet. The choice of those priorities and theme are in keeping with what we have been building together over the years, as reflected in the aims of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we agreed on two years ago, and are also based on the actions of the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, during his first nine months at the helm of the United Nations. Next year will mark 70 years since the publication of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first major joint success of the United Nations. Throughout those seven decades, we have learned that the goals shared by all of humankind are interrelated. The United Nations was founded with the fundamental aim of preventing conflicts and ensuring peace. Over the centuries, all our parliaments and assemblies have been established on the basis of that goal, namely, to peacefully resolve conflicts and make decisions that affect us all together. This parliament, an assembly of all the countries of the world, was also founded on that very desire. Soon afterwards, the original objective of maintaining peace and security was joined by those of promoting human rights and, subsequently, by the economic and social development of nations and their citizens. That in itself was because the international community became aware of the strong relationship between development opportunities and the prevention of conflict. A fairer world with fewer inequalities, with opportunities for all and respect for our differences, will tend to be a safer and more peaceful world. It was several decades ago that the United Nations turned its focus towards another major objective, namely, sustainability, caring for the environment and, more specifically, the fight against climate change. In June we marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Its four objectives â?? peace, human rights, development and sustainability â?? continue to be priorities. All four are tightly interconnected, and all four require a multilateral approach, since no country, no matter how powerful, can guarantee peace and security alone. No country or group of countries can implement development policies alone, and no country can fight climate change alone. We must therefore continue to uphold inclusive multilateralism. It is not enough to simply work together to resolve issues that affect us all â?? the solutions we agree on should leave no one behind. They must be fair and inclusive, and we must make sure that they benefit us all. It is in that spirit that Andorra has become a member of the Economic and Social Council for 2017 to 2019, because it is in that Council that inclusive multilateralism is truly significant. The Economic and Social Council is the clearest manifestation that the United Nations not only strives to be an assembly of the worldâ??s countries but also wants to have a direct impact on the lives of citizens all over the world. If, as the Secretary-General stated, development is the key to conflict prevention, the Economic and Social Council is a key tool for that. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also plays a key role. For that reason, Andorra will participate in the next round of voluntary national reviews of the Sustainable Development Goals, which will evaluate our implementation of the 2030 Agenda and accelerate its effective application. Everyone here knows that we live in a world of constant assessment. Rating agencies measure the solvency of our countries, the World Trade Organization analyses the level of openness and interdependence of our economies and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ensures transparency and healthy fiscal competition between States. Never before have we experienced the evaluative capacity of various international agencies and bodies so intensely, especially in the economic and financial sphere. That is a positive thing, but it will not be if we limit those evaluations to the economic and financial sphere. We must be equally demanding in the social sphere â?? although economic progress does indeed play a very important role in constructing a fairer and safer world. The promotion of a decent life and social development are also essential elements. That is what the voluntary national reviews are â?? a means of measuring all we are doing to attain the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. Andorra will submit its voluntary report next July. The various ministries and departments of the Andorran Government have, in fact, been working for some time to align our internal policies with the 2030 Agenda and ensure that our internal actions comply with each of the 17 Goals to which we all committed on 25 September 2015. From a social perspective, the work that Andorra has done over the past year to develop a white paper on equality as a basis for cross-cutting actions to foster inclusion in both the public and the private sectors is a clear example. When I say that Andorra is developing this white paper, I mean the country as a whole, not just the Government. Of course, the Government and Parliament must act as initiators and leaders, but they do so with the full participation of civil society. The white paper will lead to a law on equality, which should be the key tool in our effort to eradicate the discrimination that still persists in our society. All that work is clearly aligned with Goal 5 on gender equality and Goal 10 on reducing inequalities within and among countries. Inclusive multilateralism, which I mentioned a few moments ago, should not only prevail in the General Assembly but should also guide our internal policies. At the national level, we need to involve the largest possible number of actors and find solutions that work for everyone. There are also other examples of Andorraâ??s efforts in the context of domestic policy, such as in the area of education, which is directly linked to Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda. In that regard, we are working to introduce competency-based education; to continue and improve the coexistence of our three educational systems â?? in Spanish, French and Andorran â?? all of which are public, free of charge and open to all; and to incorporate human rights and democratic values in our curriculums for children and young people. All three of those efforts are also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, and in some instances are inspired by them. A good example of our commitment to international educational standards is the Governmentâ??s recent adoption of the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, a key international instrument for promoting equal opportunity. While the relationship between peace, human rights, security and inclusive development is clear and undeniable, it is also increasingly obvious that combating climate change is a crucial pillar of that edifice. That is because the destruction of ecosystems and the natural disasters linked to climate change directly and cruelly affect the most vulnerable people; because a scarcity of natural resources is at the heart of many current conflicts; because the new paradigm of sustainability drastically changes our previous notion of economic and social development; and because â?? and pardon me for mentioning the obvious â?? if we destroy the planet, there will be no sense in talking about peace, security or development. Fighting climate change will therefore continue to take up much of the debate now and in the future on international actions and initiatives. That is why seven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are directly related to environmental issues. It is key that much of the our Governmentsâ?? domestic efforts should address that issue. In recent times, Andorra has become very aware of the relevance of fighting climate change, and we have demonstrated that through actions. Thanks to an ambitious aid programme, Andorra has one of the worldâ??s most significant growth rates per inhabitant for electric automobiles and numbers of points for charging electric vehicles. Given that heating buildings is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, we are investing substantially in network projects that centralize heat generation, making it more efficient and less polluting. We are also implementing a policy of incentives and obligations to promote citizensâ?? own production of renewable solar and geothermal energy. Lastly, we are drafting a law on energy transition that will make all such policies mandatory. As most members of the international community stated in December 2015, we do not want this effort to remain merely pious words or a catalogue of good intentions that will not be translated into concrete action. We therefore welcome the initiative of Mr. Emmanuel Macron, the President of our partner country, France, to promote a global compact for the environment, which will collect and harmonize all of the agreements signed and implemented since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 through to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change â?? because it is important that all global action to protect the environment and fight climate change be reflected in specific rights and obligations for States and individuals. Andorra heartily welcomes the work that has been done so far for the global compact, which includes, as a substantive right for individuals, the right to a sound and healthy environment. Here, our 1993 Constitution was a bellwether, as it includes the right to a clean environment as a citizensâ?? right and, therefore, a duty for the public authorities. The various international conventions aimed at protecting the environment must be reflected in specific actions that will have tangible effects for people, because the negative effects of climate change and global warming have been apparent for some time and are having a very negative effect on the planet and its inhabitants. I have in mind especially the concerns we have about the Pacific islands, which are threatened by a rise in sea levels, the fragile ecosystems of mountainous countries such as Andorra, and the extraordinary, devastating force of the hurricanes that have been hitting the Caribbean region recently. More than ever before, we need inclusive multilateralism that will leave no one behind. But we also need effective multilateralism that works, offers concrete results and responds to peopleâ??s problems. Work to that end begins here at United Nations Headquarters, which must adjust the Organization to the needs of both countries and their citizens. The first mission of any organization, from private companies to Governments, is an internal one â?? ensuring that its members and structures are aligned with its final objectives and that they are well prepared to respond to various needs. We therefore welcome the fact that one of the first steps taken by Secretary-General Guterres was on his project to reform the United Nations development system. If we really believe that peace, human rights, development and sustainability are closely interrelated, we would logically expect the various bodies and committees dealing with such issues to work together in a coordinated manner, just as it is logical and necessary for specific problems to be managed by specific departments. Proof of the fact that the Secretary- General is doing a good job is his decision to establish a United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism headed by an Under-Secretary-General. The importance of fighting terrorism has been trumpeted everywhere in recent years. We Andorrans have seen our European neighbours suffer directly from the consequences of such irrational hatred. In Spain last month, Barcelona and Cambrils, two Catalan towns that are close to Andorra, suffered from the problem. Peace and security have more complex dimensions today than they did 70 years ago. In the mid-twentieth century, after two world wars, the maintenance of peace and security could be addressed and resolved here in the Assembly through frank dialogue and effective cooperation and among countries. Bilateral diplomacy also played a significant role. Today, with the global threat of terrorism, while diplomacy between States continues to be very important in settling issues of peace and security, they also require concrete action for combating terrorism and eradicating its root causes. The Secretary-General can therefore count on Andorraâ??s support for his establishment of the Office of Counter- Terrorism and other measures designed to improve the functioning of the Organization and provide the effective answers that citizens of the world expect from all of us. The question of the effectiveness of the United Nations is important not only for the Secretary-General but also clearly for all of us States Members of the Organization. It is all of us who must work to ensure that global agreements, starting with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, are truly binding, to assess with transparency various countriesâ?? compliance with those agreements and to avoid the possibility that the United Nations and the international community could become paralysed or inactive in the face of the great challenges and major crises of our times. It is for those reasons that Andorra has supported, and will continue to support, the Rome Statute and the Kampala Amendments, which make it possible for the International Criminal Court to exercise its jurisdiction in cases of crimes of aggression that clearly violate the Charter of the United Nations. Allowing the Court to act ex officio in the most serious cases without the need for referrals by the Security Council would be a meaningful step forward for the rule of law at the international level. For the same reason, Andorra will continue to support initiatives that seek to limit the right of the veto for the permanent members of the Security Council in cases of genocide or serious human rights violations. In our opinion, the political declaration adopted two years ago on the initiative of the French Republic and the United Mexican States, which provides for the suspension of the veto in cases involving mass atrocities, is a good course of action to follow. No one should be surprised by the fact that Andorrans are faithful defenders of the multilateral order. Like other small countries, we firmly believe that the major challenges of our time must be addressed globally, and that what the various countries of the world can do for themselves amounts to very little without global and concerted action. That is why much of our foreign policy is focused on multilateral forums, as we showed four years ago during the Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe. Evidence for that will also be seen next month, when Andorra hosts the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and from our candidacy to organize the Ibero-American Summit in 2020. The Ibero-American community is in mourning today for the victims of the earthquake that took place in Mexico last Tuesday. The Government and the Mexican people know that they can count on the sympathy and solidarity of the Principality of Andorra. As I have said, our dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations is clear and firm. Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres can rely on Andorra to help build a sustainable, safe and fair world that involves everyone, with no one left behind.",1,196
7705,Session 72 - 2017,ARE_72_2017.txt,ARE_72_2017,72,2017,ARE,"I would like to begin by congratulating the President on his leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We are confident that his deep experience in international affairs will contribute to the Assemblyâ??s success, and we stand ready to provide him with all the support and cooperation he may need. I would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his stewardship of the previous session. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my countryâ??s appreciation for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to reform the work of the United Nations in conflict prevention and the achievement of peace and security. We fully support his vision, which requires the international community to cooperate more closely on existing and emerging global challenges. The foreign policy of the United Arab Emirates is guided by principles consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law â?? a spirit of partnership, support for the rule of law, good neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. They lead us to support a stronger role for the United Nations, along with reform of its entities and systems, so that it can fulfil its mandate to maintain international peace and security and help countries achieve development and prosperity. The United Arab Emirates works hard and responsibly within its region and beyond to promote the stability and development of Arab countries and tackle the destruction wrought in our region by wars that have left total devastation in their wake. We see security and stability as key to the advancement of nations and peoples, a promising future for younger generations and a decent life for all. Our collective priority must be to promote peace and stability. Despite serious regional and international efforts, our region continues to suffer from crises whose causes include extremism and terrorism, persistent interference by States in one anotherâ??s internal affairs, aggressive and expansionist policies driven by hegemonic ambitions, and regimes that seek influence by providing support to extremist and terrorist groups, with the goal of undermining Governmentsâ?? legitimacy. We must protect that legitimacy and prevent the spread of chaos and conflict throughout the region and the world. These crises have had enormous costs in terms of human life, the displacement of millions and the destruction of infrastructure. If the situation persists, it will generate only more violence and devastation and deplete economic and cultural resources, not just in our region but all over the world. There is no doubt that we as an international community have achieved great progress in confronting security and humanitarian threats, but more can be done to restore stability in the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates therefore believes that we should take the following initial steps in the region. First, we should safeguard the progress that has already been made on development and counter any hindrances to our collective peacebuilding efforts, or we will be reduced solely to managing conflicts. That applies particularly to Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, countries where comprehensive political solutions are possible and stability can be restored. But that can be achieved only if we end external interference in Arab affairs and suppress all forms of support to extremist and terrorist groups. In that regard, we support United Nations efforts to bring the parties to those conflicts to the negotiating table and to achieve comprehensive political solutions to the crises in our region. Secondly, we must unite in firm and wholehearted rejection of extremism and terrorism in all their manifestations. That is the only way to confront and eradicate those scourges. We believe that the Arab- Islamic-American summit in Riyadh was historic by any standard. It attracted an unprecedented level of attendance at the highest levels, including the important participation of the President of the United States. Its outcome demonstrated that the Arab and Islamic world has taken a firm stand against the ideological roots of terrorism. We believe that, while eliminating this threat from our Arab region is a difficult task, the campaigns to liberate such ancient and storied Arab cities as Mosul in Iraq and Mukalla in Yemen from the grip of terrorist organizations have shown that we can achieve a great deal if we work together in combating extremism and terrorism. Thirdly, we must take collective action to identify countries that support and finance terrorism and hold them accountable. That is why the United Arab Emirates, together with its close allies the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, has taken measures aimed at stopping Qatarâ??s support for extremism and terrorism and forcing it to abandon policies that have destabilized the region. We are committed to protecting our national interests, the security of the Arabian Gulf and the stability of our region. The alliances between certain parties in our region with organizations or entities whose goal is to undermine peace and security in the Arab region and the world are unacceptable. That is a gamble in which we will all be losers. Let us stand united against those who finance, promote and justify extremism and terrorism. We have a clear choice, and there is no alternative to combating terrorism in all its manifestations and facing down all its perpetrators, without exception. We must have zero tolerance for those who spread violence, fear and destruction among innocent people or provide support and safe havens to terrorist groups. Together with its friends in the region, my country has therefore taken sovereign measures, in line with international law, with a view to protecting Arab security and standing against Qatarâ??s support to terrorism. Fourthly, we must promote compassion, tolerance and inclusion, because today more than ever the Arab region needs those values in order to counter the misleading messages and ideologies spread by extremists and terrorist groups, especially through social media. My country is working with regional and international partners to establish mechanisms that can remind our young people of our shared human values and counter the rhetoric of terrorism. Specifically, the United Arab Emirates has established and hosts specialized institutions such as the Sawab Centre, the Hedayah International Centre of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism and the Muslim Council of Elders, whose purpose is to demonstrate the peaceful nature of our Islamic religion and constitute a forum for promoting peace in Muslim societies. We have learned from experience that we must expose extremism and terrorism and the rhetoric surrounding them in order to defeat them intellectually and provide an alternative narrative based on the principle of peaceful coexistence and tolerance. At the same time, such institutions promote a culture of peaceful coexistence and tolerance. It is regrettable, however, that some countries are funding media platforms that encourage violence, incite hatred and sectarianism and provide a forum for the murderous ideologies of terrorism. History has repeatedly shown that catastrophic consequences await those who follow such paths. Our international efforts to achieve peace in our region will not be successful if we fail to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab territory, which has continued for seven decades. The situation makes young people vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist groups that claim that they are fighting only for liberation and to realize their aspirations. Iranâ??s hostile and expansionist policies continue to be the common factor in all the crises that our region has experienced, and a real obstacle to any concrete progress in resolving them. Iran interferes in the internal affairs of other States and arms and supports terrorist groups such as the Houthis and Hizbullah, as well as groups and cells in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait. Iran has not only blatantly violated the principle of sovereignty but has continued to exploit the crises in the Arab world in order to undermine regional security and incite and fuel conflict. It must realize that only peaceful coexistence, based on mutual respect for sovereignty, is a viable basis for harmonious relations in the region. From this rostrum, we reaffirm our firm position on the issue of and our legitimate right to sovereignty over the three islands of Greater Tunbs, Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, which Iran has occupied in violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We will not abandon our demand that Iran return the occupied islands to their rightful owners, through voluntary or other peaceful means and in accordance with the resolutions that have been adopted in that regard, together with the rulings of the International Court of Justice. Two years have passed since the signing of the nuclear agreement with Iran, with no sign of change in its hostile behaviour. It continues to develop its nuclear programme and violates the letter and spirit of the agreement. We therefore support enhanced controls on Iranâ??s nuclear programme and continued assessment of the agreement and its provisions. We view North Koreaâ??s similarly provocative behaviour, through its continued development of its nuclear programme and ballistic missiles, as having only one purpose â?? acquiring further destructive power with which to threaten peace and stability in its region and the rest of the world. Iran and North Koreaâ??s aggressive policies are not consistent with their membership in an international organization whose primary concern is the maintenance of international peace and security. If we are to restore security in our region and protect our peoples from conflicts and extremism, we must make development, in both its human and strategic dimensions, our top priority. We must create opportunities and hope for younger generations so that they can look forward to a better tomorrow with optimism and confidence. My country is committed to achieving economic and human progress and has contributed to rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in conflict-affected countries in order to enable them to restore security and stability. We continue our humanitarian approach to alleviating the suffering of refugees. We support refugees internationally and regionally, with a view to protecting them and improving their living conditions by providing humanitarian and development assistance. However, we would like to stress that managing crises by providing such assistance alone is not a sustainable solution if we fail to address their root causes. In that regard, we would like to reiterate the importance of ensuring that the United Nations can arrive at solutions to humanitarian and political crises and address their grave implications, with a particular focus on recent acts of violence and ethnic cleansing such as have been committed in Myanmar against the Rohingya. The United Arab Emirates condemns the violence, displacement and collective punishment that have been visited on the Rohingya and will continue to provide them with assistance in order to reduce their suffering. In that context, I should also mention the Houthi rebelsâ?? obstinate rejection of a political settlement to the crisis and the humanitarian initiatives in Yemen, which is preventing progress from being made on resolving the issue. We will nonetheless continue to work diligently and with determination on the political and humanitarian processes in Yemen, alongside our friends and brothers and under Saudi Arabiaâ??s wise leadership, with the goal of addressing the humanitarian and development needs of the Yemeni people, especially women and children, and with a view to restoring stability there. The United Arab Emirates believes that by looking to the future, promoting human values, working to achieve human development and responding to the aspirations of young people, we can create the foundations for further development and prosperity. My country has moved beyond the stage of establishing its infrastructure and fulfilling basic needs, including by providing health, nutrition and education services, and has adopted a model based on the principles of good governance and values of tolerance and on its vision for building a contented society. We have also created a safe environment that can enable women and young people to fulfil their dreams and ambitions while engaging in their countryâ??s development. As a result, we have been able to pioneer innovations and other groundbreaking achievements and have become a beacon of hope for younger generations throughout the region. We are cognizant that our greatest challenge is to make our development sustainable and prepare ourselves for the post-oil era. That will be vital to our survival. The United Arab Emirates considers its values and principles to be a human and historic legacy celebrated and passed on by one generation to another. We have therefore declared 2018 the year of Zayed, in memory and recognition of the achievements of the founding father of the United Arab Emirates and with the aim of enshrining his values as we continue his journey to build and advance our nation. We stand at a historic juncture. On the one hand, we have those who pursue peace, development, modernity and the future, while on the other we have those who have chosen darkness, destruction, sabotage and chaos. In that essential and just confrontation, we must stand united. Our goal must be the eradication of extremism and terrorism and the elimination of the forces that are tearing our region apart. We will then have a clear path towards a brighter future that is full of hope.",1,196
7706,Session 72 - 2017,ARG_72_2017.txt,ARG_72_2017,72,2017,ARG,"I am very honoured and very happy to be here today representing my country and my Government. As an Argentine and a Latin American, I cannot begin my statement without first expressing my solidarity and the solidarity of Argentina with those afflicted by the tragic earthquake in Mexico, which adds to the devastation caused by successive hurricanes in the Caribbean. The environment and the forces of nature are speaking to us and presenting us with challenges. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election and on his renewed commitment to the task of focusing our responsibilities as Governments on people. I believe that that is our most important mission. If the international community is striving for peace, dialogue and understanding, and if we working against poverty, violence and intolerance, Argentina will always be there to offer its support. The leaders of the world have agreed on a plan of action in favour of people and the planet, namely, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which stipulates that the eradication of poverty in all its forms is the greatest challenge facing the world in its efforts to achieve sustainable development. In keeping with that global aspiration, our Government has established as one of the central axes of its programme the goal of moving decisively towards zero poverty. As a sign of that commitment at the international level, Argentina presented its first voluntary national review of its implementation of the 2030 Agenda in July. We in Argentina are working to create a country where there is equal opportunity for all. That is why we are also focusing on the creation of jobs and inclusive education. On that note, it is worth mentioning that we will host the fourth Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication of Child Labour in November, where we will tackle issues such as the eradication of forced labour and the promotion of high-quality youth employment. A debate on the future of work goes hand in hand with empowering our young people through high-quality education. We dream of a world where a childâ??s destiny and a young personâ??s future have no limits other than their talent, intelligence, determination, will power and desire to succeed in life. The promotion and protection of human rights is a State policy of Argentina that has been sustained since we recovered our democracy in 1983. In that vein, we have been working closely with other actors in the regional and international systems for this to be effective. I take this opportunity to reiterate that our country has presented its candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2020. We count on membersâ?? support. One of Argentinaâ??s priorities is to ensure gender equality. We believe that it is important to educate our communities with the aim of eliminating the various forms of hidden violence within our society. For that reason, our Government has committed to implementing programmes that eliminate gender violence and achieve the full empowerment of women and girls, including their political and economic autonomy, within the framework of our first national plan of action for the prevention, assistance and eradication of violence against women. Our Government has placed special emphasis on the commitments made along with the international community in the framework of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, which was incorporated into our Constitution in 2014. In taking ownership of the spirit of Convention, we have established an agency that focuses on policymaking for disabled persons. The design and implementation of a national plan is essential in terms of participation and working together with disabled persons. As that is an issue that I am personally involved in, I commit to working tirelessly to ensure that the national plan covers all areas referred to in the Convention. From my own perspective as a person with an acquired disability, I wish to express here in the Hall the deep commitment that both President Macri and I have to changing the distorted view held by our culture towards disability. I would also like to mention the global problem of drugs, which knows no limits or borders. We must cooperate and unite our efforts in order to confront it. The fight against drug trafficking is another of our Presidentâ??s three main policies: we must redouble our international commitments to tackle that scourge. In Argentina we are working in that vein to find a consensus that will enable us to create an international court against organized crime in our region of Latin America. It is with sadness that I refer to the situation that our sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is facing. On 8 August, 12 States of Americas met in Lima to condemn the rupture in the democratic order and the systematic violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the violence, repression, political persecution, the existence of political prisoners and lack of free elections in that country. It pains me to speak such words about a kindred country that is so dear to Argentina, and so, from this rostrum, I call for credible negotiations in good faith, building on a consensus of the parties that is oriented towards the peaceful re-establishment of democracy in Venezuela. The Government of Argentina once again reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. I wish to convey the condolences of our people to the victims of that scourge and their families. We know all too well what we speak of: my country has directly suffered from terrorism, having been the victim of two major attacks on the city of Buenos Aires, one in 1992 against the Embassy of Israel and then in 1994 against the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) headquarters. I wish to reiterate the will of the Republic of Argentina to bring to justice all those who participated in the financing, planning, preparation and execution of those terrorist attacks. The continued investigation of the attack on AMIA calls for the appearance of the accused at a hearing. We do not want another 20 years to pass without justice being served. That is why we call on the international community to support us in our requests for cooperation from the Islamic Republic of Iran, which we have been submitting for some time in order to shed light on this terrorist attack. For our Government, the new role of developing countries requires the design of an international architecture in finance and trade matters that is oriented towards inclusive, sustainable and balanced economic growth. In that context, Argentina reaffirms its determination to integrate with the world by building bridges with the international community. We have demonstrated that by taking on the responsibilities of hosting the eleventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) next December in Buenos Aires and the presidency of the Group of 20 Summit in 2018, among others. We maintain our commitment to achieving positive outcomes at the Ministerial Conference, which should reaffirm the importance of the multilateral trade system, and of the WTO as its keystone. It should also ensure that the benefits of free trade reach all those who seek development, the creation of jobs, the eradication of poverty and the correction of trade distortions, particularly in relation to global agriculture and livestock markets. The South American Common Market is our main tool for entering the international market. We know that in the twenty-first century we cannot achieve development in our countries individually, just as we cannot do so in our personal lives. Nothing can be done alone, and we are always in need of others to enrich our projects and our lives. We must strengthen our capacities and resources and establish the foundation we need for growth. The current global situation presents challenges to us that confirm Argentinaâ??s decision to expand trade and improve our profile as a country for investment. That has led us to establish a Southern Common Market in accordance with focused regionalism to attract investments and to strengthen participation in global value chains, which will have special emphasis and effect on small and medium- sized enterprises, generating more and better jobs. That is why we have strongly encouraged negotiations with the European Union, and those negotiations are entering their final phase. We are also negotiating with the European Free Trade Association, and we will soon be doing the same with Canada and with the Republic of Korea. We have also intensified our links with the Pacific Alliance, with Japan and with New Zealand. Argentinaâ??s international cooperation operates through the Argentine Fund for South-South and Triangular Cooperation, which is celebrating its twenty- fifth anniversary this year and is a fundamental foreign policy mechanism that makes it possible for us to align ourselves in solidarity and in a horizontal fashion with other States. We need to update our strategies to create links and relationships with other mid-level developed States. As a reflection of our vocation to enter the regional and international arenas, next March Argentina will be the host of the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation. We hope that that will provide an opportunity for debate and for the building of consensuses that will make it possible for us to achieve a fairer, more equal world. Argentina reaffirms its commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations. We will continue to provide our assistance, especially in Haiti and in Colombia. Argentina promotes its presence on the international stage with the aim of achieving better levels of protection and a sustainable and rational use of our natural resources, and we encourage all projects and all activities that improve the living conditions of the people living on our national territory. Care for the environment is a priority for my Government. Growth cannot take place in a manner that is out of balance with the environment. As Pope Francis warned, the pace of consumption, of waste and of change in the environment has gone beyond the resources of the planet. The environment is a collective good; it is the heritage of all of humankind, and it is everybodyâ??s responsibility. Protecting the environment should be a comprehensive part of the development process. It must not be seen in isolation. Argentina is committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It upholds that commitment and will continue upholding it with other States parties in the preparatory process for the twenty- third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to achieve concrete progress in the implementation of the Convention. We wish to reiterate our legitimate and inalienable right of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. Once again, we call upon the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to renew bilateral negotiations, which will make it possible for us to find a peaceful permanent solution that respects the way of life of the island peoples and that is in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Our Government has begun a new phase in our relations with the United Kingdom. We hope that that will contribute to the creation of conditions in which both Governments can sit at the negotiating table with a view to resolving this protracted sovereignty dispute. Two years ago our Governments met in this Hall to add their voices to a collective commitment, which took the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Taking on in a determined manner the targets and goals set by the 2030 Agenda will allow us to build a better world for coming generations. The progress that we have already made bears witness to the fact that focusing on people, as the Secretary- General requests that we do, is the only way to respond to our task. The phase of history that we are living through is full of challenges and opportunities. I welcome the fact that in every corner of our planet there is a renewed perspective with regard to the vital, distinct contribution that women can and must make, provided that we bring feminine attributes into play. What am I talking about? I am talking about our natural tendency as women to unite in a world where disintegrating forces seem to be gaining strength and prevailing. We have a vocation for long-term vision when everything around us appears to be uncertain. We have the vocation of nourishing, of caring for others, of seeing with empathy, and of putting ourselves in other peopleâ??s shoes. All of those are indispensable feminine qualities that we must put into play if we want a more equal and more just society. Those attributes are indeed vital but, as we know, they are not the exclusive domain of women. Neither are we are the only people needed to reach the goals that we have set. It would be extremely counterproductive to sacrifice the contribution of any gender, tradition, religion or culture on the altar of our prejudices. We need everybody. We must all bear the enormous burden of ensuring that this stage of history will bear fruit in the lifetime of each individual. In that way, without excluding anybody who wants to contribute towards that work, we will achieve a global society that is more prosperous and, above all, more just and fair. Our work must be a work of love because justice and the quest for the common good are the expression of love in the public sphere.",1,196
7707,Session 72 - 2017,ARM_72_2017.txt,ARM_72_2017,72,2017,ARM,"I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajcÃ¡k on his election and wish him success in his duties as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also take this opportunity once again to congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres upon his appointment as Secretary-General. We wish him success in carrying out his important duties. Armenia supports the priorities that Secretary- General Guterres has declared. In 2017, we mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of Armeniaâ??s accession to the United Nations. On 2 March 1992, the Armenian tricolour started flying at United Nations Headquarters, the logical and desired outcome of the Armenian peopleâ??s quest to exercise their fundamental right to self-determination. Over the years, Armenia became a full-fledged, responsible member of the international community. We faced numerous challenges, but we withstood them with dignity. The Nagorno Karabakh conflict was the most important and daunting one. This is the fifth time that I speak from this rostrum, and again I need to address the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. I would have preferred to talk of peace, progress and cooperation but, unfortunately, we are still far from that stage. Hence, it is my duty to explain why we are so far from that desirable point. The new phase of the Artsakh peopleâ??s struggle for self-determination began almost 30 years ago. The Armenians of Artsakh used peaceful calls to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. Azerbaijan has always responded to such calls with the use of force. The policy of the Baku Government culminated in the massacre, ethnic cleansing and mass deportation of the Armenian population of Azerbaijan. Districts with 17-29275 17/27 once-flourishing Armenian populations are now devoid of Armenians, and the Government of Azerbaijan continues with its policy of systematically destroying the vast Armenian cultural and spiritual heritage on the territories under its control. It is obvious that in those circumstances the people of Artsakh have had no other choice than to resort to self-defence. Azerbaijan did not learn any lessons from the perilous war of 1992- 1994, its aftermath and negotiations. Last year in April, Azerbaijan unleashed a four-day war, which proved that Azerbaijanâ??s objective is to exterminate the people of Artsakh. In the course of the military hostilities, the Azerbaijan armed forces committed a number of war crimes against the civilian population and prisoners of war. I find it worth mentioning that one serviceman who committed such atrocities received a high State award, and the President of Azerbaijan personally decorated him in front of the cameras. For years hate speech against Armenians was made part and parcel of the Azerbaijan State policy. It is firmly part of its school curriculums and poisons the upbringing and thinking of its younger generation. For years a number of intergovernmental and other specialized organizations dealing with racism and xenophobia have raised the alarm. All of this leads us to the conclusion that the Artsakh peopleâ??s exercise of the right to self-determination is of vital importance. In that regard, I express the views of Armenia, the Artsakh and of all Armenians all over the globe. I bring this message from Yerevan, where the sixth Armenia diaspora conference is currently taking place. Everyone should be aware that for the Artsakh people, who are building democracy, Azerbaijan simply symbolizes medieval backwardness. Azerbaijan has no legal or moral grounds whatsoever to present any claims on Artsakh. Artsakh has never been part of independent Azerbaijan, and it is not fair to attempt to annex Artsakh to that State order. Today free Artsakh is an established democratic society. Our shared motto and commitment of leaving no one behind should be the hallmark guiding the work of the United Nations family. For that very reason, I believe that the people of Artsakh should never be excluded from the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. I strongly believe that the unresolved status of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict should have no impact on the people of Artsakh as they exercise their rights. It is, first and foremost, about the inalienable rights of any human being, the right to life, to organize public life, to freely form oneâ??s own Government, to communicate unimpededly with the outer world, and about many other rights. Armenia consistently contributes and will contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the Artsakh people and to its sustainable and democratic development. No one has a right to create hindrances to the implementation of initiatives and projects to that effect. The legal status of Artsakh, or, to be more precise, the lack of international legal recognition, is not an impediment to the exercise of the rights of the men and women living there. We strongly believe that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. Right now, from this rostrum, I reiterate our commitment to that effect. Meanwhile, everyone should be aware that the Nagorno Karabakh issue is a human rights issue, one that can be resolved exclusively through one of the fundamental and inalienable human rights â?? the peopleâ??s right to self-determination. At the end of the day, whatever option for resolving the conflict we arrive at, the Republic of Artsakh should not enjoy a status and liberty inferior to the one it enjoys today. Azerbaijan will recognize and respect the right of the people of Artsakh to decide their own future through the free expression of their will. All available international and domestic mechanisms should guarantee the security of the Armenian population of Artsakh. All remaining issues are collateral in nature and will be resolved in a logical and fair manner in conjunction with the general resolution process. When I last spoke from this rostrum and addressed the process of international recognition of the Armenian genocide (see A/71/PV.17), I considered it my duty to express our gratitude to all those nations, one by one, that had recognized the horrendous crime that was committed against my people by the Ottoman Empire. It is my duty to express gratitude here to all those countries that displayed honour and responsibility by recognizing, or reiterating their position on, the Armenian genocide. I thank them for that initiative, regardless of the format and language adopted. I thank the numerous countries and individuals, State bodies, regional entities and organizations that called things by their proper names. That is indeed important, since denial paves the way for new crimes of genocide. In that context, we recall that next year the United Nations 18/27 17-29275 family will mark the seventieth anniversary of the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Armenia will propose a new initiative on that occasion, and we invite everyone to join us and support it. Nevertheless, we have never made recognition of the Armenian genocide a precondition for the normalization of bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey. Moreover, it was at the initiative of Armenia that a normalization process was launched, resulting in the conclusion of the Zurich protocols in October 2009. Those documents have not been ratified thus far; instead they have been left in some dark drawer in Ankara. The Government of Turkey came up with preposterous preconditions for their ratification that run counter to the letter and spirit of the protocols. I expressed the clear-cut views of the Armenian people on that issue three years ago (see A/69/PV.6), when I spoke from this rostrum. Now the time is ripe for additional explanations. The leadership of Turkey is mistaken if it thinks that it can keep those documents hostage forever and ratify them only at the most opportune occasion from its point of view. The protocols were negotiated in the existing circumstances at the time in order to find solutions to the then existing issues. Armenia will declare those two protocols null and void, since there has been no progress towards their implementation. We will enter the spring of 2018 without those, as our experience has demonstrated, futile Protocols. Armenia nevertheless continues to believe that any two neighbouring States need to establish and enjoy normal relations in order to address any possible disagreement between them and find solutions. That is the credo we are guided by in our engagement with various integration processes. Armenia today is an active member of the Eurasian Economic Union and spares no effort in contributing to the unimpeded movement of goods and services in that large economic area. In that way, we promote welfare for all. We have already registered certain achievements in that regard, and that makes us feel hopeful for the future. We also plan to conclude an Armenia-European Union comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement in November, which, in our view, will help give new impetus to the institutional reforms being implemented in Armenia. The current instability in the Middle East regretfully remains as a serious challenge. It is with great pain that we have been following the crisis in Syria and the humanitarian situation there, which has brought about the suffering of the civilian population, including the countryâ??s Armenian community. Armenia is doing what it can to mitigate the suffering of the Syrian people by providing humanitarian assistance. We also express our willingness to engage in possible discussions on the peacemaking efforts in Syria under the United Nations auspices and with an appropriate mandate. I have no doubt that the United Nations family can ensure the needed cooperation to address modern global and regional challenges. It is with that objective in mind that Armenia participates in a number of the United Nations peacekeeping operations. Moreover, we stand ready to increase our contribution in Lebanon and Mali â?? respectively, to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. As a landlocked country with scarce natural resources located in a complex region, Armenia has continuously emphasized that it considers human beings to be its most valuable resource. That is indeed the case both for Armenia and for the whole United Nations family â?? we should focus on people and we should strive for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.",1,196
7708,Session 72 - 2017,ATG_72_2017.txt,ATG_72_2017,72,2017,ATG,"On 6 September, my small, two-island State, Antigua and Barbuda, was the victim of the ferocity of Hurricane Irma, the largest storm endured in the Atlantic in human history. The island of Barbuda was decimated, its entire population left homeless and its buildings reduced to empty shells. Fortunately, Antigua and Barbuda was spared the full blast of Hurricane Maria just nine days later, although sustained winds of up to 60 miles per hour gave us a troubling awareness of the agony visited on the nearby islands of Dominica, Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico. Antigua and Barbuda continued to stay resilient. Having witnessed the devastation of Barbuda and the desolation of its inhabitants after the ravages of Irma, my heart bleeds for the people of the countries that have now been brutalized by Maria, and those that will suffer its cruelty in the coming days. I have come to the General Assembly because I consider it to be important to speak to the worldâ??s representatives and to do so collectively in order to share the experience of my country, as well as the huge challenges faced by the Caribbean islands in general. Barbuda and its inhabitants were among the worst affected by Hurricane Irma in the region. Barbuda has a surface of 62 square miles. When Irma thundered over the island, it was 375 miles wide, with gale force winds of 220 miles per hour. Barbuda did not stand the faintest chance against such size, such ferocity and such intensity. The island was completely destroyed, and my Government was compelled to evacuate all of the inhabitants to Antigua. For the first time in over 300 years, there are now no permanent residents on Barbuda. The footprints of an entire civilization have been erased by the brutality and magnitude of Irma. Everything that meant anything to the inhabitants had to be left behind â?? their homes, their possessions, their history, indeed, everything that defines them as a society and as a people. Mercifully, Antigua, the larger of the two islands, suffered no major damage, and it could begin to function normally within 48 hours. Had that not been the case, how we would have coped is simply beyond imagination. Overnight, Antiguaâ??s population increased by almost 3 per cent. I know of no country that could easily cope with such an unplanned, unexpected and unscheduled increase in its population. In addition to providing shelter, accommodation and basic necessities to the evacuated residents of Barbuda, the social services on Antigua are now under great strain. They struggle to provide school places for an additional 600 students, medical services for the elderly and a means of earning an income for the able-bodied. Naturally, the residents of Barbuda are anxious to return to their homeland. But, as I speak to the Assembly, the island remains unfit for human habitation. There is no electricity or potable water, and 95 per cent of the buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged. Preliminary estimates have placed the cost of rebuilding Barbuda at about $250 million. That figure represents 15 per cent or more of my countryâ??s gross domestic product of approximately $1.5 billion. It is simply a stretch beyond our reach. The President took the Chair. Antigua and Barbuda urgently requires the assistance of the international community, including the international development and finance institutions, to accomplish the vital task of rebuilding Barbuda. And I should say that we have not outstretched the palm of our hand because we simply crave; we plead because we need. Barbuda is not only a natural disaster; it is a humanitarian crisis that now consumes Antigua. Even as my Government and people look forward to the assistance of the better-off nations of the world, I thank those nations and persons who were first responders, particularly the Government and the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who went beyond the call of duty to assist. I also acknowledge the commitment of and contributions from the Government and the people of the Peopleâ??s Republic of China, the Governments of Cuba, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Canada, the Dominican Republic and sister States of the Caribbean Community, who gave generously from the little they have. That includes Dominica, which, in one wretched night, lost a significant number of precious lives and years of hard-earned development under the unrelenting battering of Hurricane Maria. On Antigua, Barbudans are being cared for as best we can with our very limited resources. But as the period of care lengthens, not only do the conditions worsen but the cost also increases, forcing my Government to borrow money on commercial terms at high interest rates and swelling our already burdensome national debt. The present international financial architecture is leaving small States such as mine behind. Whatever position on climate change a nation may take, the evidence of global warming is now irrefutably stronger. Two Category 5 hurricanes within 12 days, which unrelentingly pounded so many countries, can no longer be dismissed as vagaries of the weather, nor can they be explained as Natureâ??s doing. Hurricanes are stronger and bigger because they are absorbing moisture from seas that are increasingly warmer as a result of global warming. And that is a man-made phenomenon, attributable to those nations that consume 80 per cent or more of the worldâ??s primary energy, emitting dangerous levels of pollution into the atmosphere. All 14 Caribbean Community countries together produce less than 0.1 per cent of global emissions. We are the least of the polluters but the largest of the casualties. The unfairness, injustice and inequality of the situation are painfully obvious. If such frequent and brutal storms are to be withstood, Caribbean islands and certain parts of the United States need to construct more resilient buildings and infrastructure than now exists. That means that the international development and financial institutions need to provide financing at concessionary rates without artificial impediments. If that does not happen, the subsequent cost in lives and property is too frightening to contemplate. Increasingly, States such as mine are victims of an international economic and financial system that regards us merely as a numerical statistic or a mere nuisance. We are measured by the level of our income, even though it is an insufficient and unreasonable criterion for establishing vulnerability, poverty and need. Like many other small island States, my developing country is categorized as high-income, thus denying it access to concessional financing and grant funding from international financial institutions and donor Governments. It is patently obvious that the per-capita income criterion is a skewed and flawed determinant. It should be eliminated and eliminated immediately. Because we are small economies with inadequate domestic capital formation, our countries open our doors to foreign investment, granting significant tax concessions so as to attract investments and help provide jobs to curb poverty. The consequence is that a small percentage of persons in our community, mostly expatriates, at the top end of businesses earn the largest percentage of high incomes and the mass of the population earns considerably less. In addition, Government tax revenues are significantly reduced owing to the investment concessions granted. It is time that those who control the levers of power in the economic and financial international community acknowledged that the per-capita system of measurement is discriminatory and resolved to change it. It is time that that particular swamp be drained, and now is the time for action. In the United States, where the United Nations is located and the Assembly is gathered today, one of its early leaders, Abraham Lincoln, declared at a critical time in its history that this country could not survive â??half slave and half freeâ??. He may have been speaking specifically of America and of the disunity that gripped it at the time, but he was talking about more than immorality. He was also talking about social and economic justice. Lincolnâ??s observation is compellingly relevant to social and economic justice in the world today. Injustice and inequality breed instability. The world cannot survive with the wealthy few controlling 90 per cent of global resources. If so, its centre will not hold. Its centre will not hold if the inequality between rich and poor nations increases. It will not be stable until social and economic justice prevails. My country and citizens do not want to beg for a living. We want to work for it. We want to earn our way, but we cannot do so if the international system refuses to provide us with the means and the tools to build our future. Access to concessional financing represents an imperative need that would give us a great leap forward. It would take us out of the spiral of debt that we are incurring owing to our repeated need to rebuild after disasters with high-cost commercial money. Where is the justice in that? In large wealthy countries borrowing occurs in capital markets at 3 per cent per annum while the so-called high-income small island States are forced to borrow commercially at 12 per cent per annum to repeatedly rebuild infrastructure damaged by hurricanes. Where is the justice in that? It is irrational and punitive to graduate a small island State that cannot pay its debts to high-income status, thereby precluding it from much-needed development financing. The theme of the Assemblyâ??s general debate is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. That is all my people and the people of small island States want â?? peace and a decent life on a planet that is sustainable. We deserve nothing less, and we expect nothing less. It is in that connection that I draw attention to the fact that even in the midst of our present crisis, Antigua and Barbuda is faced with demands from a Paris Club group of wealthy countries for the settlement of $130 million in debts incurred four decades ago because concessional financing was and is still denied to us. It would be of enormous help in dealing with the plight that we now face and the daunting task of rebuilding Barbuda at a cost upwards of $250 million if those wealthy Paris Club countries would forgive or at least reduce significantly the debt that now weighs so heavily on our shoulders. It should be noted that the amount outstanding constitutes primarily accrued interest. Such a step would provide us with the fiscal space to borrow as we seek to garner every cent to recover and rebuild from Hurricane Irma and to give our people a chance to achieve a decent life in keeping with the Sustainable Development Goals. In that same context, my small country won a trade dispute with the United States in 2004 before the World Trade Organization. That trade violation led to significant revenue losses to my country and to greater unemployment among my people. It has been 13 long years since that judgement and seven years since the final appeal by the United States resulted in a final ruling in my countryâ??s favour, and yet the United States has failed to settle. The loss of trade revenues to my small country has risen to more than $200 million. Our Government has laboured unsuccessfully for more than 13 years to reach an amicable and reasonable settlement with the United States. That is a classic case where might is right and where the rights of a small, powerless State have been trampled on. I should mention that over the past 13 years the United States has enjoyed a trade surplus with my small country of more than $2 billion â?? I repeat, $2 billion. I am well aware that the prolongation of a settlement of the judgement in question is not the making of the present United States Administration, which inherited it. But in the interest of fairness, justice and good conscience, it would be beneficial to my nation in this hour of great need for the United States Government to settle that case. In this very Hall two days ago, President Trump said of the United States, â??[W]e can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in returnâ?? (A/72/PV.3, p. 11). His observation, which I welcome, is equally true for the relationship with Antigua and Barbuda. Honouring its obligations to Antigua and Barbuda is not a one-sided deal in which the United States gets nothing in return, because ultimately 90 per cent of the settlement proceeds will be spent in the United States economy, as our primary source market. The United States is the greatest beneficiary of trade with my country and has been so year after year for many decades. Settling with us for more than 13 years of trade losses would take less than one year of the trade surplus that the United Statesâ?? $20 trillion economy has with Antigua and Barbudaâ??s mere $1 billion economy. In the past few days the experience of the Caribbean islands has shown that entire ancient communities can be snuffed out overnight and the quality of their life suddenly and irreversibly set back. I remind members that for the first time in more than 300 years there is no permanent human resident on Barbuda. But my Government is determined to rebuild Barbuda, however long it takes and with whatever resources we can muster. We are determined that no Caribbean society will be extinguished and that the Caribbean nations will remain firmly on the global map. But even as we resolve, with limited means, to keep our societies alive and vibrant, we call on the international community to acknowledge its obligation to humankind and all peoples, without whom its own societies cannot prosper and will not thrive. In the words of the poet John Donne, â??Any manâ??s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for theeâ??. As citizens of planet Earth, let us acknowledge our common humanity and work in harmony to make our world a better place.",1,196
7709,Session 72 - 2017,AUS_72_2017.txt,AUS_72_2017,72,2017,AUS,"The United Nations was founded in response to the horrors of the Second World War. Nations resolved to prevent a repeat of that catastrophic global conflict. Over the decades since, we have worked together to build an international rules- based order that ensures that disputes can be resolved peacefully and the interests of less powerful nations can be protected from the overt or coercive pressure of more powerful States. That order dictates how nations should behave towards each other. It has supported and enabled the greatest economic expansion in human history. There have been times over the past seven decades when the rules-based order has been under pressure. We are now in a time when the challenges to that order are increasing. The Security Council is the custodian of international peace and security. Yet the authority of the Council is being challenged, undermined and even ignored. The most egregious example of that is North Korea. The regime of Kim Jong Un is openly defying the Security Council. Its illegal nuclear and missile programmes violate multiple Security Council resolutions. The security of millions of people is at risk as a result of North Koreaâ??s refusal to abide by international laws and norms. The International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty confirms that North Korea is the only State that is currently testing nuclear weapons, and the only State to do so this century. The Security Council has responded with tough new economic sanctions. It is crucial that all Member States, especially the five permanent members, which have a particular responsibility, strictly implement those sanctions so as to compel North Korea to abandon its illegal programmes. The authority of the Council must be defended and upheld. Australia will play its part in helping to resolve that crisis. We have already put in place a range of autonomous sanctions beyond those mandated by the Security Council. We will explore further options should North Korea continue its flagrant disregard of the views of the international community, as upheld by the Security Council. The rules-based order is also being challenged by non-State actors, terrorists and violent extremists. Global terrorism and the extreme Islamist ideologies driving it must be confronted and defeated. Many nations, including Australia, have suffered terrorist attacks. We can most effectively combat and defeat terrorism if we work together, sharing our knowledge and resources. Our work has continued this week at meetings of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the United States-led coalition against Daâ??esh. The use of chemical weapons presents another serious threat to the rules-based order. We know that they were used in Syria. Australia supports the work of the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in identifying those who deployed such appalling illegal weapons. That work must continue. Australia chairs the 42-member Australia Group, which works to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons. Our rules-based order has been supported by institutions and, over the decades, United Nations peacekeepers have become the defining image of the United Nations response to conflict and security threats. Fifteen peacekeeping missions are currently deployed across four continents. Often, they are the only authority preventing civil breakdown and lawlessness in countries that are already suffering from conflict, poverty and despair. Australia has been a long-term supporter of United Nations peacekeeping. Last week in Canberra, we commemorated the seventieth anniversary of the first such mission, noting that, in 1947, Australia was the first nation to deploy into the field military observers to monitor the ceasefire in the then Dutch East Indies. We have contributed to 20 more United Nations peacekeeping missions. We support the work that is under way to ensure that United Nations peacekeepers are better trained, better equipped, more effective and act with greater integrity. Peacekeepers operate in dangerous and unpredictable environments and represent one of the most important global investments in peace and security. Australia welcomes the new Secretary-General, who has committed to reforming the United Nations in order to make it more effective as the defender and upholder of the rules-based order. Australia fully supports Secretary-General Guterres in that endeavour. The United Nations must focus on conflict prevention, as that is more effective than dealing with the tragic consequences of conflict. United Nations management systems must be made more efficient and accountable. There must be more women in senior positions. In order to achieve reform, Secretary-General Guterres needs the full support of Member States. The standing of the United Nations is maximized when we work together for the common good. Recent successes prove that to be true, such as the global Arms Trade Treaty, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals. If we are to meet the challenges of our age, we must be guided by a spirit of cooperation and compromise. Central to our task is achieving sustainable and inclusive development. The United Nations must play a more effective and agile role. The development system of the United Nations should be more focused on sustainable economic development aimed at providing employment opportunities and facilitating partnerships with the private sector. Economic development and security are interlinked. One cannot be achieved without the other. Each country has to find its own model for prosperity and stability. However, there are many lessons to be learned from other nations, and much support is available for nations that are seeking to establish regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to supporting private investment that helps economies to grow and generates employment. Economic resilience can also be undermined by natural and man-made disasters. With the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Declaration and the World Humanitarian Summitâ??s grand bargain, there is a blueprint for global action that addresses the problems that can be addressed only by working together on the challenges we face, which do not respect national borders. That includes climate change, diseases, including malaria, the management of our precious water resources, and modern slavery. It is an unpalatable truth that forced labour, child labour, human trafficking and modern slavery are rampant in the world. Australia has strongly committed to working with the international community to urgently address those egregious crimes. Last month, Australia and Indonesia jointly launched the worldâ??s first regional business-Government partnership aimed at addressing modern slavery, and we have continued our advocacy on that issue with other nations this week. We will end such abhorrent practices. I want to pay tribute to Andrew, Nicola and Grace Forest for starting the Walk Free Foundation and inspiring our work. Australia is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement, and here at the United Nations we have voiced our support, specifically on risk mitigation for coral reefs, which are among the most valuable environments on our planet. They support more biodiversity than almost any other ecosystem, are vital to the worldâ??s fisheries, protect our coastlines and generate significant tourist revenue. Coral reefs sequester four times more carbon than forests and are a vital element in our global efforts to reduce emissions. Worldwide, more than 30 coral reefs are listed as World Heritage Sites, and 29 are under stress. As the custodians of the Great Barrier Reef and with our extensive experience in reef management, we seek to bring our expertise to other locations. We hope to serve on the World Heritage Committee next year. Australia has worked with other countries on each of those issues during the past week. We are mindful that no matter how much we work on building strong, resilient societies, crises will still occur. Australia has been a strong contributor to relief efforts in Iraq and Syria, as well as in South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, where there are significant numbers of displaced people at increasing risk of famine. Australia is also supporting those displaced by conflict in Rakhine state, Myanmar. We are contributing to funding life-saving food for up to 300,000 people. Australia also seeks to serve, for the first time, on the Human Rights Council, starting in 2018. I am grateful for the strong support from so many countries for our candidacy. If elected, we will be a principled and pragmatic member of the Council. Australia would be the first nation from the South-West Pacific on the Council. We will promote an agenda relevant both to our region and to the planet. Empowering women and girls so that they can reach their full potential lifts a countryâ??s productivity and underpins stability. We will support the freedom of expression. The number of journalists and human rights defenders detained, abused or killed each year should be of grave concern to us all. We will support good governance and strong democratic institutions. Similarly, we will promote strong, independent national human rights institutions in order to raise awareness of human rights, address violations and hold to account those responsible for abuses. Australia is proud to be the home of the worldâ??s oldest continuous culture, and we will strive to advance the human rights of indigenous peoples around the globe. Australia reaffirms its commitment to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We will also work with other members to enhance the effectiveness of the Human Rights Council, so that its work can make a meaningful difference to the lives of individuals around the world. The Council must remain relevant to the broader international agenda, while making a contribution to building stable, prosperous and compassionate societies. We all strive for an environment in which countries can grow and prosper and in which individuals can aspire to a life unburdened by the threat of violence, an environment driven by a shared vision of peace, compassion and community. For its part, Australia will work with others to protect an international order that ensures that all States can pursue their interests securely and supports cooperative responses to global challenges. The United Nations can become an even more powerful force for stability in an uncertain world. It can live up to the ideals and universal principles on which it was founded. The people of our world expect the Organization to inspire the best in human nature, and that is our duty.",1,196
7710,Session 72 - 2017,AUT_72_2017.txt,AUT_72_2017,72,2017,AUT,"The world has never felt more insecure, at least not in my lifetime. Three years ago, when I first spoke from this rostrum, I was concerned about three serious challenges. First, violent conflict had returned to Europe with the crisis in and around Ukraine. Secondly, with the success of Daâ??esh in Iraq and Syria, radicalization and extremism sharply increased within our societies. Thirdly, the potential humanitarian consequences of a nuclear explosion became a growing concern. Today we still face a violent conflict in and around Ukraine. Acts of extremism and terrorism continue, and the crisis in North Korea demonstrates that the risk of a nuclear confrontation is higher than the world has seen in a long time. While we have achieved a lot over the past years, there are still too many conflicts around the world â?? conflicts that result in terrible human suffering, such as in Syria, South Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen or Libya. There are also new sources of instability, such as in Venezuela or in Myanmar. On a global level, poverty, hunger and climate change, as well as organized crime and the proliferation of weapons remain key concerns. What really worries me is that we seem to have lost trust in the ability of States and institutions to solve these challenges. As current Chair-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I can see this on a regular basis. This is a dangerous development because there is no alternative to international cooperation. We need only took at terrorism. Terrorist organizations, such as Daâ??esh, work on a global scale. More than 25,000 persons die each year in terrorist attacks all over the world and almost all of them are the result of extreme radicalization. This is why, as OSCE Chair, the fight against radicalization is a priority for us. We are working on concrete recommendations for OSCE States on how to better prevent and stop radical groups from misleading our citizens. What we need to do is to destroy these radical groups militarily where they operate, such as in Syria and Iraq, but we also have to be clear that after our military success, more foreign terrorist fighters will return to our societies. That is why, at the same time, we also have to continue the fight within our own societies. We have to take more action to stop radicals with police measures and prevent our youth from being misled by these terrorists. The migration crisis is another global problem and source of instability. Over 60 million people are on the move worldwide. No country can manage this crisis on its own. If we look at demographics, we know that we have to act now. In the next 30 years, the world population will grow from 7.5 to about 10 billion people. Africaâ??s population alone will double from 1.2 to 2.5 billion people. Recent years have shown how difficult such a massive migration movement can become. Over 1 million people have come to Europe via smugglers and thousands died in the Mediterranean Sea. We need to stop this. Uncontrolled migration leads to chaos. Therefore, we need to manage orderly migration and support people as much as possible in their countries of origin. In order to achieve this, we should address three key issues. First, countries need to effectively control their borders. Without such control, no Government can establish security and maintain public support for legal immigration. Citizens need to have confidence that their Governments â?? not the smugglers â?? decide who should cross the border. Secondly, the business model of traffickers of human beings must be destroyed. Securing the borders is the most important first step. Smugglers cannot sell their tickets to Europe when there is no way to come through. People that are saved shall be brought back to their countries of origin or to internationally monitored migration centres in their region. Thirdly, we need effective support for countries of origin to establish a local perspective for the young generation there. This is why, over the past four years, Austria has doubled its bilateral development assistance and quadrupled its emergency fund. I am pleased that the United Nations is developing a global compact on migration, as well as a compact on refugees. They should ensure a more coordinated international approach to deal with these challenges. Cooperation is also key when we address crises and conflicts around the globe. The crisis in and around Ukraine has lasted for far too long. More than 10,000 people have died and 3.8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid. Despite the Minsk agreements, heavy weapons continue to move into the region and mines are being laid; despite negotiations with the Normandy group, the political process is stalled; and despite regular meetings of the Trilateral Contact Group, there is no progress on the ground. The worst thing is that civilians suffer the most. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission is key to stabilizing the situation, but its unarmed monitors are increasingly threatened and, for the first time, the Mission lost one of its members. Yet, despite this tragic incident, it is important to maintain the Mission. From my visit to the conflict zone, I know that without the OSCE Monitoring Mission, the situation would become even worse. Therefore, in March this year, the OSCE strengthened the Mission by increasing the number of monitors up to 1,000 and by providing better technical equipment. I also welcome the discussions in the Security Council to increase the security situation of the OSCE monitors, possibly with a United Nations peacekeeping operation. More safety for monitors means more monitors on the ground, and more monitors on the ground means more security for the local population. We are also working hard to find political solutions that extend beyond ceasefires. The goal remains clear â?? a free and stable Ukraine with good relations with both its western and eastern neighbours. Allow me to turn to another security threat that we must deal with. The risk of nuclear confrontation today is bigger than it has been in a long time. The consequences of a nuclear explosion are extremely grave, nuclear disarmament remains the number- one unfinished business worldwide, and the recent escalation of tensions by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is a clear warning signal. Austria has been consistently engaged in efforts to reduce the risk of a nuclear disaster and to work for a world without nuclear weapons. This is a hard and long road, and we are not naive about that, but it is a goal that is worth fighting for. In that regard, we welcomed the Vienna agreement that placed Iranâ??s nuclear activities under international monitoring. Undermining that agreement now would weaken efforts to achieve negotiated solutions for nuclear disputes. The new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is an important achievementin this connection. It is a crucial, positive step to get rid of all nuclear weapons. Today we often hear that nuclear weapons are necessary for security. This narrative is not only wrong, it is also dangerous. The new Treaty provides a real alternative: a world without nuclear weapons, where everyone is safer. The overwhelming support of the international community in adopting the Treaty demonstrates that many countries share that goal. I hope that we will be successful with our initiative. At a time when universal values are under threat, we need to be strong in standing up for human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Protecting civilians and human rights has always been a priority of Austriaâ??s foreign policy. That is why we hope to be elected to the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021, and I would like to ask the Assembly for its support. I can assure members that Austria will continue to work for effective international cooperation, and we will continue to actively support the United Nations and its new Secretary-General.",1,196
7711,Session 72 - 2017,AZE_72_2017.txt,AZE_72_2017,72,2017,AZE,"For more than 25 years, Armenia has occupied 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan â?? Nagorno Karabakh and seven other regions of our country. Nagorno Karabakh is an ancient and historical part of Azerbaijan. As a result of Armenian aggression, almost 20 per cent of the internationally recognized territory of Azerbaijan is under Armenian occupation. More than 1 million of Azerbaijanis have become refugees and internally displaced persons. Armenia has conducted a policy of ethnic cleansing against Azerbaijanis in Armenia, in Nagorno Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan. Armenia committed genocide against Azerbaijanis in Khojaly. The Khojaly genocide is already officially recognized by more than 10 countries. On February 26, 1992, Armenia committed war crimes, killing 613 peaceful residents of Khojaly, among them 106 women and 63 children. One of those war criminals who committed that terrible crime against humanity is the current Armenian President. Leading international organizations adopted resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan. In 1993, the Security Council adopted resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993), and 884 (1993), demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan. Other international organizations, such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, adopted similar decisions and resolutions. Armenia does not implement them. For 24 years, Armenia has ignored Security Council resolutions, and unfortunately it has not been punished for that. In some cases, Security Council resolutions are implemented within days. In our case, resolutions have gone unimplemented for 24 years. That is a demonstration of double standards, and it is unacceptable. International sanctions must be imposed on Armenia. A major United Nations reform should be the creation of a mechanism for implementing Security Council resolutions. Armenia does everything in its power to maintain the status quo and block substantive negotiations. The co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group â?? France, Russia and the United States â?? have stated on several occasions that the status quo is unacceptable. How can such a corrupt, failed State, ruled by a despotic, medieval regime, violate international law for so many years and ignore Security Council resolutions and statements by the worldâ??s leading countries? Because there is a double standard. There is no international pressure on the aggressor, no international sanctions imposed on the Armenian dictatorship. That policy must end. It is not only a demonstration of injustice, it also creates the impression that the Armenian dictatorship can continue its policy of terror. In April 2016, Armenia committed another war crime on the line of contact, attacking our cities and villages. In that attack, six Azerbaijani civilians were killed, among them one child, and 26 were wounded. Hundreds of our houses were destroyed. Azerbaijan had to defend its citizens. Through a successful counter- attack, Azerbaijan liberated some territories in the three occupied areas â?? Agdere, Fuzuli and Jabrayil â?? and installed its national flag in the liberated territories. The Armenian leadership should not forget that lesson, or the results of their next provocation will be more painful for them. When it loses on the battlefield, Armenia resorts to the cruel policy of attacking our cities and villages. On 4 July, Armenia launched a targeted attack on Alkhanli village in Fuzuli district with 82 and 120 millimetre mortars and grenade launchers, killing two civilians, two-year old Zahra Guliyeva and her grandmother. On 7 August, a 13-year-old boy in the Tovuz area, which borders Armenia, was wounded by Armenian soldiers. The international community must stop Armenian fascism and terror. Azerbaijan is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, but at the same time it will defend its citizens, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, if Armenian military provocations continue. If necessary, Azerbaijan will again punish the aggressor, as it did in April 2016. The Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno Karabakh conflict must be resolved on the basis of international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions, and the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan must be completely restored. Despite the enormous difficulties caused by the Armenian occupation, Azerbaijan has developed rapidly and successfully. It is an active member of the United Nations, and in 2011 was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, receiving the votes of 155 countries. An absolute majority of Member States demonstrated their support for Azerbaijan and its policy. For Azerbaijan, which at that time had been independent for only 20 years, that was a great success. Azerbaijan is a stable, modern, democratic country. The development of democracy and the protection of human rights are among the top priorities of our Government. All fundamental freedoms are fully guaranteed in Azerbaijan, including freedom of expression, of the press, of assembly and of religion. Azerbaijan is one of the worldâ??s recognized centres of multiculturalism, which is a State policy in Azerbaijan, where representatives of all ethnic groups and religions live in peace and harmony. In Azerbaijan we declared 2016 a Year of Multiculturalism and 2017 a Year of Islamic Solidarity. Unlike Armenia, which is a mono-ethnic country with almost no national minorities and where xenophobia is a State policy, Azerbaijan is a multi-ethnic country. Our societyâ??s cultural, ethnic and religious diversity is a big asset. In that regard, Armenia, where Islamophobia has reached a peak, has committed many acts of vandalism, destroying all mosques in the occupied territories. Azerbaijan has hosted numerous international events aimed at strengthening interreligious dialogue. Among them are the seventh Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, the World Religious Leaders Summit, the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, on four occasions, and the Baku International Humanitarian Forum, on five occasions, as well as other important events. As a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Council of Europe, in 2008 Azerbaijan launched the Baku Process, which is supported by the United Nations. The main goal of the Baku Process is to strengthen dialogue, partnership and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe. In 2015, Azerbaijan hosted the first European Games, in which 6,000 athletes from 50 countries participated. This year, we hosted the fourth Islamic Solidarity Games, with almost 3,000 athletes from 54 countries, so in the space of two years our capital city of Baku was the venue for both the European and the Islamic Games, in a major contribution to promoting multiculturalism. In a demonstration of Azerbaijanâ??s status as one of the worldâ??s leading sporting countries, the Azerbaijani team came second overall at the first European Games and first at the Islamic Solidarity Games. Further proof of our achievement in this area is the fact that Azerbaijan finished fourteenth overall at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in terms of medals, winning 18 in total. Azerbaijan has made significant progress in social and economic development. Our economy has more than tripled since 2004, and we have created more than 1.6 million jobs, keeping our unemployment level one of the lowest in the world at 5 per cent. We have prioritized poverty reduction; our poverty levels have gone from more than 40 per cent in 2004 to 5 or 6 per cent. Our hard-currency reserves are equal to the countryâ??s gross domestic product (GDP) and our Stateâ??s foreign debt is less than 20 per cent of GDP. In 2009 Azerbaijan was named leading reformer of the world in the World Bankâ??s Doing Business report. The Davos World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report for 2016-2017 ranked Azerbaijan thirty-seventh of 138 countries. In 2015, Azerbaijan received the South-South Award in recognition of its outstanding achievements in implementing the Millennium Development Goals, and since 2010 has been classified as a country with high human development. Our rapid development of our space industry has enabled Azerbaijan to join the worldâ??s space club with Azerspace and Azersky, its two telecommunication and field observation satellites, with a third, Azerspace-2, to be launched soon. Today, Azerbaijan exports intellectual as well as industrial and agricultural products. Our State agency for services and social innovations for citizens, ASAN, is a model for modern public relations and services. With 251 services under one roof, the agencyâ??s absolute transparency and zero tolerance for corruption and bribery has made it attractive to many countries. As a purely Azerbaijani brand in the five years since it was founded, it has provided more than 1.6 million services to 5 million people. The total number of applications is 17 million and the publicâ??s rating of ASAN is 98 per cent. In 2015, in recognition of its contribution to excellence, creativity and simplification of the delivery of public services, ASAN received the United Nations Public Service Award. The main goal of our policies is improving the lives of our citizens. Since 2004, salaries have increased by 5.6 times and pensions 8.2 times. With no foreign financial support, we have built almost 100 new settlements and towns for refugees and internally displaced persons affected by the Armenian occupation. We have thereby improved the living conditions of more than 250,000 people, providing them with new houses and flats and building 152 schools, 59 medical centres, and 60 kindergartens in their towns and settlements. Overall, since 2004 we have built or renovated more than 3,000 schools and 600 hospitals and medical centres. Azerbaijanâ??s literacy levels are close to 100 per cent. Every year more than 5 million people â?? half of the population â?? receive medical check-ups totally financed by the State budget. Azerbaijan plays an important role in the global energy market. As a reliable supplier of oil and gas to international markets, we provide energy security for many countries throughout the world. Today Azerbaijan, together with its international partners, is close to completing the $40 billion Southern Gas Corridor project, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the world. Another important priority of ours is transportation. Situated as it is between Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan is making wise use of its geographical location to become one of Eurasiaâ??s leading transportation hubs. In recent years we have built six international airports and 11,000 kilometres of modern highways and roads. Azerbaijanâ??s 270 vessels make up the biggest trade fleet in the Caspian Sea, and our modern shipbuilding yards are capable of building all types and sizes of ships. We are also modernizing our railroad infrastructure, and most of our territory can now be reached by rail. Next year we will inaugurate an international trade seaport that will be the biggest in the Caspian region. Azerbaijan is making significant investments in East- West and North-South transportation corridors in order to create the shortest possible routes across the country in both directions. In conclusion, I would like to point out that last year we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the restoration of our independence. Azerbaijanâ??s successful development has demonstrated once again that only when a country is free and independent and its destiny is in the hands of its people can it achieve success. The greatest happiness of the people of Azerbaijan is that we live in an independent country conducting independent polices â?? policies based on the national interests of our people.",1,196
7712,Session 72 - 2017,BDI_72_2017.txt,BDI_72_2017,72,2017,BDI,"I have the pleasure of conveying to the Assembly the most fraternal greetings of Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi. He would have liked to be present here, but pressing commitments back home prevented him from making the journey to New York. My delegation wishes to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I take this opportunity to pay a vibrant tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, a worthy son of Fiji, for a job well done. As this is his first session of the General Assembly as head of our Organization, may I also express Burundiâ??s appreciation to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for his commitment to the values of peace, security and development. Patience is a virtue that climate change does not recognize. The devastating effects it has fuelled have permeated virtually all conversations in this venue and ushered in this very session. The names of Irma and Maria, in the meteorological field at least, will forever connote total destruction. I therefore extend our most sincere condolences to the countries and regions of the Caribbean that have been severely affected by these hurricanes. We also express Burundiâ??s solidarity with Mexico, stricken this week by an earthquake. We stand wholeheartedly with all these countries and their peoples. The climatic disturbances of recent times are again sounding the alarm, urging all States to assume their collective duty to combat global warming and to implement without delay the commitments of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We believe that no State may shirk its responsibility to that end, whatever its size, shape or place on the map of the world. We must work together, for we are all in the same boat. If we wish to attain the objective of containing the average temperature rise on the planet below 2Â°C compared to pre-industrial levels and pursue measures to limit temperature increases to 1.5Â°C vis-Ã -vis pre-industrial levels, we need to act today because tomorrow will be too late. In implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Burundi is continuing its path of social inclusion and shared economic growth. It cannot do otherwise, since these two aspects are key pillars of the development policy advocated through Vision 2025. To that end, our country counts on the cooperation of friendly States and other international partners. Unfortunately, the sanctions adopted by the European Union against Burundi are not contributing to the realization of these plans of great importance for the Burundian people, because they deprive the country of necessary resources. Thus, the attainment of the 2030 Agenda and the objectives of the African Union Agenda 2063 is compromised as a result of these sanctions. We also believe that sanctions unilaterally imposed against developing States in general, and in Africa in particular, should be banned from the international system, since they perpetuate historical injustices and violate the sacrosanct principle of equal sovereignty. Like the African Union, Burundi therefore rejects and condemns the sanctions imposed on Burundi and other African countries. In the field of migration, we must work together to find solutions to the root causes of population movements, made up mostly of young people, from countries of the South to the North. We need to ensure conditions of humane migration in order to protect migrants, who contribute to the well-being of the host communities through their multifaceted contributions to economic activity. The apocalyptic scenes in the Mediterranean Sea strike at our consciences as human beings. The reasons for migration must be explained and we must all understand them if we are to find appropriate solutions. It is regrettable that migration is increasingly being met with a resurgence of racism, rejection of the other and, often, even acts of rare violence against migrants. Likewise, racist populism is becoming increasingly prominent and gradually undermining the paradigms on which certain so-called advanced societies have long rested. Migration is sometimes the result of trafficking in human beings. The victims are doubly affected, since in addition to being wrenched from their countries of origin, they are mistreated in the host countries. That is unacceptable. Consequently, we advocate strengthened international cooperation in that area so as to build a more just world. At the political level, our country reiterates, as it has done repeatedly, its position in consonance with the Charter of the United Nations. All States Members of the United Nations are sovereign Powers, and their sovereignty is equal. We call for reining in those States that continue in the twenty-first century to believe that they have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of other States, especially developing countries. We thank the Security Council, which, in the case of Burundi, has reaffirmed respect for its sovereignty in its various resolutions and presidential statements. We can never say it enough â?? Burundi believes that non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty constitute the pillars of a balanced international system under the Charter of the United Nations. Those principles are not negotiable. Today more than ever, Burundi stands ready to defend them at any price. Recently, human rights have become another tool of domination. As a universal concept broadly elaborated upon in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international instruments, human rights have been increasingly exploited by several States that, if not mindful of their actions, will divert the Human Rights Council from the goals entrusted to it by the General Assembly. Some members have become accustomed to obtaining, through the Human Rights Council and other mechanisms established by the latter, resolutions aimed at undermining the peace and security of the States that they wish to harm. The recent report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Burundi (A/HRC/36/54) constitutes the ultimate proof of the Councilâ??s manipulation by certain small groups. Burundi reiterates that it is ready to cooperate with the relevant United Nations bodies, but on the condition that such cooperation be based on clear, fair and predictable foundations that, above all, respect the choices made by the Burundians themselves in the areas of governance and development. With regard to the inter-Burundian dialogue and the external component, only a short time ago the Government of the Republic of Burundi received a visit from the facilitation team to follow up on consultations and resume discussions. Burundiâ??s positions were made known to the facilitation team. We are waiting for the facilitation to call for the next meeting, at which the delegations will have their voices heard. Burundi has asked its refugees to return. Our appeal, which we reiterate here and now, has also been made to neighbouring countries so as to facilitate their repatriation. Today, the repatriation movement continues apace, with the arrival of approximately 1,700 citizens who found refuge in Tanzania and 3,000 returning from Rwanda. They are joining tens of thousands of others who have returned over the past several months, as well as those who would like to return. We thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration for their cooperation in facilitating those return movements. We take this opportunity to ask that unscrupulous Human Rights Council officials end the unsavoury practice of encouraging refugees not to return. At the same time, we call on the United Nations to continue to monitor the situation of Burundian refugees in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, in full compliance with the relevant provisions of the Geneva Conventions. We deplore the shooting that took place a week ago in Kamanyola, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in the deaths of 38 Burundian refugees, at least one officer of the Forces armÃ©es de la RÃ©publique dÃ©mocratique du Congo, and more than 120 wounded. Once again, we invite the refugees to return home. Burundi has joined other States in combating terrorism, with 5,400 troops in Somalia within the framework of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Burundi has been the second-largest troop-contributing country in Somalia for the past 10 years. Burundi is concerned about the continued reduction in support for AMISOM, especially at a time when an important campaign has been planned. The successes of the past several years cannot be sacrificed to self-interest. That would run contrary to the oath taken by all partners, which have repeatedly stated that terrorism is a global threat. In pursuing its contribution to world peace and security, Burundi participates in peacekeeping operations in the brotherly country of the Central African Republic, and its police units are deployed in CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire and Haiti. Burundi believes that the efforts and sacrifices made by others must be rightly acknowledged in all cases. If there is one recurring topic of debate in this Hall, it is that of the reform of the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council. Burundi supports all approaches aimed at fostering a constructive interaction, open to all, between the States Members of our Organization, on the one hand, and the Secretary- General on the other. Burundi supports the structural reform of the United Nations pursuant to the initiative taken at the high-level event on 18 September. It is necessary to consider the necessary reforms with the goal of improving the functioning of organs including the Security Council and the General Assembly. That will bring the bodies concerned in line with the realities of the twenty-first century. It is clear that by dint of pouring new wine into old wineskins, we wind up bursting the latter. We must be firm in our conviction that, 72 years after its establishment, the United Nations is in need of a complete face-lift. Concerning reform of the Security Council in particular, Burundi supports the shared African stance known as the Ezulwini Consensus. It is high time that we correct the injustices of the past and allow the equitable participation of all continents in the governance of international peace and security. With regard to international issues, Burundi welcomes the return of the Kingdom of Morocco to the fold of the African Union so that we can build a strong and prosperous continent together. With regard to Western Sahara, Burundi supports the decisions and resolutions adopted by the relevant United Nations bodies. We call for the unconditional lifting of the economic blockade against Cuba without delay. The Cuban people have suffered under unjust measures that were adopted during the Cold War era for primarily ideological reasons and can no longer be justified today. Similarly, in the case of Venezuela, we call on the international community to take measures that promote national cohesion and not social disruption. Lastly, I wish the General Assembly every success at this session.",1,196
7713,Session 72 - 2017,BEL_72_2017.txt,BEL_72_2017,72,2017,BEL,"At the outset, I would like to express our support to the victims of the recent hurricanes as well as those of the earthquakes in Mexico. Such natural disasters brutally destroy lives and dreams and bring about instability and insecurity. Above all, however, such tragedies are akin to a warning shot. They remind us of the utter urgency of the need to work together against global warming. In that regard, I would like to welcome and support the initiative undertaken by French President Emmanuel Macron in the wake of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change aimed at establishing a genuine and far-reaching compact for the environment. Unquestionably, we can no longer postpone what we need to do today. For many countries, in particular the island States in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, such natural phenomena have an immediate impact on their survival. We must bequeath our children a planet where they can live and breathe, enriched by biological diversity. Let us use the best of our intelligence and our ability to innovate in order to rise to that existential challenge. We all want a better world. We want to fight relentlessly against all forms of injustice, inequality and discrimination, whether on the basis of skin colour, religion, gender, culture of sexual orientation. And we all want to advance universal fundamental freedoms. When we want the best for our countries and for our fellow citizens, there can be no question of the importance of the freedom of the press and of expression. All too often, elections are manipulated, justice is undermined, corruption is widespread and there is a purposeful lack of transparency. Both national and international institutions must guarantee personal freedoms and work constantly to achieve emancipation and greater dignity for all. Of course, sovereignty must be fully respected, but it cannot be used as a shield or an excuse for attempting to legitimize atrocities or force submission. This is not a lecture on morals or about dictating, by will or force, a ready-made model democracy. This is about convincing others, through steady and constant dialogue, of the need to unreservedly defend our universal values on behalf of each and every human being, no matter where they are from or where they are going. Diplomatic ruptures have never helped to advance universal values, and abandoning dialogue is often an act of cowardice that also abandons those fighting for greater freedom in their country. We all want a safer world. Peace, security and stability are the best ways to guarantee that we can all live our lives to the full, having enough to eat, having work, having a home and being able to send our children to school. Yet still today there are too many conflicts, wars and hatred tearing hopes and dreams apart. No continent is spared the scourge of terrorism. Fomenting hatred and spreading the poison of division is the grim goal of terrorists, whose senseless, barbaric acts of murder destroy familiesâ?? futures. None of us can remain indifferent to that, and my country is therefore participating, with others, in the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh. Military forces on the ground have forced Daâ??esh to retreat in Iraq and Syria, and we are committed to supporting the countries that have been destroyed in their efforts to rebuild. But we must always continue the fight to protect our universal values of freedom, tolerance, respect and non-discrimination. Our desire to live together in harmony despite our differences and with respect for each otherâ??s cultures and customs must prevail. In that regard, I would like to recall the wise and ever- pertinent words of Gandhi, who said that if we answer hatred with hatred, we only spread it. Another threat to world security is the uncontrolled proliferation of arms, particularly nuclear weapons. While the world is in turmoil and there are numerous conflict zones, the most lasting and mutually beneficial solutions will always be political and diplomatic in nature rather than military. The agreement concluded after several years of intense negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue must be safeguarded and implemented. My country has many major differences with Iran but the agreement is nonetheless a channel for dialogue aimed at reducing tensions and threats. It is an opportunity to agree on our goals and deal with our differences peacefully. Rejecting it without proposing any alternative seems neither wise nor desirable. The situation in North Korea is also enlightening on this issue. In contrast to the situation with Iran, here there was no continuous process of dialogue and negotiation. The result has been a dangerous escalation that is jeopardizing peace and security. We condemn the countryâ??s autocratic and provocative regime, but merely condemning it is not enough. We should all mobilize in order to prepare the ground for dialogue, including invoking the responsibility borne by such actors as China and Russia. Economic development must serve social cohesion. Growth rates, even in double figures, are not necessarily a guarantee of the fair and equitable distribution of wealth. Capitalism is a means, nothing more or less, for serving social and economic development. We support free trade and we want an open global economy. The free flow of goods, services and knowledge should promote shared development and progress. Sustainable development is not possible without development, and we cannot eradicate poverty without increasing prosperity. Free enterprise must be geared to the true economy, the production of good and services and job creation. We must strengthen the middle classes everywhere. This is not about the survival of the fittest or having the law of jungle imposed on us. It is about distinguishing between investment and speculation. Investment, as opposed to financial speculation, is a responsible and virtuous activity that benefits society as a whole and stimulates innovation and progress. Throughout history, freedom of movement and free trade have brought people closer together. Those principles have been at the heart of the European project for 60 years. The European Union negotiates treaties with various partners all over the world, including Canada and Japan. Those treaties include social and environmental provisions. That openness to the world, accompanied by rules and regulations, is the most concrete response we can make to isolationism and protectionism. History has shown us, time and again, that barriers and walls between peoples are illusory â?? they always give way to our natural thirst for freedom, openness and innovation. The 2030 Agenda defines an ambitious framework for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting private initiative, strengthening the rule of law, encouraging education for boys and girls alike, developing agriculture and building on good governance. Those actions constitute the best recipe for preventing conflict and creating a better, fairer and stronger world. Countries in the South as well as the North are all concerned with the issue of migration. Belgium is a land that welcomes people seeking asylum and fleeing wars and persecution. And we will fight the faithless and lawless traffickers who put women and children in makeshift boats to embark on a journey towards an all too often tragic outcome. We must be on the side of those who suffer. Development in the countries of origin is the key. We must invest in the least developed countries. We remain firmly committed to concluding a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration by 2018. We advocate for a comprehensive approach that facilitates legal migration and enables people to return to their countries of origin, while ensuring their individual security. Multilateralism is a robust and reliable engine for building a better world. Coordination and consensus-building are required. However, the essence of the United Nations is sometimes called into question. Globalization generates doubts and fears. Yet multilateralism does not cause such disruptions; on the contrary, it is frequently the best solution to them. We must respect our independence, but at the same time we must also recognize our interdependence and uphold the virtues of concerted action. We must work tirelessly to build a consensus in which all nations, large and small, have their roles to play and, in that way, have a say. Belgium is fully behind the Secretary-Generalâ??s vision for reforming the Organization, not because reform is an end in itself, but because the world today demands more determined and results-oriented action. Multilateralism is a complex task, with occasional obstacles and frequent frustrations. However, there are also successes of which we speak too little. In Colombia, for example, concerted action has put an end to one of the longest conflicts in the world. Multilateralism also requires a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable approach. Prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding must be seen as part of a continuum. International and regional consultation must also be strengthened. As we know, when regional actors and the United Nations are aligned and working together in the same direction, great things can happen. In the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, the countries of the region have a decisive role to play. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the security situation has deteriorated considerably and the humanitarian crisis is worrying. But even as the debate on the cost of peacekeeping operations has begun, we cannot abandon the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On the contrary, we must support it so that it can anchor itself in an irreversible democratic process, including by holding honest, transparent and inclusive elections. The destinies of Africa and Europe have always been linked. Challenges to one are challenges to the other, whether we are talking about security, migration or even development. We must work to achieve a less complicated relationship, liberated from the demons of the past and functioning on a peer-to-peer level, while we look to the future. In the Middle East, we continue to advocate for a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine. As far as Syria is concerned, that endless conflict can end only when the international community as a whole shows its political will and develops a genuine common strategy. Combating impunity and strengthening international justice are at the heart of Belgiumâ??s priorities, and we will continue to work for them An example of such efforts is the amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We want to encourage cooperation among States in order to combat impunity for the most serious international crimes. In that regard, we call on all States that have not yet done so to support an initiative to launch the negotiation of a new treaty on mutual assistance and extradition. Our shared goal for the United Nations must be working every day to build an efficient Organization that serves the common interests of the Member States. The key to success lies in the art of compromise and the ability listen actively â?? and in having the strength of conviction to bring that about. My countryâ??s transparent and constructive attitude is reaping results that benefit everyone. Belgium is a land of compromise. It is in that spirit that we are currently a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council. Based on our international roots and experience, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of building consensus and acting for peace. As the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, man can make his happiness only by working for that of others. We stand ready to get to work.",1,196
7714,Session 72 - 2017,BEN_72_2017.txt,BEN_72_2017,72,2017,BEN,"I would like to deliver the following message on behalf of Mr. Patrice Talon, President, Head of State and Head of Government of the Republic of Benin. â??At the outset, I would like to reiterate my warm congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to assure him of my countryâ??s support in the fulfilment of his mandate. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his efforts. I would like to once again warmly congratulate Secretary- General AntÃ³nio Guterres and assure him of our full support and, lastly, to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. â??I extend my condolences and my sympathies to the Governments and the peoples of the United States, France, Mexico and Sierra Leone and all the countries in the Caribbean that have been victims of recent natural disasters. â??As we move into the active phase of concrete implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, Benin welcomes the theme of this session of the Assembly, entitled â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. This theme corresponds closely to the guidelines in our Governmentâ??s programme of action, which places humankind and the planet at the centre of its concerns. Benin, as members know, is continuing its efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals through courageous and necessary reforms. â??On 22 September 2016, from this rostrum, I affirmed that mass poverty is a major threat to humankind, and on that occasion I expressed the hope that the determination that led the world to adopt the Paris Agreement on Climate Change could lead us to set up a comprehensive programme for the eradication of mass poverty. A year later, that appeal is more relevant than ever, as the situation in our countries continues to deteriorate. Thousands of people are forced to emigrate, in most cases at risk to their lives, with, as a corollary, many security and economic challenges for host countries, as well as significant environmental consequences. That is why I find this theme useful for the sharing of efforts to ensure sustainable human development and the promotion of a world that respects the environment. â??Benin has committed to addressing youth unemployment as a means of eradicating poverty. In accordance with the road map of the African Union adopted by the Heads of State and Government in January 2016, the Government of Benin, in liaison with the United Nations, has drawn up a national road map to take into account the demographic dividend in Benin. The Governmentâ??s programme of action outlines a number of projects that, when realized, will strengthen sustainable human development. â??The programme, known as Insurance for Strengthening Human Capital, fits into that dynamic. Its operationalization will make health insurance compulsory for all who live in Benin and will make it possible to establish a social protection system for the poorest and most vulnerable. Our programme of action also attaches great importance to the preservation of the environment, and important environmental protection measures are included. â??I believe it is important to take this opportunity to recall Beninâ??s proposal on 15 November 2016 â?? during the solemn high-level session of the twenty-second meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Marrakech, Morocco â?? to establish an international research centre to respond effectively to the effects of climate change on agriculture in Africa, in conjunction with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, based in Nigeria. Our hope is that the appropriate United Nations bodies will consider the implications of that proposal, which would make it possible to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture in Africa. â??We are deeply committed to efforts to combat climate change, and we believe that the Paris Agreement is an indispensable tool for achieving that. In that regard, my country supports the various initiatives, particularly those of France, aimed at getting the United Nations to put in place a third generation of fundamental rights that would be embodied in a global pact for the environment. â??Our session opens at a time when the world is facing a multitude of complex challenges. For decades the world has also seemed prone to crisis and in search of meaning. In many parts of the world, peace is seriously threatened and the values of freedom and the rule of law are compromised. Violent extremism and radicalism weigh heavily on international security and stability. â??The assault on multilateralism, and therefore on the United Nations, is part of that pernicious trend that we must reject. That is why, in order to ensure the well-being of African populations and to address those problems effectively, the African Union needs reform more than ever. Benin strongly supports the ongoing reform process and very much wants it to be finalized as soon as ossible. â??Reform of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, must also proceed so as to increase the effectiveness of the Organization, particularly in the area of peace and security. The composition of the Security Council must be revised in order to take into account the changes that have taken place on the international scene in recent decades. We cannot call for respect for democracy in all countries and, paradoxically, not want it to be applied in reforming the Security Council. That reform, we hope, will make it possible to redress the injustice done to Africa, the only continent not represented in the category of permanent members of the Council. Beninâ??s position on this issue is consistent with that of Africa, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations, and more specifically the Security Council, also needs a fresh start. â??The important challenges to be met include the settlement of the Palestinian question. The creation of a Palestinian State as a full Member of the United Nations living in harmony with Israel will undoubtedly result in a dynamic that can reduce tensions in that region. We therefore support the efforts of the United Nations to achieve that goal, as well as the initiatives to meet the conditions likely to promote an international conference on the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of nuclear weapons. â??I would like to reiterate our commitment to strengthening our contribution to the work of the United Nations and to further working towards the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. The signing in Cotonou on 8 February of the agreement on the status of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali fits into that dynamic. â??I do not wish to end my statement without once again affirming the deep attachment of my country, Benin, to the United Nations, which remains a unique framework for expression, dialogue and action, enabling us to cope in a unified manner with the immense and complex challenges of our globalized world. Multilateralism is an ethical and political imperative for peace. Benin will continue to work alongside all other peoples to build a more just, inclusive and fraternal world order.â??",1,196
7715,Session 72 - 2017,BFA_72_2017.txt,BFA_72_2017,72,2017,BFA,"The seventy- second session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the worldâ??s ability to make progress faces continued significant challenges. The maintenance of international peace and security, the fight against terrorism and extremism, the eradication of poverty, and the achievement of sustainable development and a fairer and more humane international order are our main concerns today. They test us unremittingly, and we have an urgent and pressing duty to provide rapid and sustainable solutions. My delegation and I congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his well-deserved election, and I would like to assure him of our full cooperation in his successful conduct of his work. I also thank his predecessor for his effective execution of his mandate. I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres who, during his first few months at the head of our Organization, has demonstrated his fully committment to peace and development and his resolve to pursue the ambitious goal of revitalizing the United Nations. Two years ago we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to give a new global momentum to peace, prosperity, development, justice and humanism. The entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was welcome in that regard. The establishment of a follow-up and review mechanism for the implementation of the SDGs, as well as the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development to monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are also real achievements. Despite those successes, obstacles remain on the path to building a world of peace and prosperity. I would therefore stress the importance of our theme this session, which restores the human individual to the heart of our global development and governance policies. We cannot forget that every day in Africa, in my country and in others, men and women are dying because of a lack of care or food, children are not enjoying the fundamental right to education, young people are reduced to facing the rage of the seas and oceans to seek a better future, and entire populations are condemned to wander endlessly as victims of conflicts and disaster, all against the backdrop of an international context overshadowed by terrorism and extreme violence. Obviously, it is now more important than ever to change our paradigms, in our conduct of both domestic and international affairs, in order to move from rhetoric to action and a results-based approach. The success of the round table of public and private donors to our national plan for economic and social development, following the appeal that I made at this forum on 22 September 2016 (see A/71/PV.15), speaks to our partnersâ?? confidence in my country. I would like to take this opportunity to offer them our deep gratitude. Burkina Faso is engaged in a process of economic recovery through major structural reforms, and one of the objectives is to attract, facilitate and secure investments. With a view to strengthening our participatory democracy by putting citizens in charge of the functioning of the State, Burkina Faso joined the Partnership for an Open Government in 2016. In that context, we are drawing up our first national action plan to strengthen the fight against corruption and improve our quality of governance, in a spirit of cooperation with non-State actors, civil-society organizations and the media. At the same time, an array of reforms aimed at strengthening our democracy and optimizing our institutions is moving ahead smoothly. A preliminary draft constitution has been prepared by representatives of every sector of society, and the judiciary is working independently to resolve the political and economic disputes and crimes that have plagued our national reconciliation efforts for decades. Targeted for some time by terrorist and obscurantist forces, my country is fully aware of their clearly stated intention to destabilize it and all the countries of the region. The fight against terrorism is therefore a national priority, and will succeed if it is part not only of a subregional approach but also in a context of economic development in the most vulnerable areas. We are therefore paying particular attention to the north of our country. While there have been some operational successes there, we must bolster them through the emergency investment programme that we recently adopted as a way to reduce the vulnerability of populations, especially young people and women. However â?? and we cannot reiterate this enough â?? terrorism is above all a global scourge. Given that it strikes without discrimination, it calls for a clear and firm condemnation from all of us and an effective collective response based on solidarity and shared efforts and means. That is the raison dâ??Ãªtre of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), whose operationalization we are working to accelerate, as the inauguration on 10 September in SÃ©varÃ©, Mali, of the G-5 Sahel Force Command Centre demonstrated. I also welcomed the Security Councilâ??s adoption of resolution 2359 (2017) on 21 June. However, given the gravity of the situation in the area, we must seize the opportunity offered by the consideration of the Secretary-Generalâ??s forthcoming follow-up report to strengthen the mandate of the Multinational Joint Task Force by providing it with the means necessary to achieve its mission. Similarly, we welcome the establishment of the Sahel Alliance, whose first high- level meeting is scheduled for October. One of the major challenges in that regard remains the mobilization of resources, as we stressed at the high-level meeting held on 18 September here in New York, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, on the situation in the Sahel. We hope that the international planning conference provided for in resolution 2359 (2017), to be held in Brussels in December, will fulfil all its promises. The quest for peace must remain at the heart of our common action, especially that of our Organization. In Africa, many hotbeds of tension persist. While we welcome the recent political developments in Mali, it should be noted that the security situation in the north of that country remains highly precarious. I hope that the establishment of a sanctions regime by the Security Council on 5 September, at the request of the Government of Mali, will be an effective additional lever for the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. We invite all the forces present in Mali â?? including the National Armed Forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, Operation Barkhane and the G-5 Sahel force â?? to work in good faith and in full coordination in order to expedite the definitive return of peace and security to the region. Mr. Rabary-Njaka (Madagascar), Vice-President, took the Chair. We must remain mobilized to bring to a successful conclusion the processes of conflict resolution or exit from the crises in Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Somalia, South Sudan and Burundi. We call on the various protagonists to promote dialogue and reconciliation, and to recognize that they will be the primary owners and architects of peace in their countries. Concerning the question of Western Sahara, Burkina Faso reiterates its call for dialogue and negotiation, in a spirit of compromise, with a view to achieving a political and realistic settlement of the dispute. The Palestinian issue continues to be a major concern. I welcomed the holding in January of the Paris Conference, which reaffirmed a solution whereby two States, Israel and Palestine, should live side by side in peace and within secure and internationally recognized borders. The commitment of both parties is the only way to end the conflict and achieve a peaceful and definitive settlement. The efforts of the international community in Iraq, Syria and Yemen must be intensified if we do not wish to see that part of the world sink into perpetual chaos. Burkina Faso is also concerned about the situation in the Gulf Cooperation Council. It urges the protagonists to give priority to dialogue and negotiation in order to end to that crisis. Burkina Faso condemns North Koreaâ??s nuclear tests, which pose a threat to the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world. We urge that country to respect the resolutions of the Security Council, and hope that the logic of dialogue and negotiation will prevail over that of escalation and confrontation. In that context, I reaffirm my countryâ??s commitment to general and complete disarmament and its support for the efforts of the United Nations to that end, in relation both to weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. In that regard, I urge all countries, especially those whose ratification is required, to prioritize the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty as soon as possible. The adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons on 7 July should give further impetus to that effort. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses one of the main threats to international peace and security. My country, which actively participated in the development of the Arms Trade Treaty, is convinced that its implementation will help to eradicate that scourge, which is a genuine obstacle to the development of our States. Multilateralism is the tool par excellence of dialogue and solidarity among peoples. In that regard, the international community would certainly benefit from the Republic of China on Taiwanâ??s effective and broader participation in the specialized agencies and mechanisms of the United Nations system. In the name of that same dialogue and solidarity, which characterize peaceful relations among the actors on the international stage, Burkina Faso is in favour of the total lifting of the embargo on Cuba so that Havana and Washington, D.C., can maintain mutually beneficial partnership relations. United Nations reform remains a central issue for the worldâ??s governing body. We must approach it with the courage and serenity that seeing justice done for Africa requires, particularly with regard to its representation on the Security Council. That accords with the African Common Position and our Organizationâ??s necessary adaptation to a changing world. At a time of such uncertainty and upheaval, we must shoulder our responsibility to give our citizens reason to believe that a better future lies ahead and that we can bequeath a safer world to the next generation. The United Nations is the best instrument we have for that. Let us all commit here and now to making the United Nations stronger, more modern and more efficient. In that regard, we know that we can count on the Secretary-Generalâ??s commitment and determination. I firmly believe that he will play his part in implementing bold reforms so that the United Nations can be a genuine Organization of the people.",1,196
7716,Session 72 - 2017,BGD_72_2017.txt,BGD_72_2017,72,2017,BGD,"Mr. President, let me extend my heartiest felicitations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. My delegation assures you of our full support in discharging your priorities on people, peace and planet. This is the fourteenth time I address the General Assembly, and this time I have come here with a heavy heart. I have come here just after seeing the hungry, distressed and hopeless Rohingya from Myanmar who have taken shelter in Coxâ??s Bazar, Bangladesh. This forcibly displaced people of Myanmar are fleeing an ethnic cleansing in their own country, where they have been living for centuries. I can feel their pain because I and my younger sister were refugees for six years after my father, the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and almost all members of my family were assassinated in 1975. In 1974, in Bangladeshâ??s first-ever address to the General Assembly, my father said, â??I know that the souls of our martyrs join us in pledging that the Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realizedâ??. We are currently sheltering more than 800,000 forcibly displaced Rohingya from Myanmar. The ongoing atrocities and human rights violations in the Rakhine state of Myanmar have once again aggravated the situation at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from Rakhine state are entering Bangladesh to flee violence. As estimated by the International Organization for Migration, in the past three weeks alone, over 430,000 Rohingya entered Bangladesh. We are horrified to see that the Myanmar authorities are laying landmines along their stretch of the border to prevent the Rohingya from returning to their country. This people must be able to return to their homeland in safety, security and dignity. At the same time, I also condemn every kind of terrorism and violent extremism. Our Government maintains a zero-tolerance policy in this regard. I thank the Secretary-General and members of the Security Council for their proactive attempts to stop the atrocities and bring peace and stability to Rakhine state in Myanmar. I further call on the United Nations and the international community to take immediate and effective measures in order to achieve a permanent solution to this protracted Rohingya crisis. In this regard, I propose the following actions. First, Myanmar must unconditionally, immediately and permanently stop the violence and the practice of ethnic cleansing in Rakhine state. Secondly, the Secretary-General should immediately send a fact-finding mission to Myanmar. Thirdly, all civilians irrespective of religion and ethnicity must be protected in Myanmar. To that end, safe zones could be created inside Myanmar under United Nations supervision. Fourthly, the sustainable return of all forcibly displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh to their homes in Myanmar must be ensured. Fifthly, the recommendations of the Kofi Annan Foundation Advisory Commission report must be immediately and unconditionally implemented in their entirety. In the 1971 war of liberation against Pakistan, we endured an extreme form of genocide. In the nine-month war, some 3 million innocent people were killed and more than 200,000 women violated. The Pakistani military launched the heinous Operation Searchlight on 25 March, marking the start of the 1971 genocide. This genocide involved the targeted elimination of individuals on the grounds of religion, race and political belief. Intellectuals were brutally killed. To pay homage to the victims of the genocide, our national parliament recently declared 25 March Genocide Day. In Bangladesh, we have already undertaken the daunting task of bringing the key perpetrators to justice through the International Crimes Tribunal. I urge the international community to take collective action to prevent the recurrence of such heinous crimes as these anywhere anytime. I believe that acknowledging past tragedies such as the 1971 genocide could guide us to achieving â??never againâ??. Since our birth as a nation, we have pursued peace-centric domestic and foreign policies. In that spirit, Bangladesh has taken the lead in introducing the resolution on a culture of peace every year in the General Assembly since 2000. We reaffirm the call for a resumption of the Middle East peace process and for ending all forms of hostilities and discrimination against the brotherly Palestinian people. In recognition of the potential role of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, we look forward to receiving bold and innovative proposals from the Secretary-General on financing for sustaining peace. I am pleased to announce a contribution of $100,000 from Bangladesh for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. As a major troop- and police-contributing country, Bangladesh underscores the importance of upholding the effectiveness and credibility of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We shall maintain our own capability readiness, remain open to further smart pledges, enhance the scope of our peacekeeping training and deploy more female peacekeepers. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to any allegation of sexual exploitation and abuse. As an endorser of the Voluntary Compact on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, I am committed to the Secretary-Generalâ??s Circle of Leadership to combat this scourge. I am also pleased to announce a contribution of $100,000 to the Victim Support Fund established for this purpose. Terrorism and violent extremism have become a major threat to peace, stability and development. Terrorists have no religion, belief or race. Having been the target of a number of terrorist attacks myself, I personally empathize with the victims of terrorism and appreciate their need for protection. We denounce the use of religion to justify violent extremism. I have involved families, women, young people, the media and religious leaders at the community level to offset the spread of violent extremism. In this regard, I reiterate my calls, first, for stopping the supply of arms to terrorists; secondly, for preventing terrorist financing; and, thirdly, for the peaceful settlement of all international disputes. I also urge the United Nations to address the growing threats emanating from cyberspace in order to prevent money- laundering, terrorist financing and other transnational organized crimes. We believe in promoting safe, orderly and regular migration. Last year, we proposed developing a sound migration governance framework through the global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration. I am pleased that the United Nations is delivering on the formation of the compact for migration and refugees. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change remains our bastion of hope for climate justice. By recognizing climate vulnerability, we are building resilience against the grave impacts of climate change. We believe in the potential of the blue economy in advancing the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and seas. Bangladesh has achieved exemplary success in building resilience against flood and other disasters. Crop intensification and the invention of water-resistant crops have helped us achieve self-sufficiency in food. We have efficiently responded to the massive flood that struck the entire South Asian region this year. As a member of the United Nations High-level Panel on Water, I attach high priority to implementing its comprehensive action plan. Bangladesh ensured access to safe water for 87 per cent of its population by 2015, and we aim for full access to safe water for our population by 2030. We believe that there are close links between peace, stability and development. We share the conviction that addressing poverty, hunger, illiteracy, unemployment and inequality is crucial to building peaceful, just and inclusive societies. We are committed to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In that regard, our Government has adopted a whole-of- society approach. The SDGs complement our vision to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country by 2021 and a developed one by 2041. Even before the adoption of the SDGs, we initiated unique social programmes that reflect the themes of the SDGs, such as the Ekti Bari Ekti Khamar â?? â??One Household One Farmâ?? project; community clinics; the Ashrayan shelter project and the Digital Bangladesh initiative. We also promote education support, womenâ??s empowerment, education for all, the social safety net, environmental protection, and investment and development. Our voluntary national review presented to the United Nations this year showcased our progress in and commitment to achieving the SDGs. In 2016-2017, Bangladeshâ??s economy posted a gross domestic product growth rate of more than 7.24 per cent, and our foreign currency reserves reached $32.1 billion. We have lowered the poverty rate from 56.7 per cent in 1991 to 23.2 per cent today. Our per capita income is expected to grow to $1,602 by the end of the current fiscal year, from only $543 in 2005-2006. Our life expectancy has increased to almost 72 years. These figures are indications of our inclusive development, in which no citizen is left behind. To ensure inclusive growth, promote investment and employment opportunities for all, we have launched an initiative to develop 100 special economic zones around the country. Our extensive social safety net measures give coverage to many vulnerable segments of our population, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic violence and vulnerable mothers under economic hardship. Special emphasis has been given to unlocking the potentials of physically challenged children and people. Some 103 service and care centres, along with 32 mobile therapy vans, attend to the needs of persons with disabilities, including those affected by autism. A total of 18,500 community health clinics are being complemented by medical services through the use of mobile phones and web cameras in districts and subdistricts. There is now a public primary school in every village of the country, and 38,331 educational institutions have been equipped with digital laboratories and multimedia classrooms. Special emphasis is being placed on promoting technical and vocational education and training for young people. Our youth are the main movers in realizing my vision for a knowledge-based, digital Bangladesh. We are working to create an environment to allow them to pursue transformative education, find decent jobs and turn into truly global citizens. I am happy to announce that Bangabandhu-1, our very first satellite, is scheduled to be launched this year on our Victory Day, 16 December. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that we do not want war. We want peace. We seek the well-being of humankind, not its destruction. We want sustainable development. Let this be our collective goal.",1,196
7717,Session 72 - 2017,BGR_72_2017.txt,BGR_72_2017,72,2017,BGR,"I would first like to offer my most sincere condolences to the people and Government of Mexico for yesterdayâ??s devastating earthquake. It is an honour for me to address this forum. I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and wish him every success in his important mission. This session is a special one for my country, since while it is still going on Bulgaria will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Union. This year the general debate puts a special emphasis on our common effort to strive for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, thereby highlighting the importance of prevention, mediation, sustainable development, preservation of the environment and respect for human rights through a people-centred approach. The United Nations upholds our shared goals of peace and security, and development and human rights. Conflicts in many parts of the world continue to undermine international peace and security and the fundamental values of humankind. Outbreaks of violence devastate local economies, trigger large movements of refugees and migrants, and spread diseases, famine and immense human suffering on a massive scale. Children are usually the most adversely affected in any crisis situation. The root causes of armed conflicts should be addressed in a more systematic way by ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law, improving the economic situation and promoting social inclusion. Leaving no one behind and reaching the farthest behind first are not simply political declarations meant to invigorate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. If we are to transform our world by lifting it out of poverty, we must fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting equality, inclusion and participation. Protracted conflicts require a holistic United Nations response, encompassing preventive diplomacy, mediation, peacebuilding and effective special political missions. That response is critical to restoring governance and stabilizing political, economic and social conditions in crisis and post-conflict countries. Over the past several years the United Nations peace and security architecture has benefited from three peace and security reviews that, together with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, have provided a solid foundation for achieving peace and prosperity. In that regard, Bulgaria supports the surge in diplomacy for peace, which places prevention as an overarching priority of the United Nations work and sets the stage for the necessary reforms to sustain peace. Prevention and mediation are essential means for reducing human suffering, including in addressing the root causes of forced displacements by bringing humanitarian, development and peacebuilding efforts together. The situation in the Middle East and North Africa remains of deep concern and should be addressed in a comprehensive manner, but the international community should not be distracted from the urgent need to revive the Middle East peace process. Bulgaria reaffirms its position that a two-State solution formula is the realistic, just and lasting way to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is our belief that a solution that can fulfil the aspirations of both sides can be achieved only through direct negotiations, with no conditions and in conformity with the relevant international obligations. Finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict in Syria and implementing a credible political transition in the country will be essential to preserving the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian State. We support all actions aimed at achieving a cessation of hostilities as soon as possible and conducting effective and constructive inter-Syrian negotiations in Geneva in order to achieve a lasting political solution to the crisis. We consider a political dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations to be the only way that can gradually improve the security situation in Syria and sustainably resolve the humanitarian crisis. Another source of deep concern to my country is the situation in eastern Ukraine, which, regrettably, remains highly volatile despite periodic ceasefire agreements. We reiterate our call for the swift and full implementation of the Minsk agreements, to which there is no viable alternative. We consistently support the activity of multilateral formats such as the Normandy Four and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Trilateral Contact Group, considering their role in advancing the political and diplomatic efforts for a peaceful settlement of the conflict to be key. Bulgaria is fully committed to the peace and stabilization process in Afghanistan and considers reconciliation a major prerequisite for stability and sustainable development in Afghanistan and beyond. We encourage the National Unity Government to continue with needed reforms in key areas, such as good governance, the rule of law, a credible electoral process, combating corruption and narcotics, and tackling gender and social issues. Disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control are among the main pillars of international security and therefore represent tangible aspects of the effort to achieve peace and a decent life. Bulgaria reiterates its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as to the objective of attaining a world free of nuclear weapons. That goal is achievable only through the participation of all States, and the nuclear-weapon States in particular. We should aim at feasible but universal measures that will gradually and irreversibly lead to the final objective of a world without nuclear weapons. The next two steps in that direction could be the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iranâ??s nuclear programme, concluded in July 2015, continues to be historically significant. Its full implementation is extremely important to regional and global stability, and my country reiterates its full support for it. Bulgaria categorically condemns the repeated nuclear tests and missile launches by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which have led to a further escalation of tensions in the region and are undermining world peace and security. We call on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to end its nuclear and ballistic programmes once and for all in a complete, irreversible and verifiable manner, and to engage in constructive dialogue with the international community. We reiterate our commitment to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation. The recent terrorist attacks are tragic reminders of the scale of the challenge ahead. Bulgaria shares the view that the newly established Office of Counter-Terrorism marks a milestone in the efforts to improve United Nations efficiency in fighting terrorism by supporting the balanced implementation of the 2006 Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, strengthening coordination among the relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, as well as promoting preventive measures that address the drivers of extremism. Bulgaria is deeply concerned about the unprecedented scale of organized looting of cultural property in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other countries in conflict or post-conflict situations. We condemn the illicit trafficking and illegal trade in cultural objects as a tactic of war and a source of profits for financing terrorism. It is a threat that requires a global response. A number of legal instruments and resolutions have been adopted by UNESCO, the United Nations, the European Parliament and others. We have laid the legal foundations and it is our common duty to ensure their full implementation. The Antiquities Coalition, UNESCOâ??s #Unite4Heritage social-media campaign and other activities epitomize a very positive global trend for action aimed at the preservation and protection of the worldâ??s cultural heritage. International migration is a global phenomenon, and only through joint efforts such as the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration can we ensure a balanced approach that includes respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as effective border management and re-admission. States have the right and responsibility to manage and control their borders as a central element of their national security. Strict border controls are vitally important, particularly in the context of preventing irregular migration and eradicating human trafficking. For Bulgaria, the top priority is the effective management and control of the European Unionâ??s external border, enabling free movement within the European Union to function smoothly. Climate change continues to represent one of the biggest challenges of our time. Not only is it a threat to our countriesâ?? well-being, it also poses a security risk to many of them. Bulgaria stands by its obligations under the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and believes that only a universal approach to its implementation can achieve the goals of the United Nations climate-change agenda. Bulgaria is strongly committed to promoting human rights and is actively involved in a number of intergovernmental processes dedicated to global advancement of the human rights agenda. As co-Chair of the Group of Friends for Children and the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations, Bulgaria strongly advocates for integrating childrenâ??s rights into all major intergovernmental processes, since children are the real agents of positive social change. As President of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the period 2017-2018, Bulgaria actively promotes the full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others. Bulgaria is determined to further contribute to promoting human rights internationally as a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021, and is relying on its partnersâ?? valuable support for its candidacy. In the past few decades, the United Nations has taken crucial steps to advance gender equality and womenâ??s empowerment. Those efforts should be further strengthened in order to achieve tangible results for women and girls by eliminating all forms of gender- based violence and discrimination. Ensuring equal rights for women and men should be an integral part of everyday policies in all spheres of life. Promoting equality, countering discrimination and ensuring respect for human rights are key to achieving lasting peace and sustainable development, and we believe that the protection of human rights should be at the centre of all actions undertaken by the United Nations. The world is currently facing enormous challenges, perhaps the greatest that humankind has ever encountered, and we, the Member States of the United Nations, must provide solutions to them. It is time to take action.",1,196
7718,Session 72 - 2017,BHR_72_2017.txt,BHR_72_2017,72,2017,BHR,"At the outset, I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k and his friendly country, Slovakia, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its current session and to pledge our full cooperation in the discharge of the duties with which he is entrusted. We are fully confident that, thanks to his insight and clear vision, he will successfully conduct the business of this session. I also wish to praise his choice of theme for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. This important theme meets the expectations of all countries and peoples. I also take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, for his able and competent presidency of the previous session. I renew my congratulations to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres and applaud his tireless efforts, as reflected in his important report on the work of the Organization (A/72/1), in which he demonstrates his resolve to reform its structure and management, enhance its role in the consolidation of international peace and security, and support sustainable development in response to the challenges and changing circumstances confronting us. In that connection, I also applaud the efforts of His Excellency President Donald Trump of the United States of America to support the reform of the United Nations. The Kingdom of Bahrain was among the first countries to sign the political declaration he initiated in support of the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform plan for the United Nations. I would be remiss if I did not express the Kingdom of Bahrainâ??s heartfelt condolences to the United States of America, Mexico and the Caribbean nations and their peoples on the natural disasters to which they have been subjected and which caused numerous fatalities and material damage. I reiterate our solidarity with them and pray that they will soon recover from their impact. Under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, King of the Kingdom of Bahrain; His Royal Highness Prince Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, Prime Minister; and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander and First Deputy Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain remains faithful to its consistent policy of enhancing partnerships with the United Nations and its various bodies in expression of its firm belief in the role that our Organization is playing to achieve a more stable and prosperous world. Accordingly, this year has witnessed numerous initiatives for fruitful cooperation, notably the launching of the King Hamad Youth Empowerment Award to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, aimed at consolidating the efforts of governmental and private entities to enhance the contribution of young people to the sustainable development process. In March, the Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa Global Award for Womenâ??s Empowerment was officially launched. That award, named after the wife of His Majesty the King and President of the Supreme Council for Women, is in full conformity with the objectives of the United Nations in enhancing the role of women in development. It also reflects the pioneering experience of Bahraini women, both nationally and internationally. Similarly, the International Youth Conference to Achieve Sustainable Development was held under the patronage of His Highness Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Representative of His Majesty the King for Charity Works and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme. It focused on raising awareness among young people of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enhancing their role in achieving them. In the context of Bahrainâ??s keen interest in pursuing its efforts to achieve the SDGs and to maintain its leading position among countries with very high indicators in the field of human development, according to international sources, Bahrain looks forward to the forthcoming signing of a strategic partnership framework with the United Nations for the period 2017- 2020. My country has also made strides towards the elimination of forced labour and human trafficking by ratifying the relevant international agreements and protocols. It further issued an act prohibiting all forms of human trafficking, with severe sentences imposed on the perpetrators, while also implementing the national referral system for the victims of trafficking â?? the first of its kind in the region â?? which provides a mechanism to monitor and redress that illegal practice. Recently, the Kingdom of Bahrain issued the Unified Family Law, a key legislative tool for the consolidation of the familyâ??s stability and the preservation of all its rights without exploitation or mistreatment. That is based on the noble teachings of Islam and the principles enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution that the family is the foundation of society. That law equally exemplifies Bahrainâ??s commitment to international instruments related to the family and women, including, most importantly, those of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. In support of the United Nations endeavours to address global warming and its implications in the area of climate change, the Kingdom of Bahrain deposited its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in December 2016, thereby renewing its commitment to that historic agreement, which we hope will consolidate international efforts to address that perilous phenomenon. The Kingdom of Bahrain firmly believes that the maintenance of stability and security in the Middle East and the entire world requires a strong and common political will, as well as serious collective efforts to guarantee respect for the basic principles underlying relations among States, such as good-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and compliance with international conventions and instruments, so that we can address the greatest challenge facing us, namely, terrorism, and deter individuals and entities from supporting and financing it. That is especially important now that terrorism is no longer limited to terrorist organizations that we are able to confront and eliminate. Rather, it has become a tool in the hands of States determined to generate crises in other countries in the pursuit of their own agenda. They have consequently become fully complicit partners in the commission of terrorist acts and a factor in the destabilization of international peace and security. Given the strategic importance of peace and security for our vital region, my country is seeking to establish strategic partnerships within its own region and with its allies. As partners, we can work together to preserve the security of the Gulf region, combat terrorism and provide protection for international navigation and commerce routes, in particular through close cooperation between the Bahrain Defense Force and the American Fifth Fleet, based in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The summit of the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the United States of America was held in May this year in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and produced a memorandum of understanding to establish a centre responsible for combating the financing of terrorism. That and the Arab-Islamic- American summit are both important landmarks in combating terrorism in that they establish a strategic and effective partnership among the United States of America, the States of the GCC and the other Arab Islamic countries. We reaffirm that the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, which was inaugurated in Riyadh on the sidelines of the GCC-United States summit, will make a significant contribution to combating extremist ideologies and will promote the values of tolerance and coexistence throughout the world. In that context, I commend the General Assemblyâ??s adoption of resolution 71/291, which established the Office of Counter-Terrorism, an important step towards the consolidation of international efforts to address that scourge. It is no longer acceptable that among us there are rogue countries that continue to occupy othersâ?? territories, thereby violating the sovereignty of States, threatening international peace and security, supporting extremism and terrorism, and spreading hate and anarchy. It is no longer tenable that we allow those countries to join our efforts to end struggles, resolve conflicts and halt complex humanitarian tragedies â?? situations that those countries were responsible for aggravating. We should refuse them the opportunity to be included among us and to misuse their voice to satisfy their ambitions and hostile goals. Confronting those countries is a duty and a responsibility that the entire international community must shoulder. They should either respect their commitments and keep pace with the collective international will to achieve peace, development and welfare, or be held clearly accountable and suffer isolation and the severe consequences of international resolutions and laws. Against that backdrop, and to consolidate anti-terrorist and anti-extremist efforts, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Arab Republic of Egypt, with the support of many other countries, availed themselves of their sovereign right under international law to sever relations with Qatar. That followed a long period of patience during which we exhausted all available means to halt Qatarâ??s policies that violated all fraternal relations of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Qatar provided financial support and safe haven to terrorists and fugitives and disseminated a narrative replete with hate and extremism through its media and the individuals and institutions supporting it â?? all of whom we have placed on a unified terrorist list and most of whom are also included on international terrorist lists. That was done to make the situation clear to the entire world following the fallout of that terrorism, which spread to many countries, including my own. Qatar has supported systematic terrorist acts whose consequences we have suffered in the Kingdom of Bahrain and which have cost us the lives of many innocent civilians and security personnel. It has done so with a view to undermining national security and societal peace and overthrowing the Government system with the support of their affiliates. It is therefore our collective responsibility to protect our States and peoples from those who seek to harm them, and to confront them firmly. If Qatar is serious â?? by its actions and not only its words â?? about engaging in dialogue and reclaiming its place among us, it must respond positively and commit to our reasonable demands in full transparency, based on the principles enshrined in the joint statement issued following meeting of the four countries in Cairo on 5 July 2017, in full conformity with international covenants and instruments. In that connection, we highly appreciate the tireless efforts and the good offices of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. We stress the fact that all actions taken against Qatar are directed neither against our peoples nor the Qatari people, for whom we have nothing but respect and affection and with whom we are linked by religion, family relations and a common history. We will always support their security and stability, and to that end, our countries have taken a number of measures to address the humanitarian issues, including those concerning family relations and health conditions. That was clearly shown by the facilities recently provided to Qataris 17-29807 15/32 by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including for Hajj and Umrah. That confirms the solid ties and refutes assertions of blockades or violations of human rights. I take this opportunity to express my countryâ??s congratulations to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the great success of the Hajj season, which has been widely praised by all those participating in that major Islamic rite. It is a meaningful riposte to all those seeking to politicize the Hajj and turn it into an occasion for fomenting conflict and sedition. In attending to its highest priority, the Saudi Government thereby demonstrated its outstanding ability to protect the Two Holy Mosques and other sacred sites, as well as all the visitors performing the rites of Hajj or Umrah. Regimes that constantly seek to spread anarchy and evil are instruments of destruction and will be the biggest losers as they drift away from the values of collective cooperation among nations. Such is the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the people suffer from oppression, misery and poverty while gallows are erected in the streets. Living conditions are harsh and have taken that people â?? who are rich in history and civilization â?? backward dozens of years. Their resources are wasted to fuel violence and undermine the regionâ??s security for the sake of realizing Iranâ??s hegemonic and expansionist ambitions through its Revolutionary Guard and its affiliates, such as the terrorist Hizbullah in Lebanon and Syria, the militias in Yemen and the terrorist cells and groups in the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq, as well as other countries that have suffered because of those hostile actions for such a protracted period. We believe that the statement by the American President before the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.3) presents an accurate interpretation that clearly denounces the dangerous nature of the Iranian rogue regime, which undermines peace in the region. The world must confront that regime, stop it from pursuing its policies and financing of terrorism and oblige it to respect its neighboursâ?? sovereignty. Since we always aspire to peace, we affirm that establishing normal ties with Iran is subject to the latter relinquishing its hegemonic, sectarian and ideological policies. Iran must respect the national values of peoples and refrain from exporting its revolution, which is based on a theocratic system of government. It must abide by the principles of good neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries. We also call on Iran to end its occupation of the three Emirati islands â?? Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa â?? and to respond favourably to the peaceful initiative of the United Arab Emirates to recoup sovereignty over its territories, either through direct and serious negotiations, or by referral to the International Court of Justice. On the other hand, the Republic of Iraq, which has suffered for so long and is still suffering from foreign interference, has recently achieved, with the means available to it, the liberation of the cities of Mosul and Tal Afar from the grip of Daâ??esh. That would not have been possible without the immense sacrifices by the Iraqi armed forces, the determination by the Government under Haider Al Abadi and the support provided by the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh, of which Bahrain is an active member. We reaffirm our constant support for all efforts aimed at restoring peace and security throughout Iraq and preserving its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. With regard to the situation in the Republic of Yemen, we reiterate our firm position of support for the legitimate Government under the leadership of President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour. We support that Government through our participation in the Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen and through our support for the measures taken by the legitimate Government to extend its authority over all of Yemeni territory and to put an end to militias that attempt coups dâ??Ã©tat with the support of foreign powers. We support the Governmentâ??s steps to reach a comprehensive political solution on the basis of international mandates, notably the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the national dialogue and Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). That will terminate all forms of foreign intervention and put an end to the critical humanitarian situation of the Yemeni people. We reaffirm that we do not side with any one Yemeni party against the other, but rather we oppose foreign intervention that seeks to harm this beloved country. We appreciate the efforts of Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Yemen. We in the Syrian Arab Republic urge the international community to exert greater efforts to protect civilians and save their lives, to compel all parties to abide by the ceasefire decision and the establishment of the de-escalation zones, to guarantee access to besieged areas for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and to intensify support to countries hosting large numbers of our Syrian brethren, most notably the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. That is in addition to pushing forward all efforts aimed at achieving a political solution that would preserve Syriaâ??s unity and territorial integrity while ending foreign intervention in its internal affairs. The solution should also see the abolition of all terrorist organizations and provide peace and security to all Syrians so they can actively participate in the determination of their own future, on the basis of the first Geneva communiquÃ© (A/66/865, annex) and Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016). We reaffirm our support for the Astana talks and the action of the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, in the hope that they will contribute to the resolution of this protracted crisis. In Libya, we applaud the liberation of a number of major cities from the hands of terrorist groups. We reaffirm our full support for the efforts of all actors to achieve consensus among all Libyan parties and for the implementation of the political agreement signed in Skhirat. Those efforts include those by Libyaâ??s neighbouring countries and the meetings held in the United Arab Emirates and the French Republic between Mr. Faiez Serraj, President of the Presidency Council of the Government of National Accord of Libya, and Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, Commander-in-Chief of the Libyan army. We hope that such efforts will continue with a view to preserving Libyaâ??s unity and territorial integrity, consistent with the aspirations of the people for development and progress. We also welcome the appointment of Mr. Ghassan SalamÃ© as Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Libya and wish him every success. With regard to the question of the Moroccan Sahara, the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the need to support the negotiations aimed at achieving a consensual and final political solution to that problem, in the context of national sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco and on the basis of relevant Security Council resolutions that confirm the seriousness of Moroccoâ??s self-government initiative. We urge all parties to fully cooperate with the United Nations in that regard. We reiterate our total objection to the plight of Muslims in Myanmar as a result of excessive use of force. We call on the Myanmar Government to assume its responsibilities in protecting the Rohingya Muslims and to facilitate their access to all forms of relief and assistance so as to put an end to this human tragedy. The Palestinian question is at the top of the foreign- policy priorities of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which has always stood with the Palestinian people in their legitimate aspirations to enjoy all their legitimate rights, including an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital and within the borders of 4 June 1967, in conformity with the relevant international resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution. We welcome the positive steps taken lately by Palestinian factions to end their divisions in favour of the vital Palestinian interests through political work and non-violence. We commend the pivotal role played by His Excellency President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of the Arab Republic of Egypt in that respect. It confirms the central role of Egypt in the support of causes related to the Arab nation, of which it constitutes the strategic centre. It is the main pillar of peace and security in the region. The Palestinian question is not a religious issue. Palestine is the cradle of religions where everyone lived in perfect harmony. Rather, it is a political issue par excellence, an issue of territorial occupation that must end. Its people must return to their homeland. Rights denied must be restored to their owners. That precisely is what Israel, notwithstanding all its security concerns, should understand, for it will achieve peace for its people and for itself only when it abandons all forms of violence against Palestinians. It should halt its settlement activities and stop violating the sanctity of religious sites, especially the repeated aggressions and provocative acts in the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, which enrage Muslims all over the world and impede the resumption of the peace process and all regional and international initiatives in its support. At this juncture, we wish to express our sincere appreciation for the commendable work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the substantial assistance it provides the Palestinians inside the territory and in the neighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Bahrain stresses the need to achieve universal adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, taking into account the right of all peoples to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Also, Israel should implement the resolution issued by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons pertaining to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East. Equally, we stress the need for Iran to implement Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), on the Iranian nuclear agreement, including those parts concerning ballistic and other weapons. Iran will face severe sanctions if it violates the commitments outlined in that resolution or in the international safeguard system of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Further, we welcome Security Council resolution 2375 (2017), which pertains to new sanctions on North Korea, in view of its continued nuclear and ballistic missiles tests, which threaten its neighbours and international peace and security. Since its inception as an Arab and Islamic entity in 1783, the Kingdom of Bahrain has firmly believed in the importance of collective action in the pursuit of security, development and prosperity. It orients all of its means toward the service of its people, its region and the world as a whole. Since time immemorial, Allah has blessed it with wise leadership that has inherited an acute sense of responsibility for the achievement of the ultimate objectives of ideal relations with its neighbours. It will steadfastly follows that path and will never go astray. It will remain an effective member of the international community and a trusted partner in its Arab and Islamic setting and will hold onto that approach as the solid foundation of its foreign relations. We will remain open to all cultures and peoples, in the spirit of tolerance and moderation, and will pursue the path to progress and development with determination and perseverance in order to safeguard our achievements, development and prosperity.",1,196
7719,Session 72 - 2017,BHS_72_2017.txt,BHS_72_2017,72,2017,BHS,"On behalf of the people and the Government of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy- second session and to assure him of my countryâ??s full support and cooperation during his tenure. I would also like to sincerely congratulate his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson, on his stewardship of the Assembly during the seventy-first session. The Bahamas congratulates Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his recent appointment as Secretary-General, with the daunting task of continuing the implementation of the bold and ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I commend him for the work he has done so far in steering the work of the Organization and assure him of the full support of the Bahamas. Since 29 September 1729, when the first meeting of the Parliament of the Bahamas took place, democratic values have taken deep root throughout the archipelago. On 10 May this year, the Bahamas conducted its eleventh consecutive round of general elections since our establishment of universal suffrage in 1962. The people of the Bahamas, in a free, peaceful and democratic process, elected a Government led by Mr. Hubert Minis. The new Administration is made up almost exclusively of new members, one of them as young as 21 years old. We promised our people bold change and we are committed to fulfilling that promise. We stand on the threshold of advancing a new agenda as demanded by our people, one that has at its core the protection and promotion of the rights, interest and welfare of all Bahamians â?? women, men, young people and children. I am therefore proud today to make my first address to this organ as the most recently appointed Foreign Minister of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas under this new administration. Economies large and small are facing very difficult times, where myriad factors challenge our capacity to create an environment where people can be assured of sustainable livelihoods, security, safety and a promising future for succeeding generations. Very troubling are the insidious increase in international terrorism; unfair practices in the international financial sector, such as de-risking and correspondent banking; crime; trafficking in persons, drugs and weapons; gross violations of human rights; and reprehensible corruption by those who have been entrusted to govern. Of special concern to small island developing States (SIDS) are the dangers of environmental degradation and climate change, which threaten our very survivability. With what we have witnessed just recently with the passage of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and now Maria, I cannot underscore sufficiently the importance the Bahamas attaches to combating climate change and the preservation and protection of the environment. Even while these hurricanes were occurring, earthquakes took place in Mexico, resulting in further tragic loss of life and destruction. Climate change is global. We have expressed before and today we reiterate our thoughts and prayers to all adversely impacted by these devastating events. I need to emphasize that this is the third time in three years that the Bahamas has been hit by a major hurricane, and Maria is still churning in our territory. There are two more months before the end of the hurricane season, and we can only pray that we will be spared further destruction and loss. Hurricane Irma changed course and did not directly hit the entire Bahamian archipelago, thereby minimizing the impact on our tourism industry. However, we were not entirely spared. Our southern islands experienced serious damage. Ragged Island was totally devastated and is now uninhabitable. Additionally, tornadoes inflicted considerable damage on the northern islands of Bimini and Grand Bahama. We are grateful to our international partners, which provided immediate support after the passage of Hurricane Irma and now continue to stand by our side as we begin the painful and burdensome process of restoration and rebuilding. I commend the President and the Secretary-General for convening the recent high-level meeting to allow those of us impacted to bring focus on these events to our other partners. One of the countries immediately affected by Hurricane Irma was the Republic of Cuba, which, as on previous occasions, caused this massive hurricane to lose some of its energy and probably lessened its impact on our neighbour, the United States of America. All developing countries affected have been placed on a short list for assistance to shore up their internal conditions towards recovery. Cuba does not enjoy this capacity to the fullest. The Bahamas joins other nations in calling for the United States Congress to reconsider the legislative barriers to the biggest of the Caribbean islands in order for it to develop to its fullest potential as a member of the international community. It is the intention of the Government, working with the private sector, to create out of the destruction of Ragged Island the first fully green island in the region, utilizing renewable energy and smart technologies, from solar energy to sustainable water-purification systems, to create a more sustainable and resilient island community. The implications for the existence of SIDS such as the Bahamas, as we are confronted with global warming, rising sea-levels, more severe and frequent hurricanes and other extreme weather events, are all too clear. For the first time in its history, the Bahamas evacuated whole communities to safe quadrants ahead of Hurricane Irma. What happens next â?? a wholesale evacuation of the entire Caribbean? I call on the international community to recognize the imperative of accelerating efforts to deal urgently with the adverse impact of climate change, and to do so in a coordinated way. Only then will we mitigate against these ferocious and frequent destructive weather events, which now potentially threaten to add to the worldâ??s migration issues. Well over two decades ago, my Government, recognizing the very real threat posed to our very existence, upgraded its human capital capacity to address the unintended consequences of climate change and its commitment to environmental conservation. Through its many marine protected areas, the Bahamas is committed to the conservation of sustainable oceans, as well as through our active involvement in initiatives, such as the 10x20 initiative, and our participation in the consultative process of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. In this context, the Bahamas has presented its candidature once again for a seat on the Council of the International Maritime Organization in category C. The continuing imperative for us in the Bahamas and the Caribbean is the re-evaluation of the measurements used to determine economic well-being. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its policy brief on vulnerability and debt in small States, recognized that many SIDS face an uncertain future. The Bahamas continues to dispute the use of per capita gross domestic product/gross national product as an instrument to measure wealth and economic development. The use of this one-dimensional instrument prohibits countries that are most in need from receiving development assistance or loans at concessional rates. It is time for us to replace that metric with a realistic measurement that takes into account the vulnerability and fragility of SIDS to exogenous shocks. Notwithstanding our best efforts at self-sufficiency, exogenous shocks in the form of reduced correspondent banking relationships continue to create challenges for the region. International banking institutions, fearing that they may be subject to fines and sanctions related to the illicit activities of money-laundering and terrorist financing, have pulled out en masse. Citizens in our region depend on the services provided by these entities and have now become severely disadvantaged as a result of the actions taken. This threatens our ability to remain competitive as one of the leading international centres and hinders our efforts to expand our trading relations. The head of the IMF, Ms. Christine Lagarde, spoke convincingly in 2016 on the subject of correspondent banking, highlighting that all stakeholders had to uphold their end of the bargain. For its part, the Bahamas has invested in a strong compliance regime, at great financial cost. We invite the international community to work together to find another way to deal with the issue and allow input from those to be impacted by their decisions before moving the goal post yet again. Despite the challenges faced, the Government of the Bahamas remains committed to a comprehensive development agenda for the country. With the launch of the national development plan Vision 2040 in the coming months, we will set a course towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. In this connection, the Bahamas has committed to participating in the voluntary national review process at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, in 2018. We appreciate the support of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in this regard. Indeed, it is through this anticipated integrated framework that we shall address the range of challenges that face our nation. The scourges of terrorism and trafficking in arms of all types continue to impact our way of life. The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to standing with the international community in the fight against terrorism in all its forms. We also stand in solidarity with the peoples of France, Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom, who have recently experienced horrific terrorist attacks. Violence in the furtherance of political aims is never the answer. Only through dialogue and negotiations will aspirations be realized. I spoke earlier about the importance of accountability, truth and transparency in Government and the importance of the rule of law to good governance. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, â??Corruption is a global phenomenon found in all countries â?? but evidence shows it harms poor people more than others, stifles economic growth and diverts desperately needed funds from education, health care and other public services. An estimated $1 trillion get siphoned off through bribes every year, according to the World Bank.â?? The Government of the Bahamas has firmly committed itself to eradicating criminality and corruption. We are resolved to have in place an efficient, results-based public sector, with an Office of the Ombudsman, in order to create the best environment possible for promoting economic development, foreign direct investment, small business development and equal opportunity for all to share in prosperity. The role of the United Nations in advancing human rights has been essential. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a series of international instruments, human rights operations on the ground and the various human rights bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, permit the United Nations to continue as a beacon to promote and protect human rights through both immediate and long-term action. We in the Bahamas are committed to protecting and promoting the rights of Bahamians and, indeed, all humankind. The achievements of the Bahamas relative to human rights have derived from collaboration with all stakeholders and a willingness to explore fresh approaches to long-standing challenges. Within that context, I am pleased to announce that the Bahamas is seeking election to the Human Rights Council for the term 2019-2021. As a member of the Council and a small island developing State, the Bahamas will bring to that body a fresh, distinct and constructive perspective, with the potential to add depth and richness to human rights advancement and discourse. The Government of the Bahamas believes that education must be at the heart of driving sustainable development, where we build resilience and an educated, inclusive and diverse workforce and community. That has positive implications for the creativity, innovation and productivity that allow learners and young people to fulfil their potential to act as agents of social change. For that reason, our Government has designed an education agenda that encourages life-long learning and recognizes the potential of technology and digital platforms to serve as tools in the teaching and learning process. I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Assembly the fact that the Bahamas, in recognition of the invaluable role of technology and communications in education and all aspects of development, has presented its candidature for a seat on the Council of the International Telecommunication Union. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted in September 2016 by the General Assembly, called for the development of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. We commend the ongoing work in preparation for the global compact. While recognizing the potential yields of global migration relative to the reduction of poverty and global inequality, we believe that proper cooperation, through the appropriate mechanisms, can help to ensure that migration occurs through safe and regulated channels, to the benefit of all countries involved. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the targets to be achieved with respect to non-communicable diseases and the need to mobilize the necessary financing. We also recognize the successes experienced in the global AIDS response, and caution the international community, at this important juncture, to resist complacency and continue to offer support to achieve targets and to sustain the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS. The Bahamas supports the work of peacekeeping operations and the Department under which they fall as a fundamental instrument to build, protect and maintain peace and security within the United Nations. We note the approach of the termination of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the establishment of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. As was the case with MINUSTAH, the Bahamas looks forward to doing its part to support Haitiâ??s continued national development. We also join the continued support and engagement of the international community in Haiti. During the main session, the General Assembly will consider and approve the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019. It is our expectation that the General Assembly will, in a transparent and constructive manner, approve a budget that aligns with the mandates and activities of the United Nations. We welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s initial efforts to promote management reform aimed at strengthening service delivery. We encourage the Secretary-General, in the execution of the budget, to continue to find innovative means to advance an efficient implementation of mandates, but without arbitrary cuts. The Bahamas values the role of the United Nations as the custodian of the interests of the worldâ??s people, in particular the poor and the vulnerable. We believe that the Charter of the United Nations remains a viable and firm foundation onto which global peace and security, social progress and economic development can be built.",1,196
7720,Session 72 - 2017,BIH_72_2017.txt,BIH_72_2017,72,2017,BIH,"I would first like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the task you have just embarked on in leading the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I am convinced that your tact and diplomacy, which we in Bosnia and Herzegovina have witnessed first-hand, will help the most important body of the United Nations make new progress and effectively face new challenges. My gratitude also goes to the outgoing President for the leadership he showed during the seventy-first session. I would also like to join others in congratulating His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations. His noble and wise intention to devote more attention to building bridges to connect us all in the years ahead will certainly have all of Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ??s support. In a world dominated by uncertainty and insecurity, it is simply not possible to overstate the importance of the principles and the multilateral framework defined for us by the founders of the United Nations. The strength of the Organization lies in both our individual and shared strengths in our efforts to eradicate diseases, hunger, terrorism and every other threat to human existence. In doing so, of course, we must admit to ourselves how necessary and important it is to use thoughtful and constructive measures to bring the United Nations system closer to its surroundings and enable it to adapt so that it can anticipate the challenges its environment presents and respond to them with a force that is far stronger than the simple sum of our individual abilities. We continue to witness and to be deeply concerned about the ongoing suffering of the Syrian people. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly condemns every form of violence against Syriaâ??s civilian population. The violence must stop. The dignity of every Syrian woman, man and child, and of every Syrian refugee, must be restored. Their belief in the possibility of recovery and opportunities for a new life must also be restored. We and many other delegations in this Hall today will continue to call for a peaceful and political solution to the conflict through negotiations. That process must be owned by the Syrian people alone, based on the Geneva communiquÃ© (S/2012/522, annex), and with the assistance of the international community and the United Nations, led by the Special Envoy for Syria, whose selfless efforts to continue the negotiations in Geneva are highly appreciated. It seems superfluous to repeat that there can be no peace and prosperity for the Israeli people if the same is not provided for the Palestinians, and vice versa. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents the most serious unresolved problem in the Middle East, and the current absence of any negotiations between the parties is disturbing. Both nations deserve better. Again â?? and this has been the case for decades â?? the journey towards peace has been too slow and has become more and more complex. It is therefore essential that we steadfastly recall the ultimate goal, which is the existence of two States, Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side, in safety and within recognized borders. Bosnia and Herzegovina still believes that this goal can be achieved if both parties can fulfil their obligations as set forth in the relevant Security Council resolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace Initiative. Evil has existed throughout human history. Sometimes it is on the margins of our communities. Sometimes, to a greater or lesser degree, it is inside them. It does not always take the same form or manifest itself with the same intensity. Terrorism is undoubtedly the greatest evil of our times, and its form and strength represent the greatest threat we have to international peace and security. Destructive forces have always had deep roots and many different faces, but there can be no justification for their existence. We need united, concentrated efforts, along with a multidimensional and integrated approach, to overcome terrorism and permanently eliminate the fear of terror from our communities. Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to contribute to the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We particularly welcome the efforts of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres in strengthening the counter- terrorism capacities of the United Nations and, in that regard, the establishment of the new Office of Counter- Terrorism. For our part, we are ready to constantly strengthen cooperation at the regional, subregional and international levels, especially in the areas of information collection and exchange. As a member of the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh, we will continue to support the Coalitionâ??s efforts to liberate entire communities and help them recover from the suffering and harm imposed by Daâ??esh and its global network. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the full implementation of all Security Council resolutions aimed at bringing persons involved in financing, planning, preparing or executing terrorist acts to justice. Furthermore, we fully share the view that for the long- term eradication of the evil of terrorism and violent 17-29389 13/27 extremism, it is necessary to continuously invest in efforts along the entire spectrum of interconnected areas, from the eradication of injustice, inequality, poverty and a lack of freedom to improving understanding among those who differ, and to strengthen intercultural dialogue and generally accepted democratic values. Once we start thinking that we have done enough in all those areas, we need to start again and redouble our efforts. A world without the threat of the total destruction of humankind is less utopian if there are fewer means and arms for destruction. Disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are therefore still prerequisites for the global peace and security that we all strive for. In that context, Bosnia and Herzegovina joins the strong condemnation of the nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. We also call on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to comply without delay, fully and unconditionally, with its obligations under all relevant Security Council resolutions. My faith in the value of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is as strong today as it was two years ago, when we adopted it. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has received due institutional attention, based on its significance and the nobility of the goals it sets for us. The roles have been defined, the goals are clear and coordination has been established. For us, as well as for other developing countries burdened by the discrepancies between wishes and possibilities, strong political will and decisive practical steps in the right direction will not always be enough. Fulfilling the noble and ambitious Sustainable Development Goals requires knowledge and norms that many Member States do not have. It might produce an additional burden on the already overburdened State budgets. Assistance in formulating strategies and policies, transferring technologies, providing financial resources and measuring progress is therefore indisputably crucial, along with, of course, countriesâ?? full ownership of the implementation processes. In that connection, we have fully understood and accepted the strong interconnectedness of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. We have ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and have chosen to follow its guidelines. It is a debt to our children and to the planet that has to be unconditionally fulfilled. Whether in our past, present or future, women in my country hold high positions that rightfully and naturally belong to them. The role of women is vital to the development and prosperity of the family as well as of society as a whole. In post-conflict environments, women are always the first to extend the hand of reconciliation. In times of great challenges and risks, we need the strength and natural ability of women more than ever in order to pursue peaceful solutions. Although we are extremely proud of the significant progress we have made in implementing the provisions of the historic Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, we are also aware of the areas where it is possible and necessary to do considerably more. We will certainly continue to invest in additional efforts to strengthen and empower Bosnian women and girls in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Another social group that deserves special attention is young people, who are a constant source of change and an incubator of inventive solutions to the problems we inherit from the past. When healthy, educated, and employed, they are the engine that drives our societies forward. Environments in which young people have limited access to education, economic development and decision-making processes are subject to frustration, social unrest and instability. For that reason, a significant part of the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina is dedicated to creating conditions for reducing youth unemployment, corresponding to targets 8.5 and 8.6 of Goal 8 of the 2030 Agenda. Unfortunately, in Bosnia and Herzegovina we know all too much about the high price of war. For us, preventive diplomacy is a tool that, when used at the right time, can help ensure that wars are never repeated anywhere. There are many reasons why, on a global level, the United Nations system must be at the heart of all activities that use preventive measures in order to resolve crises and prevent people from being displaced from their homes. Again, much of the responsibility for prevention lies at other levels. Within our communities, we must counter all symptoms of trouble and conflicts. We must correct social injustice, reconcile what seems irreconcilable, persevere in compromise, strive for pluralistic and inclusive solutions, give equal weight to our own rights and those of others and constantly seek ways to find a common language. I believe that prevention and mediation, as well as conflict management techniques and conflict resolution in divided societies, should be applied first within the region at issue, with regional actors who generally better understand the opposing sides, their reasoning and their different views of the problem. We are proud of our participation in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Cyprus, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali. We consider that to be the most direct contribution of Bosnia and Herzegovina to building world peace. We also see our involvement in United Nations missions as a way to do things that are possible today but that not long ago were almost impossible to even imagine, and so to help people in areas affected by conflicts. Bosnia and Herzegovina has learned lessons from its difficult past, and for the future it has chosen to follow the principles set by the founders of the European Union 60 years ago. We have adopted the European path, and, choosing between cooperation and confrontation, we chose and will always choose cooperation in the search for common compromises. On our own, but also with the unselfish help of our European friends, we do everything we can to find as many opportunities for open dialogue as possible, and we use each of those opportunities to build even more trust and mutually beneficial connections for our people, who, despite difficulties and complicated times, have more common links and interests than we, their leaders, are sometimes willing to recognize. Reconciliation, trust, partnership and cooperation among all of us, in contexts both broad and narrow, must become living and long-term principles for a stable and secure future. Commitment to regional initiatives and constructive action through the regional organizations to which we belong are therefore high on the list of our foreign-policy priorities. Bosnia and Herzegovina is now doing everything it can to speed up its progress to where it really belongs, within the framework of a strong European family, whose values it shares. Reform and other processes that we are pursuing for that purpose are not always simple or easy, but we see them as a unique opportunity to accelerate the harmonization of our economic, social and institutional development with what awaits us tomorrow in the European Union. We will therefore continue to fulfil the obligations we have undertaken in order to reach the status of candidate by the beginning of 2018 with true commitment, which will be a powerful and much needed boost to internal consolidation and the further acceleration of integration processes. However, it is with concern that I wish to draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to the fact that my country is going through a period of important challenges. I am deeply convinced that one people in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be happy and prosperous if the other two are not, and indeed if all other people living in our country are not. In that regard, I believe that it is up to us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to make a crucial step to adopt changes to our electoral legislation by the end of this year, in accordance with the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the past, we expect understanding and support of the international community in solving the issue, because it is of vital importance for further democratizing and achieving our full integration into the European Union. Allow me to conclude with a reminder that all of our needs â?? economic, social, security, political and cultural â?? can be very diverse, as are our possibilities for achieving them. The choices we make every day to ensure prosperity for our people also vary from one Member State to another. I am convinced that the future of humankind will largely depend on our ability to turn our differences into advantages. We expect the United Nations system to guide us in that and to assist us, above all, in building a system based on unity in diversity.",1,196
7721,Session 72 - 2017,BLR_72_2017.txt,BLR_72_2017,72,2017,BLR,"The past few decades have been marked by two contradictory trends â?? increasing political fragmentation and increasing economic globalization. The first of those is associated with the global political instability that has resulted from wars, conflicts, terrorism, xenophobia and other factors and that is giving rise to a feeling of mounting chaos and despair. Why are we in this predicament? Because we did not truly put an end to our last momentous conflict, the Cold War. It did not end with a peace treaty, as had always been the case with previous major wars. As a result, we were left without the generally accepted frameworks that could have guided our subsequent behaviour. The various Powers formed differing interpretations of this state of geopolitical uncertainty and acted accordingly. What seemed obvious and legitimate to some was incomprehensible and illegitimate for others. Basically, all the problems that have accumulated since the early 1990s are the legacy of our inability to bring an end the Cold War once and for all. But it is never too late to do the right thing. Last year, the President of Belarus came up with the idea of launching a new negotiating process similar to the Helsinki process of the 1970s, while, needless to say, keeping in mind the problems and threats that are relevant to us today. We believe that the possibility of expanding and reconsidering that format is worth discussing. We propose that the key global players, particularly China, Russia, the United States of America and the States of the European Union, engage in a dialogue on a strategic vision for new and constructive relations. For its part, the Republic of Belarus is ready to provide the forum for such a dialogue. We are willing to carry out that task with the same responsibility that we have shown over the past few years in the efforts to settle the crisis in Ukraine. Minsk is prepared to be the bridge that can connect the issues of the past with those yet to come. We believe that the agreements that could result from such a dialogue would, in essence, put an end to that last major war. They could subsequently be implemented through the active engagement of the United Nations, and with that, stop the growing political fragmentation in the world in its tracks. Some may consider this unrealistic in todayâ??s world, but three years ago the President of the Republic of Belarusâ??s proposal to send peacekeepers to Ukraine was greeted in exactly the same way, and yet now that idea has been revived and is being actively discussed in the United Nations. Growing globalization, the second of the two trends under discussion, has undoubtedly contributed to progress and economic development worldwide, but it too has its downside. The fact is that the majority of the worldâ??s population has not been able to enjoy its benefits, especially in the past few decades, and as a consequence, we have been unable to eliminate poverty and inequality has steadily risen. Much has been said in recent years, including from this rostrum, about the economic reasons for this situation, but to put it bluntly, the global economy has not been run according to a win-win formula. It is designed to suit the interests not of ordinary people but of corporate capital. As a result, economic globalization has not been that rising tide that lifts all boats. Nevertheless, there are are some grounds for optimism. We base that on two factors â?? regional integration and new creative ideas in the global economy. Regional integration is a key feature of todayâ??s world. Where it is successful, it leaves less room for political fragmentation. Belarus has been actively involved in a number of integration processes in its region. This year, for example, we hold the chairmanship of the Central European Initiative. In the past few years, Belarus has been vigorously advocating for cooperation and interconnectivity among regional processes, an approach we call â??integrating integrationsâ??. It is based on the assumption that, in terms of structural functionality, todayâ??s world is made up of regions as well as countries. We firmly believe that cooperation among regional integration processes is as essential to their functioning as it is to that of States. And where creative new ideas are concerned, we would like to single out the One Belt, One Road initiative promoted by the Peopleâ??s Republic of China, which represents a new type of economic multilateralism, one that seeks to bring benefits not only to its individual participants but to the global economy as a whole and is a true win-win approach. The Republic of Belarus both participates in and supports that initiative. In our view, â??integrating integrationsâ?? and One Belt, One Road can help us shift the global economy from a path of divergence to one of convergence. Globalization must become more fair. How can the United Nations help to address the challenges posed by political fragmentation and uneven economic globalization? One of its primary tasks in the previous century was to prevent the great Powers from waging wars among themselves. It succeeded in that task, providing a forum where opposing parties could work towards a positive end. The result was that a third World War did not happen. Today the realities are different, and they require us to reconsider the Organizationâ??s role and place in our world. In particular, the question is about how the United Nations fits into a world that is increasingly dominated by various closed clubs and informal entities. We believe that, as it has always done, the United Nations must work to strengthen the system of inter-State relations. It is at the United Nations that its Members can successfully resolve their differences, forge mutually acceptable solutions and tackle transboundary threats. For its part, the United Nations should serve as a unifying force for the international relations system as a whole. In other words, the entire complex network of new dimensions in those relations â?? closed clubs, informal entities, alliances and others â?? should be anchored in the United Nations. If that is done, the system we have can function in a coherent, concerted and effective manner. The new Secretary-General has launched a comprehensive process for reform of the United Nations, and we welcome this undertaking on the whole. We would particularly like to highlight the relevance and importance of his initiatives where the maintenance of international peace and security and the fight against terrorism are concerned. We realize that the degree of success of this transformation will to a large extent determine the role and place of the Organization in the world for many years to come, and we believe that success will come if we all uphold three major principles. First, reform must be transparent, logical and result-oriented. Secondly, it should not lead to more red tape or a greater burden on Member States. Thirdly, reform should be inclusive. Every Member Stateâ??s voice must be heard. However, the most important part of reform of the United Nations system is not about reviewing the interactions and alignment of its individual bodies or optimizing its personnel and funding. Its most serious, meaningful and far- reaching reform can and must occur in our relationship to the Organization. Today the General Assembly constitutes a unique deliberative forum that is essential to our recognition of both the fragility and the diversity of our world. We, the Member States, need to regain our sense of ownership of our Organization, which has been somewhat lost. The United Nations is not made up just of its Secretariat and its field missions, programmes and funds. First and foremost, it is about its Member States and their will or lack of it, about dialogue and cooperation or alienation. No ideal composition of the Security Council or perfectly optimized General Assembly agenda will mean anything to the world beyond the East River unless Member States demonstrate a willingness to look for ways to better understand one another and agree more often. Only in the most minimal way does our routine work in the General Assembly, agreeing on the texts of multiple lengthy resolutions, represent dialogue and an effort to understand our opponents. Our various thematic side events provide a platform for dozens of speakers to present their views, and yet they very rarely try to find an answer to the question of what we must do to better understand one another. How often, during our official meetings and informal consultations, do inconsistent arguments and unanswered questions hang in the air without a response, or simply without being heard? That is why we are absolutely certain that real reform of the United Nations will come only when together we decide to create the necessary conditions â?? both in terms of organization and setting goals â?? to use the United Nations as a practical tool for finding ways to resolve contradictions and disputes among Member States without violence or war. We want both the Secretary-General and Member States to attend to this message. History has shown that every world order or system of international relations is always born out of the intolerable agony brought on by a major war or watershed event. Do we really need another major war or global calamity for our currently rudderless world to achieve some order? I am sure that none of us wants any such scenario. Belarus has proposed ways to address our fundamental global problems. We fully realize how audacious and unrealistic the idea of forging a renewed architecture for Eurasian-Atlantic cooperation and security may appear to many at this stage. We are willing to admit that our initial ideas about the outlines and, perhaps, the content of this process may be far from perfect. And it is possible that not everyone is ready to embrace Belarusâ??s notion of the importance of closer cooperation among regional integration processes. However, what we do firmly believe is that it is high time that we all came together to act urgently for the sake of peace and prosperity. I would like to conclude with a fitting quotation from Martin Luther King, Jr., who once said, â??Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: â??Too lateâ??.â?? We can still act to make sure that it will not be too late.",1,196
7722,Session 72 - 2017,BLZ_72_2017.txt,BLZ_72_2017,72,2017,BLZ,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Belize, I extend our heartfelt condolences to the populations of our sister countries in the Caribbean for the destruction and loss of life and property caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Belize stands united with other friendly countries of the world to assist and to render our full support to our sister countries and friends in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). I also extend Belizeâ??s warmest feelings of solidarity and sympathy to the people of Mexico, our immediate neighbours to the north, as they commence a difficult recovery process following the death and destruction caused by the two recent earthquakes. As you observed in your opening statement (see A/72/PV.3), Mr. President, you have assumed the presidency of the General Assembly at a most challenging time for multilateralism. Be assured nonetheless that my Government and people have every confidence in your leadership, and I pledge to you our full and active support as you embark on the task of addressing the agenda of the seventy-second session of the Assembly, focusing on people and striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. With regard to the Belizean experience, Belize celebrated its thirty-sixth year of independence on 21 September. In the 36 years since independence, we have matured into a unified nation, embracing all peoples in the fabric of our society and enjoying a peaceful existence. We have worked assiduously to uplift every Belizean, especially those who have been victims of anachronistic prejudices, and we have done so with an eye to ensuring that successive generations can benefit from the fruits of our labours and our natural resources. Our development has been modest in relative terms, but progressive and steady. We have readily embraced the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and launched our Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy for Belize 2016-2019, which incorporates the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement further complement the SDGs. We are already seeing the dividends of that early investment in policy and action. Belize has met several goals on road safety, marine protection and sustainable fisheries. These early accomplishments are mere benchmarks. We know that for our sustainable development, we must go above and beyond such accomplishments, so my Government is setting even more ambitious targets. At the Ocean Conference, we announced our commitment to further strengthening the legislative and regulatory framework on fisheries, increasing our marine reserves from 3 per cent to 10 per cent of our territorial waters and implementing legislation to curb the use of plastics. Among our ambitious climate-action contributions, Belize is committed to zero-emissions growth in its forestry sector and aims to achieve 85 per cent renewables in electricity production by 2027. In addition to our actions at the national level, we are also undertaking regional action by leveraging the strength of the Caribbean Community to optimize results for all our peoples by uniting our efforts aimed at fighting disease and security threats. Belize proudly hosted the launch of the CARICOM First Ladies and Spouses of Prime Ministers Network in support of the Implementation of SDG 5 and the Every Caribbean Woman, Every Caribbean Child initiative. Our leaders are also renewing and deepening efforts to tackle non-communicable diseases through targeted approaches aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles, starting with the youngest members of our communities. For our region, security and climate change are equally fundamental threats to our survival. The region has risen to meet these challenges by adopting its own counter-terrorism strategy and pioneering innovative approaches to building resilience and facilitating its transition to low- and no-carbon economies across the region. I will now address the challenges and opportunities of financing people-centred development. The cost of implementation is by no means negligible. At the national level, conservative estimates put the cost of implementation of our Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy at a quarter of Belizeâ??s gross domestic product. Belizeâ??s development finance strategy mirrors the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action. We are tapping into a mix of domestic and international resources through various channels, keeping in mind the inhospitable international policy environment. Domestically, my Government is strengthening its capacity to improve revenue collection. lncentivizing business investment in Belize is also a critical action point for my Government. Like other vulnerable small island developing States (SIDS), Belize saw a sharp decline in foreign direct investment over the period from 2015 to 2016. As of 2016, foreign direct investment flows to SIDS represented only 0.2 per cent of overall global flows. To buck this downward trend, we have reformed the incentives for doing business in Belize to comport with the policy space permitted by our World Trade Organization obligations. We have also reformed key institutions to ensure the integrity of our financial services industry. The Government has strengthened the institutional capacity, legislative framework and supervisory mandate of its financial intelligence unit. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force has determined that Belize is in compliance with international standards. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentâ??s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which at present sets international standards on tax cooperation, has listed Belize as a largely compliant tax jurisdiction, following Belize successful completion of the Global Forum peer review of its legislative, regulatory and administrative framework. In 2013, Belize adopted the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, the purpose of which is to facilitate cooperation among jurisdictions with a view to combating tax avoidance and evasion internationally. Additionally, Belize is committed to the Automatic Exchange of Information standard and has entered into 31 bilateral Exchange of Information agreements. Nevertheless, Belizeâ??s reputation, financial industry and economy remain vulnerable as a result of unilateral declarations that have labelled our jurisdiction as uncooperative or non-compliant. Such unilateral declarations cause undue damage to Belizeâ??s reputation and the integrity of its financial services industry. They also dissuade investors and undermine the significant legislative and administrative measures undertaken by our Government to ensure Belizeâ??s compliance with international standards and legal obligations. But even worse, they undermine the very legitimacy of the institutions that promulgate the global standards by which we are all supposed to be measured. In Belizeâ??s view, the United Nations must enforce the necessary checks and balances that are part of the international financial architecture. We see a role for the United Nations in acting as a central multilateral forum where efforts are consolidated and coherence and international cooperation promoted on issues that support domestic resource mobilization. Because of its universal nature, the United Nations is in the best position to foster a more inclusive, transparent and consultative process for addressing such issues as international cooperation on tax matters and the broader question of financing for sustainable development. Notwithstanding our best efforts, we cannot meet the costs of implementation with our domestic resources alone. We rely on our bilateral partners from the North and the South. We have also developed strong working relationships with multilateral development banks. But with our current status as a middle-income country, our access to grant and concessional financing is severely constrained. Belize is in the unenviable position of being a heavily indebted middle-income country. Our external public debt stands at 70 per cent of our gross domestic product, or $2.3 billion, and the domestic debt at 22 per cent of gross domestic product, or $750 million. The cost of interest for these debt obligations is $109 million for the current fiscal year alone. Without viable alternatives, my Government has to finance its development by contracting loans at market rates. My Government has endeavoured to appeal to our private creditors to renegotiate the onerous bonds that threaten to upend the sustainability of our debt. However, the world of international private finance does not place a high priority on public policy, much less the public policy of a foreign Government. With the ongoing crises resulting from the withdrawal of correspondent banking services from relationships with our indigenous financial institutions, the entire Caribbean is experiencing this reality. To the likes of Bank of America or JPMorgan Chase it matters not that ending correspondent banking relations with a national bank or a central bank effectively excludes that nation from the global financial system, and, in response, the country where those banks are located offers nothing more than sympathy. That is a major concern, not just for the Caribbean but for all developing countries, given the universal pivot towards the private sector financing the development agenda. It would behoove the United Nations to develop a participatory framework for the private sector in order to keep account of their commitments made and actions taken to advance global goals. The High-level Political Forum offers a useful platform for integrating such a framework. The United Nations should also develop appropriate capacities to track the alignment of private financial flows with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is also incumbent on the United Nations to accelerate progress in redefining development metrics to respond to the anomaly of heavily indebted middle-income countries, particularly those with unique challenges, such as small island developing States. Belize welcomes the Secretary-Generalâ??s commitment to SIDS. I would like to take this opportunity to commend him and you, Mr. President, for holding a special session on Hurricane Irma. I wish to extend my own Governmentâ??s pledge of solidarity to the members of our Caribbean family that were devastated by that unprecedented storm and, more recently, by Hurricane Maria. Hurricanes Irma and Maria have exposed the acute humanitarian challenge and the equally acute development challenge that SIDS face. That challenge is, without question, a global one, as the Secretary- General has rightly stated. We look forward to engaging in action-oriented discussions in order to facilitate piloting such financing-for-sustainable-development initiatives across SIDS as debt swaps for climate action and the expansion of climate risk insurance, and to support adaptation measures at individual to national levels. The United Nations can serve as a global incubator for genuine and durable multi-stakeholder partnerships that can foster innovation and entrepreneurship in SIDS. At the national level, we are ready to engage in discussions on how to ensure that the United Nations is fit for our countryâ??s purposes on the ground as we aim to implement the ambitious 2030 Agenda and develop country-specific solutions for sustainable financing. Belize fully agrees with the Secretary-General that the United Nations has a crucial role to play as a catalyst, an innovator, a convenor and a champion of what works. Since its inception, the United Nations has been orchestrating a rules-based framework for helping countries to cooperate and take collective action. As we embrace a new era of openness, transparency and accountability, United Nations operations must also reflect the openness, transparency and accountability of all who engage and benefit from international cooperation. We depend on the United Nations to champion and protect the rule of law, ensure the universality of core agreements and develop new treaties in order to address gaps where they exist. That is why Belize looks to the United Nations as a firewall between democracy and tyranny, between social justice and oppression, and between the global good and self-interest. Its ultimate role is to protect the interests of humankind as a whole. In this spirit, we expect the United Nations to act, and we therefore insist that the overdue reforms of the peace and security architecture of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, be completed forthwith so that there can be no obstacle to action. Belize has long supported the United Nations in fulfilling its role. We have supported its endeavours to forge new partnerships for development, advance global health policies, bring justice to victims of crimes against humanity, protect the most vulnerable and control the spread of weapons of mass destruction, including small arms and light weapons. We have been at the forefront of the global fight to protect and preserve our shared natural environment against environmental degradation and climate change and to ensure the sustainable use of the planet, especially of our oceans, which sustain life on earth. Through the Caribbean Community, we are also leading the charge to deliver reparations to the victims of slavery and their descendants. For Belize, as a State Member of the United Nations, advocating for peaceful cooperation among States, the right to self-determination for all peoples and the promotion and protection of human rights is a non-derogable duty. We therefore cannot remain silent wherever injustice persists. We see injustice perpetrated against the people of Taiwan, who uphold the core purposes and principles of the United Nations, while, in contrast, the United Nations fails to uphold those purposes and principles with respect to them. For more than half a century, the people of Cuba have been the victims of the injustice of an egregious and illegal unilateral embargo. We also see injustice continuing to cast a shadow over the peoples of Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara and South Sudan, among others. The situation in Venezuela is one that continues to challenge all of us in our region and hemisphere. Belize fully subscribes to the position of CARICOM, which underscores respect for international law and international principles and urges resolution through dialogue. To that end, CARICOM has offered its own good offices. In our region, we continue to witness the suffering of our Haitian brothers and sisters. Belize cannot remain silent in the face of such intolerable injustice, nor should the rest of the world. We support United Nations efforts aimed at bringing justice to all who have been alienated, oppressed, victimized or silenced. When we fail to uphold our duty to the norms and values of the United Nations, humankind itself suffers. But when we defend those norms and values, there is no greater redemption. The Haitian people know this fact all too well, and, with good reason, they look hopefully towards the new United Nations approach to cholera in Haiti and the establishment of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. Similarly, when Belizeâ??s territorial integrity was at issue, Belize turned to the United Nations to defend the countryâ??s sovereignty over its land, and, for as long as we have been a dutiful Member State, we have had peace. We want that peace to endure, so we have taken every possible step to bring Guatemala to the table of justice in order to resolve that countryâ??s unfounded claim on our territory. In 2008, Belize and Guatemala agreed to refer the Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory to the International Court of Justice, the Organizationâ??s judicial arm, subject to the will of each of our peoples. Both Belize and Guatemala are poised to hold the requisite referendums to obtain our peoplesâ?? consent. In the meantime, with the full support of the Organization of American States, we continue to take a constructive approach to our bilateral relations and to maintaining peace along the borders. Belize remains committed to working with Guatemala to finalize a cooperation mechanism for the Sarstoon River in order to minimize the potential for tensions or incidents along Belizeâ??s southern border. In conclusion, for the past 36 years, we Belizeans have lived in harmony with one another and with nature. Together with our leaders and with the support of other friendly nations, we have built a strong nation by the sweat of our brows. We have honoured our Constitution, which enshrines the principle of social, economic and environmental justice for all. We will persevere in our efforts to achieve our just objectives and look to the United Nations for its continued support. In turn, the United Nations and every Member State can rest assured that Belize will defend our community of nations and its purposes and principles. Our national motto is â??Sub umbra floreoâ?? â?? â??In the shade I flourishâ??. In the shade of the United Nations, we shall all flourish.",1,196
7723,Session 72 - 2017,BOL_72_2017.txt,BOL_72_2017,72,2017,BOL,"On behalf of the people of Bolivia, I wish to express our full solidarity with the people of Mexico. Alarmed by this afternoonâ??s earthquake, we extend our support and brotherhood to Mexico as it addresses the resulting problems. Once again, as leaders of the world we have gathered here in the historic Hall of the General Assembly. We meet yet again to voice our positions on the major challenges facing our family â?? the human family. The United Nations, as set forth in its Charter, was established to save succeeding generations from war, promote social progress and improve the standard of living of all peoples. Unfortunately, many of those promises have come to nothing, and after more than 70 years we see that in many instances, instead of making progress towards those objectives, we have regressed. As we have affirmed many times, due to the abusive practices of imperialism, the market of savage consumption that supports capitalism and endless colonialist adventures, the world is enduring a multiplicity of crises that, instead of being resolved, are growing worse. War and violent conflict remain the scourge of millions of people. External aggressions in Iraq have led to more than a million deaths to date. In Syria, almost half a million people have lost their lives. In Libya, tens of thousands have been killed. In Yemen, the humanitarian crisis is of great proportions. History has shown that, in order to appropriate natural resources and control the world geopolitically, military bases are deployed, invasions are organized, and Governments are brought down to create chaos and take advantage of the situation. Many of these invasions have fuelled the emergence of terrorist groups and unleashed violent confrontations and attacks on civilian populations, causing even more harm to innocent victims. Bolivia condemns terrorism and calls for fighting it and for resolving the structural causes of its emergence. To this terrible situation is added the climatic crisis. We note that this year has again been the hottest in the history of the planet. Hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, pollution of the air and oceans and the consequent extinction of species are results of the capitalist model, consumption levels and excessive industrialization. In this situation, the countries of the South, which pollute the least, are the ones that suffer the most. It is imperative that all our countries join the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to work together to address the enormous challenges involved in saving the planet. It is unjustifiable and inadmissible that the United States has decided to turn its back on the Paris Agreement. As one of the worldâ??s main polluters, its Government, by refusing to do its part in the global effort, has become a threat to Mother Earth. What is necessary is unequivocal political will. We cannot expect market forces to finally convince the leaders of the capitalist world to take action. We extend our embrace of solidarity to our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean who are suffering the consequences of the passage of hurricanes. Together, as a united family, we will share with them what we have, even if it is not enough. Our rivers, our seas, our forests and science have given us irrefutable evidence and call upon us to act. Water is the blood of Mother Earth that gives life to rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, which in turn are a source of life and generate balance. They are universal commons that cover three-quarters of our home. They bathe everything on all continents and islands of the Earth. They do this naturally, with no regard for political borders or nationalities. They should be respected, cared for, shared and preserved for future generations. Bolivia has promoted the recognition that water is a human right. It is essential for the survival of humankind. Accordingly, our Constitution also prohibits it from being the used for profit or commercialism. The use of water must lead the way to opportunities that promote collaboration, interaction and harmony among peoples, not to cause conflicts over its origin, ownership or use. It is in this spirit of safeguarding human rights and sovereign rights related to our natural resources and in pursuit of good-neighbourly agreements that Bolivia hopes to resolve its Silala water dispute, which has been brought to the International Court of Justice. Water should not be the cause of internal or international conflicts. It must bring together and unite all States, nations, communities, peoples, social movements and individuals. For Bolivia, which is the hydrographic heart of South America, this concept is very important. Where water flows, peace must flow. Not only is the world growing warmer every year, but each succeeding year is growing more unfair and more unequal. The gap between those who have the most â?? everything â?? and those who have almost nothing is widening every day. According to the most recent report from Oxfam, eight people have the same amount of wealth as 3.6 billion people, that is, half of the population of the planet. Inequality is immoral. If 800 million people suffer from hunger, it is not because there is a lack of food. If millions of children die from infection, it is not because there is a lack of medicine. If 1.1 billion people do not have electricity, it is not because of a lack of energy in the world. If there is illiteracy, it is not because there are no books. If there are poor people in the world, it is not because there are no resources. Due to war, terrorism and other conflicts, we are experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis since the founding of the United Nations. More than 128 million people in 33 countries require humanitarian assistance. More than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced. More than 22 million are refugees, which is the highest number ever recorded in the human history. More than 10 million people are stateless. This calls for our attention. Bolivia condemns the construction of walls and laws that seek to criminalize migration. Accordingly, we propose the creation of a universal citizenship. The social and immigration crisis has its origin in the dominant world order, with its limitless greed for profit and appropriation of the commons, produces violence, promotes inequalities and destroys Mother Earth. Migrants cannot be held responsible for the economic and financial crises or 17-29281 15/24 for insecurity. We must not allow them to be viewed as criminals either. No migrant is illegal. Some Governments, far from helping to resolve the structural causes of this phenomenon, such as war, the consequences of climate change or the economic asymmetries among the States, proclaim greater restrictions in their migration policies, massive expulsions and the building of walls. Walls counter the history of humankind. Walls cripple science and knowledge. Walls confine our souls, fuel hatred of difference and stifle freedom. In Tiquipaya, Bolivia, representatives of social movements from 45 countries around the world came together at the World Peoplesâ?? Conference in June for a world without walls towards universal citizenship. At that conference, we drafted alternative proposals with a humanist vision to welcome, protect, promote and integrate migrants. In August, Pope Francis dedicated a pastoral document to those four verbs. We too call on the Governments of the world to come together to tackle criminal networks that traffic in human beings by declaring the trade and traffick in human beings as a crime against humanity and by considering the formation of a world ombudsman as an authority of universal jurisdiction responsible for ensuring human rights. Once again, I call for a global pact to act as the bridge to move towards the universal citizenship that we desire, because there are no categories and there are no differences between nationals and foreigners. We are all human beings and children of Mother Earth. The United States of America must unilaterally and unconditionally put an end to the unjust embargo that has caused so much suffering to the Cuban people for nearly 60 years. It is an unjust and failed policy, and must be abandoned. The recent actions announced by President Trump spell a resurgence in the financial and trade embargo against Cuba and reverse the progress made between the two nations. The United States must not only lift that criminal embargo, but also make economic reparations for the damage caused and return GuantÃ¡namo to Cuban sovereignty. I pay deepest tribute to the memories of Commander Fidel and Commander Che Guevara, who from this very rostrum warned us not to trust imperialism. We welcome the peace process in Colombia, including the consolidation of the ceasefire, disarmament and the integration of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia into political life. Revolutions take place through the ballot box and social consensus, not through bullets. Latin America and the Caribbean are coming together as a region of peace. Bolivia unequivocally condemns the unilateral sanctions and the threats of invasion levelled by the Government of the United States against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Our region is nobodyâ??s back yard. We also reject the conduct of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, who is the spokesperson for anti-Latin American interests. We express our support for and solidarity with President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and the Venezuelan people. We welcome and support the ongoing democratic dialogue. For Bolivia, the Palestinian cause is indisputable. We condemn the criminal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. We condemn the construction of new settlements, and we condemn military aggression against the Palestinian people. We demand the achievement of a two-State solution and the establishment of a Palestinian State withing the pre- 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. We condemn the unilateral and illegal military actions of the United States in deploying its forces in the Syrian Arab Republic. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Kazakhstan in seeking a ceasefire and in contributing to the peace negotiations process. We believe that if it were not for interventionism, we would not be suffering that war. Bolivia condemns the production, development and use of all nuclear and chemical weapons, which pose a serious threat to peace, security and human life itself. We demand that all military interventions be avoided in resolving the situation in the Korean peninsula, and that negotiations be resumed as soon as possible to resolve that conflict peacefully. It is clear that the main threat to mother Earth, multilateralism, peace and freedom is the Government of the United States of America. It is my duty to describe the economic and social situation of my country. Bolivia has consolidated an economic model that has successfully coped with the global crisis of the capitalist system. Bolivia leads economic growth in our region. We have recovered our homeland. Bolivia is a land that is free of illiteracy, free of North American military bases, free of the Drug 16/24 17-29281 Enforcement Administration and free of the United States Agency for International Development. It is a land free of impositions by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Over the past decade, we have reduced extreme poverty from 38.2 per cent to 16.8 per cent, and we will eradicate it by 2025. We have reduced inequality. In 2005, the wealthiest 10 per cent held 128 times more wealth than the poorest 10 per cent; now, the wealthiest 10 per cent hold 46 times more wealth than the poorest 10 per cent. Bolivia ranks second in the world among the countries with the most women in Parliament. We are committed to multilateralism, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts. In 2003, Bolivia came before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, seeking a peaceful solution to its unresolved 100-year-old dispute with the Republic of Chile that would allow us to exercise our right to sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. We seek a solution that will satisfy both the historical and legislative background and the future understanding between neighbourly and fraternal peoples through an opportune and effective negotiation in good faith. We trust in the Courtâ??s decision and in a process of dialogue and negotiation that, unlike the invasions that we have suffered in the past, will help us to overcome our differences and promote our complementarity, free and sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and the proper use of our shared natural resources. We are grateful for the solidarity shown by many States, peoples and leaders who have expressed their support for our maritime cause. I take this opportunity to ask all participants in the Assembly to accompany us in our peaceful quest for justice. It is anunwavering challenge for the brotherhood of our people over the coming generations. With every passing year, our challenges become greater. War continues to destroy cities and global warming is a growing threat. If we truly want to resolve those issues and defend the interests of our peoples, it is essential to recognize basic services as human rights, respect the rights of Mother Earth and take up the fight against capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. Only if we win that fight will there be an authentic global order, based on solidarity, equality and social justice and respect for the right of peoples to peace and development so that they can live comfortably.",1,196
7724,Session 72 - 2017,BRA_72_2017.txt,BRA_72_2017,72,2017,BRA,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. You can count on the continued support of the Brazilian delegation. I am also pleased to greet the Secretary-General in our common language, Portuguese. I once again wish the Secretary-General enduring success during his tenure. The challenges faced by the United Nations since its creation have been manifold. Additionally, we all know that the aspirations of its founders have not been fully realized. However, the truth is that over the past 72 years, the United Nations has always represented and continues to represent hope. The truth is that the United Nations has always represented and continues to represent the possibility of a fairer world; a world of peace and prosperity; a world in which no one should face discrimination, oppression and poverty; a world in which production and consumption patterns are compatible with the well-being of present and future generations. The United Nations has established itself as a privileged forum to build the world to which we aspire. In order to build that world, we need proper methods and a sense of realism, all without ever losing sight of our ideals. At the current moment in history, which features such distinct uncertainty and instability, there is a clear need for more diplomacy and more negotiation, not less. We need more multilateralism and dialogue, not less. We certainly need more of the United Nations. We need the United Nations to be increasingly legitimate and effective. It is for that reason that, along with many other countries, we uphold the imperative of reforming the United Nations. It is particularly necessary to enlarge the Security Council in order to adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century. It is urgent that we listen to the will of the overwhelming majority of the General Assembly. One should not assume that ideas that have proved erroneous in the past may now yield good results. We reject exacerbated forms of nationalism. We do not believe in protectionism as a solution to economic challenges. Those challenges actually require effective responses to the root causes of social exclusion. The pursuit of development in all its dimensions should guide our collective action. Brazilâ??s commitment to sustainable development is our top priority. It permeates our public policies and our actions abroad. During our chairmanship of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, for instance, we made the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the driving blueprint for our efforts in that forum. On all fronts, Brazil has sought to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Combating climate change is a necessary part of that contribution. We stand committed to supporting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Last year, I submitted the Brazilian instrument of ratification of the Agreement. There is no possibility of postponing action in the sphere of tackling climate change. We must act now. I am proud to say that my country is leading the way towards a low-carbon economy. Clean and renewable energy sources account for more than 40 per cent of the Brazilian energy portfolio, which is three times more than the global average. We are leaders in hydroelectricity and bioenergy. Brazil is proud to have the worldâ??s highest tropical forest cover. Deforestation is a matter of concern, especially in the Amazon. We have been drawing attention and allocating resources to that issue. Some good news is that data from the past year point to a reduction of more than 20 per cent in deforestation in the Amazonian region. We are on the right track and on that track we shall remain. Another key factor of development is trade. We are committed to an open and rules-based international trade system, with the World Trade Organization and its dispute-settlement mechanism at its centre. At the upcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, to be held in Buenos Aires in December, we will once again have to face up to long-standing issues, which have proved detrimental mainly to developing countries. We will have to make progress on market access to agricultural products and on eliminating agricultural subsidies that distort trade. We believe that, together, we will succeed in achieving concrete results. All these efforts contribute to the accomplishment of our main objective: to ensure opportunities for all, everywhere. Tomorrow, I will have the honour of signing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Brazil was among the drafters of the Treaty. It will be a historic moment. We reiterate our call for the nuclear Powers to undertake additional disarmament obligations. In this regard, Brazil expresses itself with the authority of a country that, while mastering nuclear technology, has voluntarily given up possessing nuclear weapons. Brazil expresses itself with the authority of a country whose own Constitution prohibits the use of nuclear technology for non-peaceful purposes; a country that was at the origin of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which, half a century ago, established the denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean; a country that, along with its South American and African neighbours, has turned the South Atlantic into a nuclear-weapon-free zone; lastly, a country that, along with Argentina, created a binational nuclear safeguards mechanism, which has become a benchmark for the world at large. As we welcome the achievement represented by the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, we must acknowledge that there are lingering issues of serious concern on the peace and security agenda. The recent nuclear and missile tests on the Korean peninsula constitute a serious threat to which none of us can be indifferent. Brazil condemns these acts in the strongest possible terms. We must urgently seek a peaceful resolution to the current situation, whose consequences are unimaginable. In the Middle East, talks between Israel and Palestine remain at a standstill. As a friend of both Palestinians and Israelis, Brazil continues to support the solution of two States living side by side in peace and security, within internationally recognized and mutually agreed borders. In Syria, despite the de-escalation of recent months, we are still witnessing a conflict with tragic humanitarian consequences. The solution that must be sought in Syria is essentially political in nature and can no longer be postponed. Similarly, in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Mali and the Central African Republic, wars have caused intolerable suffering that extends beyond borders. Let us visit the refugee and displaced person camps in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Kenya. Let us listen to the stories of those who have lost fathers, mothers, sons and daughters. These families have been engulfed by the irrationality of conflicts that seem to know no limits, conflicts that result in violations of humanitarian law with unacceptable frequency. Our Secretary-General is right. We should reinvigorate the mechanisms of conflict prevention. Prevention is about diplomacy. It is about development. It is crucial to recognize the nexus between security and development. This recognition has guided Brazilâ??s participation in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). As MINUSTAH concludes its mandate, the international community must maintain its commitment to the Haitian people. Brazil certainly will do so. In South America, Colombia is ending more than 50 years of conflict. Brazil will continue to be a resolute partner in this effort. From Barcelona to Kabul, from Alexandria to Manchester, repeated demonstrations of cowardly violence do not let us forget the evil of terrorism. This evil feeds on fundamentalism and exclusion, and no country is immune to it. Unity is crucial, particularly in view of the capacity of terrorism to adapt to new ages and environments. We will not be frightened by terror, nor will we allow it to weaken our belief in freedom and tolerance. In many of our countries, transnational crime also undermines the security and tranquillity of individuals and families. Only through coordination and collaboration will we effectively combat trafficking in persons, arms and drugs, and money-laundering. It was in this spirit that Brazil organized, in November 2016, a ministerial meeting of South American countries on border security, and it is in this spirit that we will continue cooperating with countries around the world to tackle organized crime. Regrettably, human rights violations remain frequent throughout the world â?? both violations of civil and political rights, as well as of economic, social and cultural rights. We must ensure that every individual everywhere can live with dignity, according to his or her convictions and choices. Brazil is a country of deep-rooted liberties, which was and is still being built on a foundation of diversity â?? diversity of ethnicity, culture, creed and thought. More than anything, it is from this diversity that we draw our strength as a nation. We reject racism, xenophobia and all other forms of discrimination. We are party to the main international human rights treaties and members of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court. We have extended a standing invitation to United Nations special rapporteurs. Today we have one of the most modern refugee laws in the world. We have just updated our immigration law, guided by the principle of humanitarian reception. We have granted humanitarian visas to Haitian and Syrian citizens and we have welcomed thousands of migrants and refugees from Venezuela. The human rights situation in Venezuela continues to deteriorate. We are on the side of the Venezuelan people, with whom we share a fraternal bond. In South America, there is no longer room for alternatives to democracy. This is what we have stated in MERCOSUR and what we will continue to uphold. Brazil is going through a moment of decisive transformation. With structural reforms, we are overcoming an unprecedented economic crisis. We are recovering our fiscal balance, and with it, the credibility of our economy. We are once again creating jobs. We are recovering the Stateâ??s capacity to implement social policies that are indispensable to a country like ours. We have learned and are applying this elementary rule in practice: without fiscal responsibility, social responsibility is nothing more than empty words. The new Brazil that is emerging from these reforms is a country that is more open to the world. That is the attitude of openness that we bring to the United Nations, as well as to MERCOSUR; the Group of 20; the Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa group of countries; the India, Brazil and South Africa group of countries; and to all forums in which we participate. It is the attitude of openness that we have adopted towards each of our partners in our region and beyond it. South America is our immediate neighbour. For that reason, we have worked for a prosperous and democratic South America. We have worked for an increasing convergence of the integration processes in Latin America and the Caribbean. A significant example thereof are the present closer ties between the Southern Common Market and the Pacific Alliance. Together, the countries of these two different groups constitute a market of almost 470 million people, which accounts for over 90 per cent of Latin Americaâ??s gross domestic product. Africa, in turn, is a continent with which we are associated by strong historical and cultural ties. Africa is a continent where we wish to have both increasing cooperation initiatives and partnerships for development. With regard to Europe, we have cultivated long-standing friendships and we have worked to boost trade and investment flows there. Likewise in Asia and the Pacific region â?? the most dynamic hub of the global economy â?? we have stepped up our relations with both traditional partners and with new ones. We have also opened up new trade fronts with Asia and the Pacific. This has been our foreign policy â?? a truly universalist foreign policy. And the fact is that the General Assembly is the most universal of all forums we have and can count on. Here, we can all benefit from the broadest and most pluralistic array of perspectives. Here, we find the parameters and standards that govern respectful coexistence. And here our nations shall become more united, and aim at the ultimate development of our peoples, the dignity of our citizens and the security of our planet.",1,196
7725,Session 72 - 2017,BRB_72_2017.txt,BRB_72_2017,72,2017,BRB,"On behalf of my delegation, I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy- second session and to assure him that he has the full support and cooperation of the Barbados delegation as he undertakes his important duties. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend his predecessor in the presidency, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his able leadership of the Assembly during the seventy-first session. He has been a worthy exemplar of the valuable contribution that small island developing States (SIDS) can make to international organizations, and we are pleased that he will continue to serve the international community. The theme of this yearâ??s general debate, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is a reminder of the purposes and principles that the Organization has embraced from its inception and that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It brings into sharp focus our responsibility to pursue the best interests of the people who occupy planet Earth. For if we fail to advance the causes of security, sustainable development and human rights together, none of them will succeed. I stand before this organ for the eighth time. On each occasion that I have addressed the nations gathered here, I have issued a caution about the ramifications of unchecked climate change and highlighted the existential threat facing vulnerable small island developing States such as Barbados. In his first address to the General Assembly, in 2008 (see A/63/PV.12), the then Prime Minister of Barbados, the late David Thompson, described the Caribbean as a region at the epicentre of the global climate crisis. Citing scientific evidence and the devastating effects of climate change that were already evident in the region, he told the Assembly that failure to take urgent, ambitious and decisive action would be nothing short of reckless indifference. Seven years later, the current Prime Minister of Barbados, Mr. Freundel Stuart, reminded the world that â??none of the nations represented in this Assembly will enjoy sustainable prosperity if we continue to abuse the environment that we hold in sacred trust for future generations. [...] The very existence of small island States like those in the Caribbean and the Pacific could be imperilled if current trends are not halted or reversed.â?? (A/66/PV.22, p. 45) Many leaders from small island developing States have also consistently warned of the inherent danger of inaction, or insufficient action, to reduce global emissions. Such failures to act imperil lives, livelihoods and the very existence of sovereign States. Year after year, our leaders have warned of the escalating costs of responding to the effects of climate change and of the fact that decades of development gains could easily be washed away in a few hours by an extreme weather event. We have also endured the persistent and frustrating challenge of gaining access to the resources we need to strengthen our resilience and protect our peoples from the ravages of climate change. That is of course owing to a narrow focus on per capita income on the part of donors and international development banks and agencies. The clarion call from the Caribbean has been ignored, and today we are witnessing the results of that reckless indifference. I regret the fact that I must today report not merely the potential threat that climate change poses to the globe, but rather its destructive impact. I am referring in particular to the utter devastation that we are seeing in several small island developing States in the Caribbean that have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of hurricanes. On Saturday, 16 September, when I arrived in New York, the people of Antigua and Barbuda and of the Caribbean were working feverishly to restore some semblance of order to the islands shattered by Irma, the ninth named hurricane of the 2017 season. A mere two days later, in the early hours of Monday, I read with horror the pleas of the Prime Minister of Dominica when he reached out to the world to share the trauma he was experiencing as his small island was ravaged by the brutal force of nature from the eleventh hurricane in a season that has not yet ended. By the grace of God, Barbados has so far been spared, but we in the Caribbean are one family. We are brothers and sisters, and when one of us is hurting we all feel the pain. For much of the Caribbean, tourism is the major economic sector, and it has been built on the premise of providing the world with a zone of peace and health. The threat of disease must be avoided. One possible consequence of the recent floods and serious infrastructural damage in the region is the outbreak of disease. Our ability to detect and respond to such biological threats must be strengthened. There must be bilateral and multilateral cooperation in order to minimize and eliminate such threats, and a focus on biosecurity must be part of our response. There must be attention paid to a global health security agenda. For Barbados, as an island State, the ocean is a priority. Ocean governance and the promotion and conservation of marine resources therefore represent one of our primary concerns. The road to recovery and reconstruction for Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and the other islands affected by this devastating hurricane season will be long and difficult. I take comfort in the spirit, will and determination of the Caribbean people. We are down but not defeated. Our neighbours in the Caribbean affected by the recent hurricanes can be assured of the full and unconditional support and solidarity of the Government and the people of Barbados. However, our friends in the international community must support the Caribbean region on its journey to rebuild the affected islands. We are all morally obligated to do so. In that regard, I call on the President of the World Bank and on the Secretary-General to convene an international pledging conference on the recovery and reconstruction of the Caribbean islands affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. I urge all Member States to support the recovery and rebuilding of the Caribbean. For Barbados and other SIDS, whether in the Caribbean, the Pacific, Asia or Africa, climate change is a matter of life and death. It is not an issue for sterile debates and endless meetings. For our people, it is about the loss of life and livelihood. For our economies, heavily dependent on tourism, it is about a cycle of constant recovery and rebuilding, which is a serious impediment to sustainable development. Barbados remains committed to ambitious action on climate change. We continue to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we view the Secretary-Generalâ??s proposal for a climate summit in 2019 as an important opportunity to take stock and give additional impetus where necessary. Barbadosâ??s support for global action on climate change is one part of its overall policy of promoting and protecting the environment. We have taken concrete steps towards building a resource-efficient green economy that is integrated into our national framework for sustainable development. Barbados would like to take this opportunity to convey its solidarity with the Government and the people of Mexico, who are suffering the painful effects of two deadly earthquakes in quick succession. A key element of this yearâ??s theme is striving for peace. Barbados is a democratic, peace-loving nation. Last year my country celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence, which was gained through negotiation and mutual agreement. We cherish and nurture our political and social stability, based on our history of more than 375 years of unbroken parliamentary Government. We believe that peace is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable human, social and economic development. For us, it is an essential pillar that supports the national mission of the Government of Barbados, which is based on achieving sustainable economic and social development for the nation, protecting the environment, maintaining good governance and strengthening our citizensâ?? security. We are committed to inclusive development as a means of achieving lasting peace and stability at the national and international levels. We regret that there can be no peace of mind for the people of the Caribbean who must rebuild their lives and livelihoods. But the mission of the United Nations is to secure global peace. We were reminded by the Secretary-General at the very start of our deliberations that â??[w]e are a world in pieces. We need to be a world at peaceâ?? (see A/72/PV.3). Each and every member of the international community has an obligation to support efforts and take action to create an environment in which peace can flourish. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have declared the Caribbean as a zone of peace. I take this opportunity to express Barbadosâ??s unwavering support to the protection and preservation of the territorial integrity of our Caribbean Community sister countries Guyana and Belize. Barbados joins other States Members of the United Nations in the effort to collectively address the many other diverse challenges to which the international community must find and implement solutions. In the past few years, the countries represented here have made historic international commitments, including the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Change Agreement. As an international community, we must now take action to implement those commitments if the destruction I discussed earlier in my statement is to be addressed. In recognition of the fact that our citizens are our most precious resource, we have been resolute in taking a path of development that is people-centred. Our national policy framework aligns naturally with the philosophy guiding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that has facilitated our implementation efforts. The Prime Minister of Barbados has clearly emphasized the priority that Barbados accords the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including by appointing a permanent secretary in his office with a mandate and special responsibility to lead the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level. Barbados has been a consistent and vocal advocate for the treatment of SIDS as a special case for sustainable development because of their inherent natural vulnerabilities. There is a pressing need for the international community to address the specific needs and interests of SIDS in a holistic manner. They will also need effective multisectoral partnerships to assist them in implementing the SDGs. Barbados welcomes the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to focus international attention on challenges to our oceans and on encouraging the international community to take meaningful steps to protect the marine environment. I was pleased to head the Barbados delegation to the Ocean Conference in June, and I am committed to ensuring our continued active participation on the issue. Barbados is interested in working with United Nations agencies and other international partners to develop an ocean economy trade strategy, as well as effective systems for managing our fish stocks. Barbados has built an enviable record on the basis of its promotion of social development. Since our independence, successive Administrations have committed to targeted social policies focused on the people of Barbados. Substantial investment has been made in sectors such as education and health in order to develop a skilled, healthy and productive population. The result of that investment has been a significant improvement in Barbadiansâ?? quality of life over the years, borne out in the United Nations Development Programmeâ??s Human Development Index and other indices that focus on transparency, corruption, gender balance and human rights, among other things. Promoting and protecting the human rights of all Barbadians are primary concerns for the Government of Barbados. That is in keeping with our commitment to a human rights-based approach to development and our adherence to the principles of good governance and the rule of law, as well as to ensuring that our people have the highest levels of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. We pay special attention to the rights of the vulnerable, including children, women and persons with disabilities. With regard to the rights of persons with disabilities, my Government, together with civil society, continues to make progress in promoting their full integration into mainstream society. Barbados wishes to participate more fully in the activities of the international community on issues of inclusiveness, and are therefore pleased to present Ms. Kerryann Ifill as a candidate for membership of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the 2019-2022 term. Senator Ifill is the youngest President of the Senate ever appointed in Barbados, the first female and the first person with a disability ever to hold that office, and her candidature has been endorsed by the Caribbean Community. The Caribbean Community has been at the forefront of United Nations initiatives to address the problem of non-communicable diseases. During this session, Barbados will work with regional and other partners to bring a greater focus to the growing challenge of childhood obesity, a serious problem that could become the next major development challenge. Barbados looks forward to the convening of the General Assemblyâ??s third high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases, scheduled for next year. I encourage Member States to participate actively in it, as it will be an invaluable opportunity to strengthen our action on this important issue and move closer to our goal of improved health for our peoples. Barbados would like to take this opportunity to once again express its deep concern about the possibility of its being penalized for any success that it may achieve in its development efforts. Our categorization as a middle-income country, with the concomitant restrictions on our access to international development assistance and concessionary financing, is unfair and does nothing to advance the cause of sustainable development. We reiterate our call to the international community to create an enabling global environment and partnership for development. Countries such as mine require assistance in building economic resilience; we do not need challenges such as those presented by de-risking, blacklisting and indebtedness. Transnational crime is a major threat to international peace and security. It can take many forms â?? trafficking in illegal drugs, trafficking in persons, the illegal transfer of small arms and light weapons, and money- laundering. All present significant threats to our security, and Barbados reiterates its commitment to protecting the security of its people. We will remain actively engaged in cooperative mechanisms aimed at confronting and addressing such challenges. Barbados welcomes the convening of the third Conference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). We encourage all States parties to take action to implement the Treaty and we further acknowledge the nexus between the ATT and the Sustainable Development Goals, and their contribution to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies. The long-standing economic embargo on Cuba continues to be a cause for serious concern on Barbadosâ??s part. We join the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations in opposing that unilateral action and encourage constructive engagement between the two sides. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize Barbadosâ??s unwavering commitment to the United Nations and the principle of multilateralism. If we are truly committed to a decent life for all, people everywhere must be heard, including those in small States such as Barbados. We agree that there is need for reform in the United Nations system. However, even as the United Nations is working to reform, and thereby better equip itself to respond to todayâ??s global challenges, due care must be taken to ensure that the process is inclusive and transparent. No Member State, particularly the most vulnerable, should be excluded in the restructuring process. Barbados supports the view that a spirit of cooperation and dialogue should be the foundation for our interaction at the multilateral level. Cooperation and dialogue represent the best means of achieving our international goals and objectives.",1,196
7726,Session 72 - 2017,BRN_72_2017.txt,BRN_72_2017,72,2017,BRN,"I have the great honour to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam to the General Assembly. We congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at this session. We also thank His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, who presided over the Assembly with such dedication during the past year. I also wish to send my warm wishes to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, and to praise him for his vision for strengthening our Organization. Two years ago, Brunei Darussalam proudly joined everyone in embarking on an extended journey to achieve a global set of ambitious goals for sustainable development. For us, that moment was meaningful. It signified our Organizationâ??s relentless efforts to bring development and prosperity to all countries, regardless of their size and status in the world. It also showed us what unity can accomplish. Our theme sums up who it is we are acting for â?? it is our people. It is therefore important to ensure that we fulfil our promise to them. It is a promise of a future where their hopes and dreams for better livelihoods can be realized. That will require our long-term commitment and significant investment. In Brunei Darussalam, this means more than just building infrastructure or providing for basic needs. It also means raising decent people, people who care for their society and are committed to their countryâ??s development and future. That calls for an inclusive approach, with a priority of focusing on youth development. In todayâ??s increasingly competitive environment, Brunei Darussalam firmly believes that quality education is the key to building a new generation of highly skilled, innovative and confident young people. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 291 million people around the world are estimated to be unemployed this year. Creating job opportunities, especially for our young people, will therefore be crucial to raising their standard of living. In Brunei Darussalam, we are continuing our efforts to diversify our economy and advocate free trade bilaterally and regionally, with the aim of achieving a dynamic and sustainable economy. While pursuing economic progress, we should be mindful of the correlation between human activities and climate change. That is where the Paris Agreement on Climate Change can galvanize our collective actions to bequeath a cleaner, healthier, safer and more sustainable planet to our future generations. Brunei Darussalam will continue to do what it can to contribute positively towards that end. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are promoting efficiency in energy consumption and gradually deploying renewable energies. At the same time, conserving our forests is a high priority, and that complements our multilateral efforts, including the Heart of Borneo initiative and, recently, the Queenâ??s Commonwealth Canopy. All in all, it is about educating our people to care for and protect our planet. And strengthening global efforts in that area is also important. For human and economic development to thrive, regional and international peace and security are crucial. That is the basic foundation of the success of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as it celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year. So, for the continued progress of South-East Asia and the region at large, it is the responsibility of all concerned to ensure a stable, safe and secure environment, one that is free of conflict, war or the threat of war. We also strive for stronger engagement through confidence-building, preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution through peaceful means. It is through such efforts and close cooperation among ourselves and with our external partners that ASEAN hopes to further contribute to global peace and development. ASEANâ??s achievements over the past 50 years in ensuring regional peace and security have enabled Brunei Darussalam to pursue its development objectives in a peaceful and harmonious environment. We are pleased that our country has consistently achieved very high ranking in the Human Development Index of the United Nations Development Programme. As the well-being of our people continues to be central to the nation, we are mindful of the negative impact of security threats, particularly with regard to our work to ensure a sustainable world. Like many others, we are concerned about the constant threats of terrorism and violent extremism. Sadly, in various parts of the world, the casualties resulting from terrorist attacks continue to shock us all. We condemn such horrendous acts and convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims. We wish to reiterate that terrorism should not be linked to any particular race, religion, nationality or ethnicity. In order to address those threats, it is important to comprehensively examine the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, marginalization and alienation, notably among youth. It is our hope that focusing on education and youth development, creating job opportunities, advocating the responsible use of social media and promoting dialogue among different faiths and civilizations will greatly help in our efforts to bring about positive change. It is equally important to instil in our peopleâ??s hearts and minds the values of peace, harmony, moderation and mutual respect. It is through those values that we may be able to create societies that are resilient to destructive ideologies. Working closely with youth, religious leaders and local communities will be essential to help to realize that. We therefore welcome all efforts of the international community to prevent and eradicate terrorism and violent extremism, in all their forms and manifestations. Also of great concern are pandemic diseases and natural disasters. On that note, I would like to join others in expressing our condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims of the recent natural disasters that have affected Mexico, Sierra Leone, the United States and countries in the Caribbean and South Asia. Given the destructive effects of natural disasters on any countryâ??s development and well-being, Brunei Darussalam values the work of all relevant agencies, including those of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and ASEAN. They provide us with means to gain expertise and knowledge on how to deal with the challenges posed by such threats. As we seek to ensure that no one is left behind, we should not forget the plight of those suffering from war, conflict and occupation. Like everyone else, Palestinians have hopes and dreams of being educators, doctors, engineers, artists, athletes and innovators, which are all for the good of humankind. However, for half a century, foreign occupation has prevented many of them from achieving their full human potential for making a greater contribution to global development. Peace, freedom, justice and self-determination are Palestiniansâ?? fundamental rights. As the legitimate and truly representative Organization of the globe, the United Nations has a moral and legal obligation to enforce those rights and ensure accountability for actions that contravene international law. We continue to count on the United Nations, as well as all relevant parties, to find comprehensive and lasting peace and stability in the region. We must press on with all efforts to translate the growing international recognition of the State of Palestine into positive changes on the ground, so that Palestinians can pursue sustainable development in their own homeland. Brunei Darussalam looks to the United Nations to address pressing issues around the world. It is important for the United Nations to enhance its working relationship with its network of partners, including regional organizations such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth and ASEAN. In order to better reflect the needs and realities of the twenty-first century, the world needs a stronger, more effective and more efficient United Nations. To that end, we support our Secretary-Generalâ??s ideas for reforming the United Nations and repositioning our Organization to focus more on measures for preventing conflicts, including mediation. We believe such endeavours will greatly help the United Nations optimize its work and resources and, above all, save lives, safeguard peopleâ??s dignity and promote peace and security around the world. We want a United Nations that is fit for its purposes and principles, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of all Member States to ensure that the United Nations truly lives up to its name. As we strive for a better future together, we hope for a successful United Nations. A successful United Nations benefits humankind. When humankind benefits, we all win.",1,196
7727,Session 72 - 2017,BTN_72_2017.txt,BTN_72_2017,72,2017,BTN,"I bring warm greetings from His Majesty the Druk Gyalpo. Today my thoughts are with the people of Mexico, who suffered two terrible earthquakes this month. My thoughts are also with the victims of the other natural disasters that have recently brought pain and misery to people around the world â?? the three hurricanes that battered communities in the Caribbean and the United States and the devastating floods in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka that have taken more than 1,200 lives. Please join me in observing a moment of silence to reflect on the suffering of those communities and to offer our prayers for their recovery. The disasters I just referred to are not isolated incidents. Experts are increasingly convinced that natural disasters like hurricanes and floods are made worse by climate change. Climate change is a reality. Each of the past three years has been the hottest in recorded history, and 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have all occurred in this new century. That must alarm us, for we are only in 2017. There is no room for complacency, hesitation or finger-pointing, excuses or procrastination. The urgency is now. Our well-being is at stake. The survival of future generations is at risk. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is proof that we have accepted that climate change is a reality, and that we are willing to come together, to work together and to fight climate change together. I urge all countries to fulfil the promises they made in Paris. As a landlocked, mountainous country, we are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. That is why we are particularly alarmed about unchecked environmental degradation, which is the root cause of climate change. We are already experiencing flash floods, glacial lake outbursts and severe and erratic weather patterns, whsoe effects can be particularly devastating for a poor country. But we will not give up. We will take action. We have ratified the Paris Agreement and are well on our way to fulfilling our pledges. A total of 72 per cent of our country is under forest cover, and more than half of it is protected as national parkland, wildlife sanctuaries or nature reserves. That means that we are the worldâ??s only carbon-neutral country. In fact, we are a carbon-negative country. In addition, we generate and export clean renewable energy and invest in green industries and organic farming practices. After centuries of neglect, fighting climate change is complex and expensive. That is why it is critical to ensure that all countries fulfil their respective commitments. But that takes money; hence the importance of climate financing mechanisms. However, securing financing is one of the biggest challenges that smaller nations have, and the role of climate-financing institutions is therefore essential. We applaud the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) for financing more than 4,000 environmental projects in 170 countries since its establishment in the 1990s. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has also begun to help developing countries around the world respond to climate change through innovative and transformative interventions. Those institutions are critical for those who have the will but may not have the resources to take action. I applaud the innovative strategies and interventions that they have supported. For our part, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund we have launched Bhutan for Life, an innovative financing mechanism that will help safeguard our rich biodiversity until our Government can assume the full cost of its protection. Now is the time to scale up our support to the GEF and GCF. That will enable all countries to fight climate change on a war footing and help developing countries respond to its effects. I am optimistic that we will be able to prevent the worst effects of climate change. But for that we have to work together. While the threat of natural disasters will always remain, we can and must ensure that they are not directly linked to human- induced activity. The World Bank estimates that more than 800 million people live in poverty. For them, hunger, malnourishment and deprivation are everyday realities. And that reality â?? the scourge of poverty â?? silently kills countless millions every year. I ask members to please join me in observing a moment of silence for the millions of people around the world, particularly children, who are suffering or dying from poverty and malnourishment. Poverty has no place in this day and age. After all, this era â?? our era â?? is blessed with unprecedented wealth, knowledge and technology, giving rise to levels of prosperity the world has never seen before. Yet millions are still condemned to a life of poverty. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are critical in that regard. They give us reason for hope. While every one of the 17 Goals will contribute to eradicating the scourge of poverty, our common resolve is articulated powerfully in the very first Goal of the SDGs, which promises nothing less than to end poverty everywhere and in all its forms. Eradicating poverty, like dealing with climate change, is complex and expensive. But according to one estimate, it would take only $175 billion per year to end extreme poverty. That should come as good news, since it is barely 0.32 per cent of the current global gross domestic product. We no doubt have a lot of work to do, but the SDGs provide a realistic road map for this important task. However, there are no easy shortcuts. In that connection, the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform initiatives will ensure that the United Nations is fit for purpose and able to respond to the call for transformation in order to bring about shared prosperity for all peoples of the world. I thank him for initiating such bold measures, and call on all Member States to give full support to the important reforms. We in Bhutan are blessed. Our enlightened monarchs have carefully balanced economic growth with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within a framework of good governance. We call this holistic approach to development Gross National Happiness, a unique philosophy that guarantees all of our citizens free education and free health care, while providing additional targeted interventions for the poor. I am happy to report that our efforts are bearing fruit. Multidimensional poverty has already fallen by half, and we are well on our way to reducing it still further, to 5 per cent within the next few years. Our success in reducing poverty is a tribute to the leadership of our kings and the spirit of the people of Bhutan. It is also due to the support of the United Nations and our other development partners, particularly India, Japan, the European Union, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Their continued support, partnership and generosity have helped us reduce poverty, achieve social growth and prepare for imminent graduation from the least-developed-country category. I now ask everyone to join me in observing a moment of silence to remember the victims of global terrorism. Recent acts of terrorism have brought pain and suffering to countless people in nearly every part of the world, and far too many lives have been cruelly lost. The horrific acts committed by terrorist groups undermine global peace and security, and Bhutan joins the call for united action to combat those extremists. To win the fight against terrorism, we have no option but to strengthen the United Nations so that multilateralism and global cooperation are further enhanced. Two years ago, I joined many others in calling for United Nations reform. The Secretary- Generalâ??s reform initiatives will provide a much- needed framework for revitalizing and strengthening the United Nations. Bhutan joins all Member States in backing that bold endeavour. But any United Nations reform would be incomplete without reforming the Security Council to reflect the changing realities of todayâ??s world. In that regard, countries like India, Japan, Brazil and Germany must be called on to serve as permanent members in the Security Council, and Africa must also be appropriately represented. We recognize that global peace and security are a shared concern and responsibility. As a peaceful country, one that has enjoyed the benefits of United Nations membership for more than four decades, we feel it is now time for us to contribute to global peace and security, if only modestly. Accordingly, it was with a sense of pride and duty in 2014 that Bhutan joined the peacekeeping movement. Since then, we have gradually increased our peacekeeping engagement in keeping with our duty to contribute, albeit in a small way, to the cause of global peace and security. In doing so our peacekeepers have and always will uphold the highest standards of integrity, ethics and professionalism while discharging their important responsibilities. Our military and police officers today serve in 11 peacekeeping missions, and the first-ever military contingent from Bhutan is now ready to be deployed to a peacekeeping mission. However, the bedrock of global peace and security ultimately lies within each and every one of our individual countries. Every country must therefore protect the rights of its citizens, strengthen participatory democracy and participatory Government and enable economic opportunity for all. Those are the very principles of democracy and freedom. They must be nurtured and strengthened. Nine years ago, Bhutan embarked on the path of democracy. In an unprecedented move in human history, our King, at the height of his popularity, imposed democracy, against the will of his people. After a century of peace and prosperity under enlightened monarchs, there was much apprehension and fear. But nine years on, it gives me great satisfaction to report that democracy in Bhutan is well entrenched and irreversible. Today all the institutions of democratic governance have been established and are functioning well, along with a growing body of civil society and a strong and vibrant media. We held successful elections in 2008 and 2013, and look forward to a third election next year, in 2018. The importance of the United Nations has never been greater, and the imperative for multilateralism has never been stronger. As we look to the future, Bhutan will continue working with all Member States to ensure that the United Nations continues to play an instrumental role in fighting climate change, eradicating poverty and maintaining global peace and security. In that regard, I have the honour to conclude with a quotation from our beloved King, His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck: â??No nation today can stand alone in achievement. Time is slowly telling us that there can be no lasting individual success without success as a community, and there cannot be lasting national progress and success if it does not fit into a future of global peace, harmony and equality. The world must progress together or fail together.â??",1,196
7728,Session 72 - 2017,BWA_72_2017.txt,BWA_72_2017,72,2017,BWA,"I feel deeply honoured and privileged to deliver this statement on behalf of the President of the Republic of Botswana, His Excellency Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama. On behalf of my delegation, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I assure you of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your mandate. In the same vein, please allow me to pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, for his stewardship of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. I would also take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to our new Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, and his Deputy and wish them an enjoyable and successful tenure at the helm of our world body. We also thank our former Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and the valuable contribution he made towards advancing the mandate of the Organization over the past decade. We are gathered here at the United Nations because we share a common destiny. Despite its imperfections, the United Nations remains the only universal organization that has the moral authority and legitimacy to seek global solutions to the challenges we face. Botswana is of the firm conviction that as Member States, we collectively hold the will and the power to change the world for the better and for the benefit of both present and future generations. Botswana welcomes the theme of this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. We strongly feel that that theme is pertinent because it reinforces the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the global community adopted on 25 September 2015 as a â??plan of action for people, planet and prosperityâ?? or a charter for â??people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnershipâ?? in the twenty-first century (resolution 70/1). That theme appropriately draws our attention to four of the five Ps of the 2030 Agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. It recognizes the importance of focusing on people and improving their lives, as they are both the main beneficiaries of development and its greatest resource, as we work to achieve peace and development on a sustainable and resilient basis. The theme thus recognizes the nexus between peace and security, sustainable development and climate change. In that regard, the 2030 Agenda notes that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. It is therefore imperative that we give priority to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in order to achieve sustainable development and address climate change. With regard to people, I am pleased to state that the Government of Botswana embarked on a series of multi-stakeholder consultations involving both the public and the private sectors, civil society, local authorities, development partners and academia in the formulation of our National Development Plan 11, which runs from 2017 to 2023, and in the formulation of our current Vision 2036, which runs from 2017 to 2036. The Plan and the Vision are both aligned to the 2030 Agenda and the African Union Agenda 2063. We purposefully undertook extensive consultations so as to ensure that our national priorities reflect our peopleâ??s needs and aspirations. We hold the view that our people have a right to sustainable development and improved quality of life. We must, therefore, pursue those twin objectives as a moral and political imperative. It is important to recall that when we adopted Agenda 2030 two years ago, we acknowledged that every goal, every target and every indicator in the Agenda represents a step towards a better world. We recognized the need for each country, based on its needs and circumstances, to formulate a unique set of actions to achieve the universal goals that we set for ourselves. We also recognized that innovation, science and technology will be critical catalysts in the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In line with the theme of the seventy-second session, our two national development frameworks place heavy emphasis on improving the quality of life of all people in Botswana through the acceleration of socioeconomic development and the provision of better education, health care and housing, and by tackling extreme poverty, income inequality, gender inequality and unemployment, especially among young people and women. Driven by our strong desire to build an inclusive, peaceful and prosperous society based on the respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, we accordingly adjusted our empowerment programmes in order to ensure that they cater to all vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society, including women and girls, young people, the elderly, people with disabilities, and children. To that end, the top priorities of our National Development Plan 11 are human-capital development, social development, the development of diversified sources of economic growth, the sustainable use of natural resources, the consolidation of good governance, the strengthening of national security and the implementation of an effective monitoring and evaluation system. In order to ensure that all our people live in dignity, the Government of Botswana took a bold policy decision to shift from poverty reduction to the eradication of extreme poverty, which resulted in a marked reduction in the proportion of the population living in abject poverty or below $1.25 per day, from 24.5 per cent in 2002-2003 to 6.4 per cent in 2009-2010. That is a notable achievement considering the fact that in 1985-1986, 59 per cent of the population was living in poverty. We identified the sustainable use of natural resources as one of the main priorities of our national development agenda so as to ensure that the natural wealth of our country benefits both present and future generations. To address youth unemployment, the Government introduced youth-empowerment programmes, such as the Youth Development Fund, the National Service Programme and the Internship Programme. For the past two decades, more than 25 per cent of the Governmentâ??s total annual budget has been invested in education and skills development. In addition, we have implemented a number of flagship programmes, the centrepiece of which is the Economic Stimulus Programme, which was introduced to stimulate the economy and address the infrastructure deficit. We are also proud that Botswana was among the countries that shared their 2030 Agenda implementation experience under the auspices of the recently held High-level Political Forum and Voluntary National Review exercises. On climate change, Botswana fully supports the observation made in the 2030 Agenda that â??[c]limate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable developmentâ?? (resolution 70/1, para. 140). In that regard, we welcome the entry into force of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and reaffirm our commitment to that agreement. Botswana is pleased to be among the countries that signed and ratified the Agreement before the threshold for ratifications for its entry into force was reached. We appeal to all countries to remain steadfast in their defence and protection of the integrity of the Paris Agreement. We reiterate our appeal to the Government of the United States of America to reconsider its decision to withdraw from that landmark agreement, which marks a universal effort by the international community to tackle the challenges of climate change. As those present are aware, the challenge of climate change requires collective action, as no single country can successfully address the challenge on its own. It is as if the recent hurricanes and their disastrous effects were meant to underscore to the American Administration that climate change is real. If there is anything positive that we have learned from those hurricanes, it is that it has been able to bring people in the affected states and wider America together â?? be they young or old, black, Hispanic or white or of whatever religious persuasion. We also welcome the recent convening by the President of the General Assembly of the first ever Ocean Conference in New York, pursuant to Sustainable Development Goal 14. Even though Botswana is a landlocked country, we are impacted in one way or the other by the ocean environment. We also have a strategic interest in benefiting from marine resources. It is for that reason that we actively participated in the negotiations that led to the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, to which we subsequently became a State party. I am delighted to announce that Botswana has responded positively to international humanitarian appeals, which have been made from time to time in response to humanitarian calamities that have afflicted a number of countries, including the extremely devastating famine in Somalia. Consistent with our caring and compassionate nature, we will continue to do everything we can, within the limit of our meagre resources, to extend assistance to fellow members of the human family who are in dire need of humanitarian relief. On international peace and security, the Charter of the United Nations states that the Organization was created â??to save succeeding generations from the scourge of warâ??, and yet peace continues to elude us, especially in some parts of Africa, as well as in other parts of the world. There are continuing reports of raging conflicts, gross human rights violations, extra- judicial killings, sexual violence and arbitrary arrests and detentions. The situation in South Sudan, in particular, continues to be a cause for grave concern. The country is virtually on a precipice. The people of that country have yet to enjoy the peace that the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan of August 2015 was widely expected to deliver. We therefore appeal to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development countries, as the main guarantors of the Agreement, to constructively engage the leaders and political stakeholders in South Sudan, with a view to getting them to unconditionally commit to the full and effective implementation of the Agreement. On Syria, the political, security and humanitarian situation there remains catastrophic. Botswana is on record as having consistently expressed disappointment at the Security Councilâ??s failure to take decisive action on the situation in Syria. That failure is due to the fact that some permanent members of the Council have, from time to time, vetoed resolutions that were aimed at addressing the political and humanitarian crisis in the country. In view of that unfortunate scenario, Botswana believes that the international community should always resort to using the moral power and authority of the General Assembly whenever there is paralysis in the Security Council. We also fully support the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, in order for those responsible for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity to be held accountable for their actions. Botswana is deeply concerned about the unrelenting and blatant contravention of international law and United Nations resolutions by North Korea through its continued testing of ballistic missiles. Those despicable acts by North Korea pose a threat, not only to the Korean peninsula, but throughout the Pacific region and the world at large. It is obvious to us, as it should be to everyone else, that North Korea is being assisted by others in its development of missiles and nuclear technology. They are, therefore, as much to blame for those missile and nuclear tests as North Korea itself is. We therefore appeal to the international community to work in unison and take prompt and decisive action that will force North Korea to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Inaction is not an option in the face of such adversity. Regime change must be brought about in order to remove, once and for all, the everlasting threat to peace in that region and give the North Korean people hope for a life of freedom and prosperity. On Western Sahara, it is reprehensible that that territory remains the only non-self-governing territory on the African continent. We therefore reiterate our support for and solidarity with the people of Western Sahara in the pursuit of their just and inalienable right to self-determination. We strongly feel that it is high time that they be allowed to exercise that right through an independent and impartial vote under the supervision of the United Nations. The Sahrawi have waited long enough for that to happen. We similarly support the people of Palestine in their legitimate struggle for sovereignty and independent statehood. As a gesture of our support and solidarity, I am pleased to report that Botswana established diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine on 8 March. Botswana strongly condemns terrorism, violent extremism and racial intolerance in all their forms and manifestations. In that regard, it is deeply regrettable that we have recently witnessed a spate of terrorist attacks on innocent people and Governments around the world. I wish to state that we stand firmly in solidarity with the Governments and the peoples of the countries concerned and extend our deepest sympathy to them. We need to be constantly mindful of the fact that no single country is immune to terrorist attacks. Those attacks are a stark reminder of the ferocious nature of terrorism. The international community must, therefore, urgently take concerted action to resolutely fight that scourge. Botswana fully supports the international communityâ??s efforts towards nuclear disarmament. We also reaffirm our commitment to international instruments that ban weapons of mass destruction, such as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and the Biological Weapons Convention. In that regard, we welcome the recent adoption by the General Assembly of a legally binding treaty to prohibit the production of nuclear weapons. We are fully convinced that only a nuclear-free world will guarantee a safer future for our populations. Botswana greatly values the opportunity it was given to contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights through its membership in the Human Rights Council for two consecutive terms. With the imminent end of our tenure in the Council in December, I wish to reaffirm that we will continue to work earnestly with the international community to advance the global human rights agenda and so that all the people of the world can live in democracies where human rights and the rule of law are upheld. Our advocacy on human rights is premised on the firm belief that societyâ??s aspirations for sustainable development will remain a mirage unless we redouble our collective efforts towards equality and human dignity. In conclusion, I would like to urge everyone to maintain the momentum on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Let us summon our collective wisdom and strength, coupled with our singularity of purpose, to deliver real change for the benefit of the peoples we represent.

7729,Session 72 - 2017,CAF_72_2017.txt,CAF_72_2017,72,2017,CAF,"I should like to add my voice to those that have preceded me at this rostrum in order to extend to you, Mr. President, my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. We wish you every success in fulfilling your noble task. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his tremendous work and outstanding achievements during his tenure. And I commend Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for his actions since his arrival at the head of our shared Organization. The General Assembly is meeting for its seventy- second session at a time when our planet is facing numerous challenges, including the problem of international terrorism, that must be urgently addressed. Insecurity has taken root everywhere. Whether in the Middle East, Africa or Europe, international security is constantly under threat from terrorist groups of every stripe. That is why I am appealing solemnly to the entire international community to redouble its efforts and pool its resources in order to eradicate this scourge. Regarding migration, North Africa is in turmoil as it sees so many victims abandoned in the desert or disappearing at sea. The route across the Mediterranean frequently ends in disaster and continues to be a major challenge that we must tackle. Moreover, the problem of refugees has worsened in recent years and is now so serious that it is a priority concern of the international community that demands special attention. Concerning climate change and sustainable development, our planet continues to suffer the effects of natural phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, drought, rapid desertification and global warming, which are real worries. To that end, I would remind us all, as signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, that we should honour the commitments made at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change regarding the importance of pooling our efforts in order to preserve our shared environment. With regard to United Nations reform, the Central African Republic, as a member of the African Union (AU), supports the common position of AU member States, as adopted by the Group of Eleven Forum in Malabo, on the need to enlarge the Security Council to include Africa. Other global issues are the respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, which are indispensable prerequisites for social welfare. I pledge that the Central African Republic will continue to make its modest contribution to our joint efforts for peace, security and sustainable development, to which we all aspire. I welcome the choice of theme for the present session, entitled â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, an appropriate reflection of the importance of humankindâ??s place in our Organizationâ??s agenda and in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted here in 2015 with the aim of reducing poverty by half by 2030. Today, as part of its national reconstruction policy, the Central African Republicâ??s peacebuilding and recovery programme puts its citizens, as human beings, at the heart of its priorities. With the support of our technical and financial partners, the programme has enabled the Government to establish an appropriate institutional framework for the conduct, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs, with particular emphasis on the objectives that have been identified as priorities. Since this meeting of the Assembly offers me an opportunity to speak about the situation of the Central African Republic, let me say a few words about that. At the Brussels donor conference in November 2016, I mentioned the dream I share with my fellow countrymen of rebuilding a State that can come to terms with itself as a diverse and reconciled nation in a state of calm. Our plea led, as I have indicated, to an unprecedented display of international solidarity with the Central African Republic aimed at ensuring the implementation of the Central African peacebuilding and recovery programme. In order to follow up on the planâ??s implementation, we have reached an agreement that will serve as a new framework for mutual commitment between the Central African Republic and the international community. It is in that spirit of continuing consultation with partners that on Tuesday, 19 September, here in New York, I presented an account of the progress we have made in implementing our commitments to attaining the Central African peacebuilding and recovery programme. To touch on some aspects of the programme, with regard to our commitment to peace and security, the Government of the Central African Republic has combined its resources in order to consolidate the process for the cessation of all hostilities in the country. Through hard work, we have been able to secure the active and permanent participation of the 14 armed groups involved in the work of our consultative follow-up committee on disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation (DDRR) in the national DDRR programme, and the committee held its seventh session on 3 and 4 August. In our determined quest for peace, we accepted the assistance of the Community of Santâ??Egidio, which led to the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace in the Central African Republic on 19 June. On that occasion all the armed groups had to reaffirm their commitment to the integrity of our national territory, to our shared values and to the constitutional principles of the Republic. Despite that significant progress, we deplore certain armed groupsâ?? violations of their commitment to an immediate cessation of hostilities throughout the country, and my Government categorically condemns the senseless violence that continues to darken the lives of innocent civilians. In order to galvanize the peace process into reaching its full potential, strengthen the coherence of our approach and unite the support of our friends, we have worked to harmonize all the peace efforts in the Central African Republic, resulting in the adoption of a road map for peace and national reconciliation in the Central African Republic in Libreville on 17 July. We welcome that major progress, which marks the unwavering commitment of our neighbours and of the African Union, the Economic Community of Central African States and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to the success of our untiring quest for peace. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the very promising outcome of the first meeting of the facilitation panel of the African Initiative in Bangui on 11 September. Here, before the Assembly, I reaffirm my commitment to the African Initiative, as well as to ensuring its full success for the benefit of my fellow citizens, in line with the expectations we share with the friendly countries and organizations that are supporting us. At this stage, it is the sole framework uniting all efforts aimed at achieving peace and reconciliation under the determined leadership of the Central African Government. Within the context of the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programme, the work of the advisory and monitoring committee continues, and the programme has gained steam with the pilot project that I launched on 30 August. Its first phase involves 40 ex-combatants from each of 13 of the 14 armed groups. We are making every effort to ensure that the pilot programmeâ??s success becomes a monument to our true commitment to peace, because our faith in peace is unshakable. At the same time, we are working to rebuild a national, representative, professional and republican army within a framework of security-sector reform, informed by a national security policy based on a political consensus that takes threats to security into account, and on the republican values and principles that must guide the State in its sovereign mission to ensure security for all. In that spirit, the support offered by the European Union Military Training Mission in the Central African Republic has enabled us to form two battalions ready for deployment, and friendly and brotherly countries have made a concrete demonstration of their solidarity by training Central African components in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. In order to address the need to strengthen internal security, 500 police and gendarmes have been recruited with the help of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). In the areas of justice and human rights, our efforts have focused on operationalizing the Special Criminal Court and training prison guards, as well as on improving our judicial and penitentiary infrastructure. My Government attaches great importance to national reconciliation, but that cannot be achieved without justice, which must address the many claims of victims. The Administrationâ??s redeployment in the prefectures is also one of our biggest and most urgent priorities, and its implementation has had support from the international community. I welcome the redeployment of civil servants in the various districts of the country, as well as the considerable resources that have already been invested in restoring public infrastructure. With the continued support of our friends and through the United Nations, the Government has initiated the Bambari pilot project, aimed at signalling the restoration of State authority. With that new momentum in redeploying the Administration throughout the territory, we are proceeding in stages so as to ensure that the approach is as inclusive as possible. Regarding financial governance, the Governmentâ??s work is yielding encouraging results, which must be pursued more vigorously, given that the country has yet to emerge fully from the acute crisis that tore it apart. Since the agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund in June 2016, several measures have been implemented to increase the Stateâ??s financial performance. The strengthening of public financial management mechanisms has been reflected in the adoption of measures to rationalize parafiscal measures and increase transparency so as better to cope with revenue shortfalls. The outcome of the second review under the extended credit-facility management issued by the International Monetary Fund in July confirms that we have definitely embarked on a path of good financial governance. Economic recovery is another area that we are giving undivided attention. The protracted crisis had a disastrous impact on production and has led to high poverty rates. The lack of economic opportunities and prospects have led some of my fellow citizens to join those resorting to violence. The reconstruction of the Central African Republic will continue to elude us as long as production continues to be unpredictable, unregimented and completely unregulated by the authorities. Among other measures, my Government is meanwhile committed to building up its DDRR programme so that all the energy that was previously channelled into negative activity can be reinvested more profitably in the service of the nation and for community recovery. In that regard, the primary sector, agriculture and livestock are central to our efforts. The exploitation of natural resources, a sector in urgent need of attention, must be entirely controlled by the State. While we all know that the Central African Republic is overflowing with immense resources, they will continue to be empty words if we cannot harness those resources for a positive impact on the daily life of every one of my fellow citizens. Despite all these efforts and the progress that has been made, we must not ignore the humanitarian situation, which has seriously deteriorated in several parts of the country in the wake of a resurgence of violence, whose real motive continues is still a rapacious and fierce competition for the illegal control and exploitation of the riches that lie beneath and on the surface of the soil of the Central African Republic. Some 2.4 million people are estimated to be in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. We are dealing with 600,000 internally displaced persons who must be supported and helped so that they can return to their homes and lead productive lives. On top of that, we estimate that 500,000 of our citizens are currently refugees living primarily in neighbouring countries, and we must make every effort to repatriate them. The humanitarian crisis we are experiencing only compounds the complexity of the political situation, and we must work to remedy it. With regard to future action, I would like to share with the Assembly our main areas of focus within the mutual engagement framework. On the issue of peace and security, I want to concentrate all our efforts on ensuring that we will have taken significant steps in terms of dialogue with armed groups and the implementation of the national DDRR programme by the end of this year, and I am firmly committed to that. Nevertheless, although the dialogue in this area is under way, it is a fact that the State must continue to function and especially to ensure the safety of all citizens. In order for the Forces armÃ©es centrafricaines and the interior security forces to undertake their redeployment efforts, they must be able to take action. On behalf of the people of the Central African Republic, I therefore solemnly call on the Security Council, as the political organ of the United Nations tasked with ensuring world peace, to deploy the means at its disposal, including relaxing the conditions governing the equipping of our republican defence and security forces so that they can contribute to the rapid restoration of peace and security in the Central African Republic and enable us to consolidate the democratic achievements made thus far. With respect to political, administrative and financial governance, we are going to strengthen our dialogue with all national actors and provide political support for the implementation of the road map for peace and reconciliation in our country. Our most ardent wish is to be able to conclude that dialogue in 2017, so that the new year will have genuine prospects for peace. In that regard I call on the African Union, the Economic Community of Central African States and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to act swiftly and accelerate the deliberations of the facilitation panel. I will also commit to working in the area of justice and reconciliation. The preparations for the implementation of the transitional justice mechanism should enable us to make 2018 a year dedicated to the immense task of giving our citizens the opportunity to talk to one another in a candid way, help the truth emerge and decide to move forward towards a brighter future. In brief, that is our situation. That is the work that we are doing constantly to achieve peace, reconciliation and the reconstruction of the Central African Republic. I am fully committed to the success of efforts to bring about peace. However, Member States are undoubtedly aware of the Central African Republicâ??s limited capacity. Today, on top of our own weaknesses, we are worried about the fact that even MINUSCAâ??s staff is inadequate to the challenge of protecting our civilians. The heightened security threats linked to violence from armed groups mean that more must be done to ensure that the crisis does not spread. As I plead for the easement of the equipment restrictions on our army, I now also call on the international community to increase MINUSCAâ??s military component, given the huge territory that it has to cover. I also ask that its mandate, which will expire very soon, be reviewed and strengthened, so as to help the legitimate Government regain control of those areas that have natural resources sought after by various groups beyond Government control. I would like to express the gratitude of the Central African people to the brotherly countries that have sent peacekeepers to my country. I pay tribute to the memory of those who have perished in carrying out their noble and dangerous mission of peace. I wish every success for our deliberations and am grateful for the opportunity to speak about my country, the Central African Republic.",1,196
7730,Session 72 - 2017,CAN_72_2017.txt,CAN_72_2017,72,2017,CAN,"Before I begin, in the light of Tuesdayâ??s earthquake in Mexico, I would like to offer Canadaâ??s condolences to all families and friends in mourning. We wish a speedy recovery for all those who were injured and thank all first responders for their tireless efforts to help keep people safe. Our thoughts are also with our friends in the Caribbean, who continue to suffer from devastating hurricanes. The generosity and resilience that millions have shown in the face of those natural disasters is an inspiration to the world. Canada stands ready to lend a helping hand whenever we can. It is an honour to be back here at the General Assembly today and to have an opportunity to speak to this yearâ??s theme, namely, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. People. Peace. A good quality of life and an environment that we take care of. Equality for all, no matter where. That is what counts in the eyes of Canadians. Throughout our history, we have worked tirelessly to realize our ambitions both at home and elsewhere in the world. Today I would like to speak about the difficult lessons that Canada has learned along the way. Canada is not a wonderland where the difficulties experienced by others do not exist. We face the same challenges. Canada is continually evolving. Canada remains a work in progress. I want to tell the Assembly about the Canadian experience because, for all the mistakes we have made, we remain hopeful â?? hopeful that we can do better, and be better, and treat each other with the dignity and the respect that is the birthright of every human being. I want to tell the Assembly our story because I know that the challenges we have faced, and continue to face, are not unique in the world, nor are the solutions. An approach that values human dignity and emphasizes fairness and real opportunity for everyone has a home in Canada and in every country. It is an approach that does not just serve domestic needs but makes the world a better, more peaceful, more prosperous place for all. This year Canada celebrates the 150th anniversary of out Confederation. But Canada is much older than that. It has been home to the descendants of settlers and immigrants for hundreds of years, and indigenous peoples for millenniums. We are a country that is built on different cultures, different religions and different languages all coming together. Such diversity has become our great strength. But that is not, and has not always been, true for everyone who shares our land. Canada is built on the ancestral land of indigenous peoples, but, regrettably, it is also a country that came into being without the meaningful participation of those who were there first. Even treaties that were developed to provide a foundation for proper relations have not been fully honoured or implemented. For First Nations, MÃ©tis Nation and Inuit peoples in Canada, those early colonial relationships were not about strength through diversity or a celebration of our differences. For indigenous peoples in Canada, their experience was mostly one of humiliation, neglect and abuse. They were victims of a Government that did not respect them; their traditions, their assets, their way of governing or their laws. It chose to deny and undermine their rights and their dignity. They were victims of a Government that sought to rewrite their unique history and eradicate their languages and cultures by imposing colonial traditions and their own way of life. They were victims of a Government that refused to protect their lands and waters and that rejected their principle of always thinking seven generations ahead. In short, we rejected the very idea of entire generations of indigenous peoples defining their own lives with the dignity and pride they are due. We have deprived Canada of the significant contributions that those generations could have made to the progression of our great country. The inability of successive Canadian Governments to respect the rights of indigenous peoples in Canada causes us great shame. For too many indigenous peoples, that lack of respect for their rights persists today. Today there are still children living on reserves in Canada who cannot safely drink, bathe in or even play in the water that comes out of their taps. There are indigenous parents who say goodnight to their children and have to cross their fingers in the hope that their kids will not run away or take their own lives in the night. Young indigenous people in Canada struggle to get a good education. Although residential schools are thankfully a thing of the past, too many indigenous youth are still sent away, far from their families, just to get the basic education most Canadians take for granted. For far too many indigenous women, life in Canada includes threats of violence so frequent and severe that Amnesty International has called it a human rights crisis. That is the legacy of colonialism in Canada, of a paternalistic Indian Act, of the forced relocation of Inuit and First Nations communities and a systematic denial of MÃ©tis rights and history, of residential schools that separated children as young as 5 years old from their families, punished them for speaking their own language and sought to extinguish indigenous cultures entirely. The good news is that Canadians get it. They see the inequities, and they are fed up with the excuses. And that impatience gives us a rare and precious opportunity to act. We now have before us an opportunity to deliver true, meaningful and lasting reconciliation between Canada and First Nations, the MÃ©tis Nation, and Inuit peoples. At a time where we seek to reconcile, we should be guided by the basic standards adopted in this Hall 10 years ago this month. I know that in the past Canadaâ??s position on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was disappointing. We actively campaigned and voted against such rights, only to finally accept them reluctantly by saying that it was simply a document of aspirations. However, they are not aspirations. The Declaration is very concrete for indigenous peoples and for those who who worked long and hard to make that document a reality. In the words of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, the Declaration provides the necessary principles, norms and standards for reconciliation to flourish in twenty-first-century Canada. That is not an aspiration, that is a way forward. Last year, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Canadaâ??s then Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs finally corrected Canadaâ??s position on the Declaration, and announced that we are now, without qualification, a full supporter of the Declaration. In partnership with indigenous peoples, we are moving ahead with a thorough review of federal laws, policies and operational practices to get our house in order and make sure that our Government is meeting its obligations, including international obligations under the Declaration. We know that the world expects Canada to strictly adhere to international human rights standards â?? including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples â?? and that is what we expect of ourselves too. We are working closely with indigenous peoples in Canada to better respond to their priorities, to better understand how they see and define self-determination and to support their work of nation rebuilding. Along with indigenous partners, we are co-developing programmes to ensure the preservation, protection and revitalization of MÃ©tis, Inuit and First Nations languages. In short, we have been working hard, in partnership with other orders of Government and with indigenous leaders in Canada, to correct past injustices and to bring about a better quality of life for indigenous peoples in Canada. I will give a few examples. Many will sound familiar because they are closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) â?? goals that apply to all of our countries without exception. Our efforts include investments to help bring safe and clean drinking water to all indigenous communities, part of Sustainable Development Goal 6, on clean water and sanitation. So far, more than two dozen long-term drinking-water advisories in indigenous communities have been eliminated, and we have a plan to bring to an end those that remain. Those efforts take the form of new investments to eliminate gaps in the education of First Nations. The new agreements recognize the power and authority of First Nations. They also consider ways to create and manage educational systems that are managed within the communities, by the communities and for the communities. Those important notions are in line with Sustainable Development Goal 4, on quality education. For many indigenous peoples in Canada, among other things, those investments will enable laying the foundation for reaching Sustainable Development Goal 8, on decent work and economic growth. We know that no one can hope to have a true and equal chance of succeeding without good health, a solid community, a well-paid quality job, quality education and safe and affordable housing. Of course, that also applies to indigenous peoples. That is why our efforts include working with indigenous communities to help build and refurbish homes. Construction work on nearly 4,000 homes has been completed or is under way, helping to fulfil SDG 11, on making communities safe and sustainable places to live. And across the country, we are also working on a national housing strategy to give more Canadians access to housing that is safe, affordable and adequate. Our efforts also include a sharper focus on indigenous communities across Canada and around the world as it relates to SDG 5, on combating gender- based violence and giving women and girls equal opportunities to succeed. We need women and girls to succeed because that is how we grow stronger economies and build stronger communities. That is why our Government will be moving forward shortly with legislation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value. The Sustainable Development Goals are as meaningful in Canada as they are everywhere else in the world. We are committed to implementing them at home, while we also work with our international partners to achieve them around the world. That is important, because poverty and hunger know no borders. We cannot pretend that those solvable challenges happen only on distant shores. The need for greater equality and decent work are real and persistent human needs â?? ones we cannot afford to ignore, especially in our own countries. It is up to each of us to ensure that all of us, including indigenous peoples, have better opportunities. It is our responsibility to ensure that true equality is unconditional. Equality applies to us all, regardless of our gender, origin, beliefs or the person we choose to love. It is our responsibility to take better care of the environment that we all share. As I said here at the signing ceremony of the Paris Agreement, we are all implicated, in all senses of the word. We are all responsible, and our new ways of doing things must take that into account. In Canada that means new relationships between the Government of Canada and indigenous peoples â?? relationships based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. We recently made changes to our Government structures to help with the transition to those new relationships with indigenous peoples. We are dismantling the old colonial bureaucratic structures and creating a new Department of Crown- Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, led by Carolyn Bennett, an experienced and effective advocate for indigenous peoples in Canada. In her new role, she will lead our Governmentâ??s efforts to better support indigenous peoples as they strengthen their distinct political, cultural, legal and economic institutions and assume autonomy over their own affairs, including the recognition and implementation of self-government as an expression of self-determination. At the same time, we recognize that in Canada the federal Government has a historic responsibility for providing services to indigenous peoples and an ongoing role to play. To better do that work while at the same time supporting indigenous self-determination, in consultation with indigenous peoples, we will create a new Department of Indigenous Services, led by our former Minister of Health, Jane Philpott. Over time, programmes and services will increasingly be delivered by indigenous peoples, as part of their move towards true self-government and the full implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We believe that this separation is the best way for Canada to meet its sustainable development commitments, while following the principle of self-determination, which is at the heart of the Declaration. We are in uncharted territory. No one has paved the way for us, but we cannot wait. The time has come to take our own journey together. The time has come to think outside the box, to move away from the limits imposed by old outdated colonial structures and to make room for innovation and structures that respect the inherent rights of indigenous peoples to govern themselves and to determine their own future. For the federal Government, that means making changes to how we operate. The departmental change I mentioned is part of fulfilling that responsibility. For indigenous peoples, it means taking a hard look at how they define and govern themselves as nations and Governments, and how they seek to relate to other orders of Government. Indigenous peoples will decide how they wish to represent and organize themselves. Some may choose to engage with our Government based on historic nations and treaties, others will use different shared experiences as the basis for coming together. The choice is theirs. That is precisely what self-determination demands. Although that path is uncharted, I am confident that we will reach a place of reconciliation, that we will reach a place as a country where nation-to- nation, Government-to-Government and Inuit-Crown relationships can be transformed â?? a place where the standards enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are fully realized not merely by Government mandate, but in true partnership with indigenous peoples. Part of that new partnership will involve addressing the shared challenge of climate change. Indigenous and northern communities are particularly affected by its stark reality. In communities across the north â?? places like Paulatuk, Kugluktuk, and Tuktoyaktuk â?? community members are finding sea ice conditions more dangerous and unpredictable for travelling and hunting in the winter. In Canadaâ??s western Arctic, the permafrost is melting and huge pieces of tundra are eroding into the ocean. Around Baffin Island, Inuit elders are finding it difficult to forecast the weather like they used to, so difficult that many are now reluctant to even try. At home, we are working hard to help those communities adapt and prepare for the future. At the international level, our commitment is unwavering. There is no country on the planet that can walk away from the challenge and reality of climate change. For our part, Canada will continue to fight for the global plan that has a realistic chance of countering it. We have a responsibility to future generations, and we will uphold it. We have a chance to build in Canada and around the world economies that are clean, that are growing, that are forward-looking. We will not let that opportunity pass us by. In Canada that means imposing a tariff on carbon-related pollution. When that is done properly, it is the most effective way of reducing emissions while continuing to grow the economy. It also means continuing to work with other countries to bring us closer to the goals we have set for ourselves. Last week in Montreal, we welcomed environment leaders from over 30 countries to participate in a working meeting. It was an opportunity for us to discuss the various ways of implementing the Paris Agreement and to maintain the international momentum towards a more sustainable future for all. Likewise, the global community has a responsibility to do all that it can to reduce inequality within and among countries. In Canada we are working hard to achieve that goal. We improved child benefit payments. Our new programme gives nine out of 10 families more money to help with the high cost of raising their kids, and because of that we expect to reduce child poverty in Canada by 40 per cent. We raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 per cent so that we could lower them for the middle class, and we are continuing to look for ways to make our tax system more fair. Right now we have a system that encourages wealthy Canadians to use private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. That is not fair, and we are going to fix it. We are investing to make education more affordable and accessible so that every Canadian can get the training needed to find and keep a good, well-paying job. That is particularly important at a time when automation is challenging the traditional definition of work. At the international level, we have reaffirmed Canadaâ??s commitment to reducing poverty and injustice, while also putting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at the heart of our development efforts. We have adopted that approach because we know that supporting women and girls leads to economic growth, and that peace and cooperation can then take root. Families and communities can then hope for a better quality of life. We are also working hard to deliver progressive trade agreements such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, which comes into effect today. CETA will expand opportunities for businesses, create good, well-paying jobs for workers and deliver meaningful economic growth â?? the kind of growth that benefits all our citizens, not just the wealthiest. We have the opportunity â?? and I would argue that we have the responsibility â?? to ensure that trade agreements include strong provisions to safeguard workersâ?? rights, to protect the environment and to ensure that the benefits of trade are felt more broadly. When we do that, we do not just grow our economies, we live up to our values. We say to ourselves and to one another that good enough just is not good enough, and that better is always possible. It is always possible to do better when people are at the heart of the decisions we make. People, as the theme of this general debate reminds us, are the key to building a peaceful and prosperous future. It is a future that we all want for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren. It is a future in which indigenous people in Canada and around the world have the right to participate as equal partners. It is a future that we can build if we work together. Our efforts to build a better relationship with indigenous peoples in Canada are not only about righting historical wrongs. They are about listening, learning and working together. They are also about concrete actions for the future. The reconciliation that we seek holds lessons for us all. We cannot build strong relationships if we refuse to have conversations. We cannot chart a more peaceful path if the starting point is suspicion and mistrust. And we cannot build a better world unless we work together, respect our differences, protect the vulnerable and stand up for the things that matter most. As I said last year, I know that it will be hard work. But I remain confident â?? for Canadaâ??s experience shows it to be true â?? that any challenge can be met if we meet it together.",1,196
7731,Session 72 - 2017,CHE_72_2017.txt,CHE_72_2017,72,2017,CHE,"I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Government and the citizens of Dominica and the Caribbean region, who are suffering from the destruction caused by the hurricanes. Switzerland will support the region. Since the year 2000, humankind has made remarkable progress in the fight against these major scourges: hunger, extreme poverty and difficulties in accessing education. But famine still affects 800 million people in the world, and every 10 seconds a child dies from malnutrition. Other challenges include climate change, global inequality, conflict and humanitarian disasters, as well as forced displacement and migration. No country, no actor on the world stage is in a position to find, alone, the answers to the challenges of today. They are too large. They are too complex. They transcend borders, and they concern the entire international community. We therefore need a forum where we can meet. We need a forum where we can develop solutions and monitor their implementation. We need an actor with the necessary legitimacy to contribute to the implementation of these solutions on the ground. I would like to recall Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Collective, not individual. Because I am a patriot and because I defend, as the President of Switzerland, the interests of my country, we need a strong multilateral system. We need a strong United Nations. In other words, we need the United Nations, and we need a strong United Nations. The fact that we must be reminded of that is a sign that should put us on alert. In order to preserve and strengthen the capacity of the United Nations, we must invest ceaselessly. Switzerland is actively involved in that regard. Investment in substantive issues is a top priority. It is important that we place at the heart of the activities of the United Nations the issues that will be of fundamental importance, tomorrow as today. In that regard, the States Members of the United Nations have made important strides in recent years. I am thinking, of course, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and of the desire to transfer resources from post-conflict management to prevention, in order to intensify peacebuilding activities. In those areas, it is necessary to make progress towards the objectives set. In that respect, the 2030 Agenda offers a good example. Its success will be measured by the yardstick of its implementation. Important steps have also been taken within the United Nations. Switzerland welcomes in particular the reforms of the United Nations system that Secretary- General Guterres is working to achieve in the three areas of peace and security, development and management. With regard to peace and security, Switzerland supports the priority that the Secretary-General gives to prevention for a very simple reason. When a conflict arises, the price to pay â?? humanitarian, economic and financial â?? is much higher than the cost of prevention activities. In order to strengthen conflict prevention, it is essential to promote human rights. Switzerland calls on all States to support the appeal of 13 June, which calls for human rights to be at the core of conflict prevention. Increasing mediation capabilities is another important means of preventing conflicts. In addition, the Global High-level Panel on Water and Peace, launched at the initiative of Switzerland, proposed yesterday, here in New York, measures to better prevent water- related conflicts. The United Nations and regional organizations can play a major role in that regard. Switzerland is actively committed to the non-proliferation and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences. It is convinced that only negotiations and a diplomatic process will lead to a solution to the security situation posed by the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. Trust is another important aspect. If an actor is to be able to take effective preventive measures, that actor needs to be trusted. For the United Nations, this means that the quality of the partnership established with the host State concerned and its population is of paramount importance. Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse break this relationship of trust. That is why Switzerland supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s action against all forms of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation committed by United Nations staff in the field. As part of its commitment to that issue, Switzerland will contribute to the Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. With regard to the United Nations development system, we welcome the proposal to further encourage joint initiatives by the various entities of the Organization. Allow me to mention two examples of areas where we face major challenges: migration and digital technology. By the end of 2016, the number of displaced persons across the world had reached a level not seen since the Second World War. The majority of them have been displaced in their own country. In Europe, for example, we must succeed in finding a solution based on solidarity between countries, and we must stabilize the political situation in Libya. Switzerland is working to ensure that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration addresses not only the challenges caused by international migration, but also its opportunities. The road ahead remains long. It is necessary that all States participate in that work. We are pleased to be able to contribute concretely to its success thanks to the involvement our Permanent Representative in New Yorkâ??s as a co-facilitator of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Another topical challenge is the advent of digital technology, which is dramatically transforming the world. It represents a great opportunity, but also a cross-border challenge. Topics such as access to the Internet for all and the impact of digitization on sustainable development, as well as cybersecurity, should be addressed together. The twelfth Internet Governance Forum, which Switzerland will host in Geneva in December, will provide an opportunity to discuss those issues. So as to maintain the capacity of the United Nations, we must also invest in the relevant processes â?? because the United Nations stands out as much by its areas of work as by its methods of work. Effective and modern management is needed to ensure the robustness of the United Nations system. Reforms in management are therefore essential. In our interconnected world, dialogue is essential. Dialogue requires the time and involvement of all parties. It has to be conducted on a broad basis and involve all the relevant actors. For example, it appears that political dialogue among States is insufficient with regard to combating climate change. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, clearly show that the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be implemented quickly. Scientists believe that if nothing is done, such phenomena will become a new reality with which we will have to deal. The private sector, whose role in innovation, progress and development is essential, is involved, for example, in developing solutions, in consultation with the scientific community and the political sphere. Scientific diplomacy and exchanges with scientists allow us to make the right decisions. As policymakers, we must base our decisions on established facts. Switzerland is firmly convinced of the importance of investing in a well-functioning multilateral system, particularly in an efficient United Nations. Confronted by current challenges, and in the interconnected world that is ours, the notion of â??every man for himselfâ?? is not a feasible option.",1,196
7732,Session 72 - 2017,CHL_72_2017.txt,CHL_72_2017,72,2017,CHL,"I want to begin by sending a fraternal greeting to the people of Mexico, and especially to the relatives and friends of the victims of the terrible earthquake that struck that fraternal country yesterday. I also convey my sentiments to the victims and all those affected by the hurricanes that in recent weeks and days have caused enormous damage in the region and, in some cases, irreparable losses. Those most recent catastrophes, caused by hurricanes more frequent and violent than usual â?? largely due to the warming of the oceans â?? remind us that we are at a key moment in the history of humankind, a defining moment that will have repercussions on our lives and on the lives of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. While the challenges we face today are different from those that gave rise to the Organization 72 years ago, they are as relevant and as defining as those faced by the postwar generation. On the one hand, the notion of development that has prevailed until now has been shaken by the relentless reality of climate change. We can close our eyes and deny a reality whose devastating effects will become more frequent and intense, or we can assume our responsibility. Beyond reducing carbon dioxide emissions, that implies daring to transform our production models and rethinking the type of growth we wish to promote. On the other hand, at a time when there is democracy in so many countries as never before, we see a citizenry that has grown impatient with institutions whose legitimacy has been called into question by corruption, inequality and inefficiency with regard to citizensâ?? most urgent demands. Finally, in an international scenario marked by uncertainty, another definition is required. We either let each State attempt to impose itself and take the greatest advantage of its position, or we work actively for common peace and stability by strengthening the multilateral instruments and cooperation. The fact that we are here today in this Hall, where so many have touted the strength of peaceful and collective work, requires us to look at the risks we face and take on individual and collective tasks, weighing the consequences of inaction. Today I bring the voice of Chile â?? a country that has learned from its history, a country that has known pain, but also hope. Beyond its geographical location in the extreme south of the American continent, my country is in fact not far from the world. Quite the contrary, it is fully within it. We therefore know that many of the great local challenges are, and will continue to be, global challenges, and that each global challenge must also find a local response. There is no room for fatalism in the face of those challenges. Today I bring the message of realistic optimism. It is possible to reverse past decisions, overcome inertia and correct our path. That is true for small and large countries, be they in the centre or on the periphery. The enormous strength of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is precisely that they not only propose a new approach to improving the living conditions of people, they propose that we do it together, based on the strengths of each country. Our commitment to national tasks is bolstered by contact with others. Faced with the choice of whether or not to join the fight against climate change, we have not doubted â?? simply because there is no room for denialism or selfish postures. In line with SDG 14, on the oceans, and the Paris Agreement, my country has launched a national action plan for climate change. Among the measures already under way are the green tax on carbon dioxide emissions from fixed sources and the transformation we have made in the energy sector. Since the start of this Administration, non-conventional renewable energy has gone from 6.3 per cent to 17 per cent of our matrix, and our goal is to reach 90 per cent by 2050. That is possible, because we have already started the energy transition. In addition, we have been active in the Our Oceans initiative. We have created new marine parks and marine-protected areas. Almost half of our exclusive economic zone is protected today, reaching the historic figure of 1,329,000 square kilometres under marine conservation. While we have made significant progress in that direction, we are aware that we must address another threat to marine ecosystems â?? plastics. Year after year, 8 million tons of plastic make their way to the ocean, remaining there for hundreds of years and making a huge negative impact. To tackle that problem, we participate in the Clean Seas campaign of the United Nations Environment Programme. Meanwhile, at the local level, we will present a draft bill to ban the use of plastic bags in coastal cities within 12 months. That law will permit citizens to contribute to the protection of the oceans. We will thus be the first country in America to implement that type of law, and we call on other countries to assume that responsibility. Additionally, it is now 30 years since the adoption of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which enabled the ozone layer to recover. On this thirtieth anniversary, I would like to announce that my country has just deposited its ratification of the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to prevent 0.5Â°C of global warming. Chile thereby becomes one of the first countries to ratify that new agreement. But that is not all. With the creation of a network of parks in Patagonia, we have also added 4.5 million hectares of green areas, rich in biodiversity, which will now be protected by the State for public use. That shows that it is possible to move forward when there is will, when the public and private worlds join forces. Sustainable development is not a desire impossible to finance. On the contrary, it is the best way for economic activity to be sustained over time. But as I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is not the only dilemma. We also share pressing challenges in terms of democracy and inclusion. International experience has helped us and alerted us to the need to take charge of improving our democratic institutions, as well as transparency and probity in both politics and business, putting a brake on corruption. In that connection, we substantially modified the electoral system that we inherited from the dictatorship, making it more proportional and inclusive and guaranteeing a minimum quota of 40 per cent for female candidates. Along with that, we made changes to the regulations that govern the financing of electoral campaigns and political parties so that money does not define the outcome of elections. And we are in the process of a participatory drafting of a new constitution that is more modern and democratic. But we understand that strengthening our democracy is not enough if we do not respond to the demand for greater individual liberties and rights for people. That is why we have made decisive progress in expanding sexual and reproductive freedoms and rights. Of course, that movement towards higher levels of individual freedom must be accompanied by social policies that promote equality and solidarity and expand peopleâ??s capacities. That is why education is at the heart of our reforms. In less than four years, we have implemented important changes to ensure, on the one hand, that people will have the education they need and deserve, regardless of their socioeconomic situation, and, on the other, that Chile can count on professionals and technicians in the most important areas for its development. We have done that by enacting reforms from nursery school to higher education, and we have put public education at the centre of that movement. We are gradually increasing access to free education, first for lower-income families â?? next year, 60 per cent of our students will be have access to higher education free of charge â?? and then for the entire population. That is our way of promoting the idea that there can be no individual progress without collective progress, that there can be no lasting well-being where a few privileged groups become disconnected from the most disadvantaged. That is our way of realizing that well-being must be founded on a common link and universal values in order to become a reality. Lastly, with regard to the third definition we are called upon to understand, I unreservedly state that Chile maintains an unchanging strategic understanding of peace, democracy, human rights and the rights of migrants, and free trade. For that reason, I cannot help but mention the situation of our brother country Venezuela. Chile, together with 11 countries in the region, has called for credible dialogue between the Government and the opposition. We are prepared to play the role that Venezuelans deem appropriate in order to achieve good results in a peaceful, political and democratic manner. In the same vein, we are not the only ones to express our concern about the threats to peace in different parts of the world, such as the Middle East and areas of Africa and Eastern Europe, in particular with regard to the insistence on the use of nuclear weapons, which tests the very limits of peaceful coexistence. As we have publicly indicated, we hope that the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea will stop the nuclear tests, comply with the resolutions of the Security Council, contribute to guaranteeing lasting stability in North- East Asia and agree to resolve the situation through peaceful diplomatic and political channels. In that context, we actively participated in negotiations for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which we signed this morning. That historic act creates a standard that sets the basis for future negotiations, making it possible to completely eliminate nuclear weapons in a verifiable, irreversible manner. Along with that, I wish to express our pride and satisfaction at having participated for 13 years, with more than 12,000 men and women, in the troop and police contingents of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We have renewed our commitment to continuing to participate in cooperation with our specialized police in the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. Furthermore, as part of our policy on cooperation for development, Haiti has been made a priority partner, like the Caribbean and Central America, in programmes to improve institutions, security, enterprise and professional training. Along the same lines, I also wish to highlight the participation of Chilean observers in the peace process in Colombia, who are wrapping up the first special political mission and initiating the transition to the second. Chile also participated in the first stage of the process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and we are now participating as a garantor in conversations between the Colombian Government and the National Liberation Army. We do not believe only in the peaceful resolution of conflicts and disputes, but also in the enormous opportunities opened up by trade. We have worked intensely with our bilateral partners and with the Pacific Alliance to create what we call convergence in diversity. Latin American countries should come together on the basis of that which unites us instead of dwelling on our differences. That is to say, on each and every issue that pertains to international coexistence, we have affirmed, and will continue to reaffirm, our commitment to multilateralism and the existence of rules that guarantee the fair treatment of each country. Like other middle-income countries, my country faces major short- and medium-term challenges. That is why we value the multidimensional vision for development set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which recognize the differences between countries and gaps in development that are obscured when the only measurement of development is per capita income. Yet it appears that we are facing a contradiction. Middle-income countries, including many small island developing States in the Caribbean, are being graduated by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development solely for having passed the per-capita income criterion. Where, then, is the multidimensional criterion of the 2030 Agenda? Faced with that situation, Chile, together with other countries in the region, has spoken out and requested that a serious dialogue be initiated regarding the incorporation of multidimensional criteria in the definition of development. Together with Jamaica, we are launching a new initiative, the Resilient 20, which seeks to create an alliance to promote resilience in countries that are vulnerable to natural disasters, with a focus on middle-income countries but not limited to them. Faced with the challenges presented by governance of the international community, I reaffirm the value of this Assembly and this Organization. That is why we support the transformations promoted by Secretary- General AntÃ³nio Guterres for managing the Secretariat, which will facilitate decision-making in key sectors in both policy and administrative issues as well as promote confidence between Member States and the Organization. We have also supported the readjustments to the process of selecting and appointing the Secretary- General so as to make it more transparent and inclusive of all Member States. The long-awaited reform of the Security Council, to make it more democratically representative and fitting for the realities of the world today, is still pending. The world is seen differently from the South. While we still see vast sectors of our countries without access to the most basic public services, and when there is still hunger, segregation, precarious work and enormous inequality, there is only one conclusion: we have a long way to go for the agenda of solidarity to overcome the agenda of selfishness and indifference. It is true that some of those challenges are not exclusive to emerging countries â?? advanced democracies are also experiencing them. But the demands continue to be far more basic in the South. Chile has made major progress. In several areas we have reached standards that near those of developed countries, and we are proud of those gains. However, there are still many countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia that are facing histories of pain and frustration. We share with them a history of effort and hope that bonds us together in the present and the future. Because we have known scarcity, we know what it is to fight to break free of underdevelopment, as well as the fear of falling back into its grasp. We also know what it is to be a middle-income country with a healthy, solid economy yet with dramatic gaps in equality and opportunity for its inhabitants. We therefore know at first hand the need to make changes, but also that change must come about through solidarity, which we claim not only for individuals but also for peoples. To share, cooperate and collaborate is the first step in societies caring for themselves, to regard the present and the future with greater certainty. Today it is true that the needs of the global scene are different, but they are urgent and require historic efforts from one and from all. We must cooperate on the level of each country on projects coordinated between nations and guided by a clear agenda that inspires us all and to which we can all contribute.",1,196
7733,Session 72 - 2017,CHN_72_2017.txt,CHN_72_2017,72,2017,CHN,"The theme of the General Assembly at this yearâ??s session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is highly relevant, especially for an Organization that has made an exceptional contribution to peace and development. The United Nations has upheld its mission to support world peace by setting up a collective security mechanism, defusing regional hotspots and deploying peacekeepers. It has been instrumental in preventing full-scale wars and securing more than seven decades of relative peace for humankind. It has pursued its goals for development by setting a global development agenda and mobilizing resources worldwide. The United Nations has helped many developing countries onto a fast track to development, leading billions of people to modernization. But since the ideals of the United Nations have not yet been fully realized, countries must persist in their efforts. We live in an era defined by deepening trends towards a multipolar world, the collective emergence of emerging markets and developing countries, steady progress in globalization and the application of information technology, and an exciting new phase in the scientific and technological revolution. In humankindâ??s pursuit of greater development and prosperity, we see opportunities as never before. We are also living in a world that is witnessing profound changes in the international landscape and the balance of power. We see major threats, traditional and non-traditional, inadequate drivers of global growth and an increasing backlash against globalization. In our pursuit of lasting peace and sustainable development we are encountering unprecedented challenges. We are once again at a crossroads, so it is time to make the right choices between peace and war, openness and isolation, unity and division. Two years ago, from this rostrum, Xi Jinping, President of the Peopleâ??s Republic of China, called on us to foster a new form of international relations, based on win-win cooperation, with a view to building community and a shared future for humankind (see A/70/PV.13). President Xiâ??s vision is a great one, reflecting his firm grasp of the prevailing trends of our times. It is also Chinaâ??s answer to the question of the kind of future that humankind should build, and it is fully aligned with the purposes of the United Nations and the aspirations of its Member States. With the understanding and support of the international community, it can inspire us as a common goal. To ensure peace, development and dignity for all, we must embrace the spirit of the United Nations and move its work forward. The United Nations must continue to be the guardian of world peace, since the maintenance of peace and security is one of the core purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the primary mission of the Organization. The United Nations must encourage its members to live together in peace, as good neighbours, and to work to achieve shared, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. The five permanent members of the Security Council must play an exemplary role in rejecting conflict and confrontation in favour of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. All Member States should treat one another as equals, choosing dialogue over confrontation and partnerships over alliances in their relations. Credibility and justice must be upheld and efforts must be made to find common ground, manage differences and work to settle disputes peacefully and reasonably. We need a holistic approach to fighting terrorism. We must abide by the rule of law and avoid applying double standards. Terrorism should not be associated with any particular ethnic group or religion, and the United Nations should lead and coordinate efforts to build a global united front against it. Political solutions are the fundamental answer to hotspot issues. The parties to any conflict must stay committed to dialogue and negotiation, and the international community should work objectively and impartially to facilitate dialogue and promote peace, rather than stirring up trouble and making things more difficult. The United Nations should serve as the main channel for conflict prevention, make full use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and step up political mediation efforts. We are seeing some light on the horizon for a political settlement of the Syrian crisis. We should make good use of the Geneva and Astana channels and exert greater pressure for direct substantive talks between the Syrian Government and opposition. Alongside the talks, efforts must be made to achieve a cessation of hostilities, increase humanitarian assistance and launch post-war reconstruction in order to give people greater faith in peace talks. The Palestinian question has been bogged down on the United Nations agenda for 70 years, and the international community owes the Palestinians a long- overdue and just solution. All settlement activities in the occupied territories and all violence against civilians must end immediately. Concerted efforts should be made to advance a political resolution based on a two- State solution and to restart the peace talks as soon as possible. We must think out of the box with a view to facilitating peace through development and helping the people of the region to lay the groundwork for peace. The situation on the Korean peninsula is now a focus of international attention. Two days ago, on 19 September, we marked the twelfth anniversary of the 2005 joint statement of the Six-Party Talks. At the time, the six parties â?? China, as Chair, the United States, Russia, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and Japan â?? made concerted efforts, and the United States and the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, the two major parties involved, made political decisions. We formulated a road map for the denuclearization of the peninsula. The Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea undertook to abandon its nuclear programmes, and the United States to normalize its relations with the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. All the parties committed to setting up a permanent peace mechanism for the peninsula. The joint statement opened new vistas for regional peace and stability and inspired hope for a peaceful settlement to the dispute. Twelve years have passed. Some may think that the situation on the peninsula has changed and that the joint statement has become outdated, but we believe that things that follow progressive trends of the times are never outdated, and that decisions on the right side of history never become obsolete. If there has been any change, and if there is anything we need now, it is still denuclearization, but denuclearization that is more comprehensive, thorough and irreversible. There should be no new nuclear-weapon State, whether in the north or south of the peninsula, in North-East Asia or anywhere else in the world. We urge the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea not to continue along this dangerous path. We call on the United States to honour its formal commitment and on all the parties to play a constructive role in easing tensions. There is still hope for peace, and we must not give up. Negotiation is the only way out and deserves every effort. The parties should meet halfway by addressing one anotherâ??s legitimate concerns. In Chinaâ??s view, the day when the denuclearization of the peninsula is achieved should also be the day when a peace mechanism is established. China has always been a force for peace. We have worked tirelessly for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the peninsula. Whatever changes happen, however long it takes and whatever the difficulties we may face, China will stay firmly committed to the denuclearization of the peninsula, to dialogue and negotiations and to regional peace and stability. The United Nations must remain a champion of international development. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be its top priority in the field of development. It is important to encourage Member States to seek complementarity between the Agenda and their own development strategies, to eliminate hunger and poverty and to leave no one behind. We must ensure equitable, inclusive and quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all. We should enhance the role of North-South cooperation as the main channel for international development and cooperation, while leveraging South- South and tripartite cooperation. Climate change is a major factor to consider where the sustainable development of humankind is concerned. It will be crucial to ensure that the United Nations continues to work on the follow-up to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and to urge all parties to uphold the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equitability, and respective capabilities, and to reinforce international cooperation on climate issues. The problem of refugees is a result of regional instability and uneven development. The United Nations must respond to crises promptly through its humanitarian efforts. We must work to address the root causes of such problems by helping countries and regions to achieve development. Restoring the global economy to full recovery and growth continues to be an uphill task. The United Nations should promote the facilitation of liberalized trade and investment and work to build an open world economy. We must seize the opportunities that the newest phase of the scientific revolution presents, stay committed to reform, pursue innovation-driven development, find new spaces for development and foster a new development system. The United Nations must continue to be a pacesetter in global governance. As an organization at the core of the contemporary international system, it can accurately reflect the state of affairs in global governance. It should therefore follow current trends and work to make international relations more democratic, rules- based and equitable. Our Organization belongs to all of its 193 Member States, which are all equal, regardless of their size and wealth. The United Nations should therefore promote a spirit of democracy and ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities and follow the same rules in international affairs, enabling them to set international rules together, run global affairs together and share in development achievements together. At the same time, the United Nations should also constantly improve its institutions and mechanisms in order to uphold the interests of the majority of countries and to keep abreast of the evolving international landscape. It should promote the equal and uniform application of international law and stress the importance of fully and faithfully implementing it. It should urge all parties to observe the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, fulfil their responsibilities and obligations and keep the foundations of international law and order intact. Globalization is an unstoppable trend. It is not a choice between East and West. It should not follow the law of the jungle, much less a winner-take-all approach. The United Nations should uphold the principle of extensive consultations, joint contributions and shared benefits, and work to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. The United Nations must remain a facilitator of exchanges among civilizations. It is the diversity of its civilizations that gives our global village its vitality. We should raise awareness about the importance of that diversity and be eager to respect, protect and promote it. Civilizations can complement one another as they seek common ground and make progress together through exchanges and mutual learning. We should encourage our various civilizations, cultures and countries to flourish together through interaction and healthy competition. UNESCO and the Alliance of Civilizations have a large role to play in that regard. We should also encourage and respect the efforts of countries to choose development paths that suit their national conditions. Countries with different systems and paths should respect and learn from one another in order to make progress together. The United Nations should serve as a platform for harmonious coexistence between countries with different systems and as a bridge for dialogue and exchange. Chinaâ??s journey over the past five years has been a momentous one. Under the leadership of the eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China has made remarkable achievements on all fronts, and socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new and historic stage. As we looking to the future, Chinaâ??s continuous progress will bring to the world greater benefits of peace, development and governance. China is an anchor of world peace. Maintaining the stability of a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion people represents an enormous contribution to world peace. Aggression has never been in Chinese genes, and acts of colonization or plunder are nowhere to found in our history. President Xi has solemnly pledged that no matter how advanced Chinaâ??s development becomes, it will never seek hegemony or to expand or extend its sphere of influence. China will always vote for peace in the Security Council. China is an engine for development and prosperity. The Belt and Road Forum for international cooperation that China successfully hosted last May has produced more than 270 cooperation deliverables. China wants to make the Belt and Road a road to peace, prosperity, openness and innovation that connects different civilizations. This project of the century will offer a new paradigm for efforts to promote world peace and development. It will also inject fresh impetus into the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Starting next year, China will host the China International Import Expo, make even greater strides in its opening up and provide a new driving force for the global economy. China is a champion of multilateralism. It firmly upholds the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations; the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of countries; and the centrality of the United Nations in international affairs. No matter how the international landscape may change, China will stay firmly committed to multilateralism and will shoulder the responsibilities assigned it by the United Nations and will fulfil its due obligations to the world. The Communist Party of China will soon convene its nineteenth national congress. This will be a very important meeting held at a time when China is reaching a decisive stage in the completion of the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and a key phase in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It will open a new chapter in the pursuit of the Chinese dream. China will seek to realize its own dream in the context of the shared aspirations of all peoples of the world and continue to contribute to the development of all other countries through its own progress. Let us work together for a better future for humankind.",1,196
7734,Session 72 - 2017,CIV_72_2017.txt,CIV_72_2017,72,2017,CIV,"I would first like to express my condolences to the Mexican Government and people after the earthquake. I wish to express the gratitude of the Ivorian people for the great mobilization of countries gathered here that elected CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire to the Security Council for the term 2018-2019. That election demonstrates, if that were necessary, the Assemblyâ??s support for my countryâ??s ongoing commitment to peace and dialogue. It is also a call to share with the the Assembly and the world our experience in managing the emergence from a crisis and in effective cooperation with the United Nations, as evidenced by the success of the United Nations Operation in CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire. That peacekeeping operation, with its lessons learned, has been acknowledged by all as one of the few peacekeeping successes of our global Organization in the past few decades. It should serve as inspiration to the United Nations in its peace initiatives. That is why CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council â?? which status was just conferred by the Assembly â?? intends to promote fair and pragmatic compromises in the settlement of crises on the Councilâ??s agenda. In a world experiencing severe geopolitical turbulence and climate change, the theme of our session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is a call to action to strengthen peace in the world. We must conceive of a development model that is better balanced among the countries and more just among people. This theme us an urgent challenge to save our planet so that we can build the virtuous world we want for ourselves and for future generations. From the discussions we held with all countries as we sought to promote our candidacy for the Security Council, we noted that there is an urgent need to respond to new global threats in order to achieve a lasting peace for all. More than ever before, it is time to act and to fulfil our commitments, so as to meet the expectations of our peoples with regard to security and development. Since 2001, the global counter-terrorism architecture that our Organization set up has become considerably stronger in terms of law and the coordination of international action. Despite those encouraging developments, and the success of anti-terrorist operations by major Powers and their allies in the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, in Africa, the world is struggling to find a satisfactory collective response to terrorism. Under such conditions, those important successes will be in vain and the terrorist threat will remain a source of concern if Africa continues to be the weak link in the global fight against terrorism. The major Powers must intensify their commitment to combating terrorism in Africa and must provide greater support to the efforts of the continent and the United Nations. We call for support for the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), whose work is essential for the security of a large part of the African continent. For its part, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire will make support for the G5 Sahel and fighting terrorism in Africa one of the priorities during its term on the Security Council, since without stability there can be no development. Global warming is a real concern. No country is immune to the devastating effects of climate phenomena, which are jeopardizing our countriesâ?? peoples and economies. We must therefore act quickly and responsibly if we are to preserve our environment and our planet. With regard to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, my Government will live up to its signing of it and will seek, inter alia, energy transitions, the development of smart agriculture and the preservation and protection of the environment. It is urgent that every country, like CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, uphold its commitments voluntarily agreed to under the Paris Climate Agreement. In the same vein, developed countries must honour their commitments to finance the adaptation of the economies of the countries in the South to the impact of global warming. We must also be sensitive to the plight of many small island States. We must consider climate change a real threat to international peace and security. We must urgently take the right steps, including by adopting an international pact for the environment, which has been proposed by France. Maintaining peace and security in the world also requires strict management of the issue of nuclear weapons. We must do our utmost within the Security Council to find a peaceful solution to the serious nuclear tensions in the Korean peninsula. Any use of nuclear weapons in that region would demonstrate the moral bankruptcy of our civilization and the end of the era we are living in. It would run the risk of a nuclear conflict with unforeseeable consequences. I therefore call on the major Powers to show restraint and to enter into dialogue with North Korea, in order to create the conditions for a lasting de-escalation and to reassure the world with regard to maintaining peace and stability in that region. All efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking and smuggling have not put an end to those phenomena, which continue to engulf thousands of young people from African countries in the Mediterranean. On the contrary, they have contributed to the weakening of democracy and a rise of extremist feelings, even in established Western democracies. To put an end to those dangerous migrations, developed countries, in particular countries and regions that receive migrants, must mobilize investments and resources needed to finance development in migrantsâ?? countries of origin and transit so that their economies are able to offer jobs and opportunities to their youth. The fight against people smugglers in countries of origin should also be intensified. Furthermore, the international community must put an end to the war in Libya and dismantle terrorist groups and smugglersâ?? networks that continue to traffic in human beings. In CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, the response to this scourge is focused on prevention by increasing awareness and assistance with return for those who attempt migration, as well as dismantling smuggling networks. The fight against illegal migration must respect existing international legal obligations that guarantee respect for the human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all migrants. Building a peaceful and secure world remains our priority. Despite a difficult economic situation marked by a sudden drop in the price of cocoa, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire intends to honour its commitments in the framework of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the context of its priority development goals, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire has reached an average annual growth rate of 9 per cent per year over the past five years, thanks to sound macroeconomic policy, the work of Ivoirians, an improved business environment and significant investment. We are now working to effectively distribute the fruit of that growth, particularly to the most destitute and the most vulnerable segments, all while seeking to transform the country. That is the essence of the 2016- 2020 national development programme and of the bold social reforms led by my Government. I would like to make an urgent appeal to all States and civil society organizations so that the international mobilization for the implementation of the SDGs does not fade. Developed nations must honour their commitments by contributing to financing for development in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third International Conference on Financing for Development. We must face the fact that the individual and, above all, collective responses of our countries to the main security challenges of our time are insufficient, even if we have achieved significant results in the fight against terrorism in certain theatres. The fact of the matter is that our world is vulnerable and no State can face the global threat alone. The rise of terrorism, the devastating effects of global warming and the persistence of nuclear tension, particularly in the Korean peninsula, have sorely tested our collective security architecture. We must therefore agree on the ways to strengthen and modernize it so as to enable our countries to respond jointly and effectively to the serious threats of our times. We must also afford pride of place to conflict prevention in order to spare our people the exorbitant human and material cost of war. In that connection, I welcome the implementation of the Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for an Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security, which will allow both institutions to work together closely during all stages of the cycle of conflict in a predictable, systematic and strategic manner. Our Organization is at an important turning point in its history. It is facing significant challenges in the carrying out of its mission. It is therefore timely for my country to pledge its full support for the reforms called for by Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, and to renew our faith in him. His reforms are steps in the right direction. They ought to be pursued in that same spirit, with the support of all countries. CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire is ready to write a new page in its history at the United Nations after its election to the Security Council, thanks to the support of all. We must continue to work together in the interest of our Organization in order to advance the priority causes of our peoples.",1,196
7735,Session 72 - 2017,CMR_72_2017.txt,CMR_72_2017,72,2017,CMR,"I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I am sure that your rich experience will serve us well in successfully steering our deliberations. You can count on the full cooperation of my delegation. My congratulations also go to Ambassador Peter Ð¢homson, your predecessor and the architect of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, on his commendable record. Lastly, I would like, once again, to congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his unanimous election as Secretary-General of our Organization. He can count on the continuing support of Cameroon as he carries out his important and complex tasks. This session is being held in a global context of multiple hotbeds of tension all over the world, in which terrorism continues to claim thousands of victims, human activity is causing climate disruptions and poverty is far from declining. But it is also taking place in parallel with laudable efforts aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is designed to ensure humankindâ??s development in such a way that no one will be left behind. That explains the full relevance of this general debate under the theme â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Our debates, especially our conclusions, will be a litmus test of our commitment to the ideals of the peoples of the United Nations, who, in the Preamble to the Charter, have stated their resolve to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and create better standards of living for all people. For Cameroon and most of our States, peace is the sine qua non for the survival of humankind and sustainable development. The peace we have continues to be dangerously threatened, notably by terrorism, conflicts, poverty and climate disruptions. Today we are all, I would say, supplicants for peace, and such persistent threats are of enormous concern to all of us. Today, no continent or country is spared the scourge of terrorism, whose atrocities have, unfortunately, become part and parcel of our daily lives. Let me cite a few examples, In August 2017, attacks took place in Barcelona and Ouagadougou; in July 2016, a Baghdad bombing left 292 dead; in October 2015, the crash of a Russian Airbus in the Sinai left 224 dead; a March 2015 attack on mosques in Sanaâ??a left 142 dead; and in November 2015 attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis left 130 dead. Maiduguri, Kolofata and Fotokol are place names that conjure up only dead, nameless and faceless bodies. The number of victims of the Boko Haram terrorist sect in the Lake Chad basin is estimated to be 2,000. Cameroon and other neighbouring countries have been dealing with that sect, which changes its methods and tactics daily, and we appreciate the support of our partners in the fight against such barbarism. The fight against Boko Haram, a jihadist sect, will need more widespread mobilization if we really want to stamp it out. It is killing our peoples, our communities, our independence and our democracy. It spells death for peace. In that regard, we look forward to the forthcoming visit to the Lake Chad region of the high-level mission led by the Secretary-General and mandated by the Security Council under resolution 2349 (2017). We deplore the continuing conflicts in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, which are wreaking pain and hardship â?? so many dead, so many refugees and displaced persons, so many children wandering without a roof over their heads and facing uncertain, even shattered futures. Cameroon, which has hosted and continues to host thousands of Central African and Nigerian refugees, understands the degree to which they feel hurt, victimized and threatened in their very existence. Let us therefore mobilize, and through our policies, behaviours and actions, let us refocus on people. Peace is under threat, not only from terrorism and conflicts, but also from persistent poverty. The Security Council has rightly reiterated that poverty is a serious threat. Why, then, do we have such difficulty tackling it accordingly? The numerous declarations and resolutions, the various United Nations development decades and the plans of action and other agendas adopted by the United Nations have not really been effective, and the result is clear. Poverty persists, and the gap between rich and poor countries is continues to widen. The situation has been aggravated by a decline in commodity prices. Let us galvanize ourselves in a powerful surge of solidarity to roll back poverty. Let us match our words with our actions and thereby create the conditions for a decent life for our peoples. Let us therefore focus on people. We must, for present and future generations, save our planet. We therefore welcome the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which Cameroon, I would like to point out, was among the first countries to sign and ratify. We are pleased that steps are being taken to implement it effectively. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the legitimate and unanimous desire of developing countries. As we all know, they pollute less and should therefore receive resources from the rich countries, which pollute more, to enable them to effectively promote the goals of the Paris Agreement at their level. Africa has two major environmental challenges. The first is the ongoing forest degradation in Central Africa. Let us save the Congo basin, which is planet Earthâ??s second lung. Secondly, there is desertification, which is causing Lake Chad to disappear. That vast body of water, essential to the survival of communities and biodiversity, has already lost 90 per cent of its former surface area. Let us save Lake Chad and thereby help to preserve the planet for the greater good of humankind. The quest for peace concerns all of us. All countries must join forces to achieve peace. Is it not high time then for the voice of poor countries, especially those of Africa, to be heard? Is it not high time that Africaâ??s message to the world was better taken into account? Is it not high time that we structured our Organization to give more weight to Africaâ??s voice within a revitalized General Assembly and a Security Council that is more receptive and more even-handed to us? A world characterized by greater solidarity is the prerequisite for peace on Earth. In conclusion, peace is our most precious asset. Without it, we cannot undertake sustainable and effective initiatives in the interest of our peoples, especially our young people. The theme of this debate aptly reminds us of the commitment of the founding fathers of the United Nations, that is, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and ensure a decent life for all, free from want, through cooperation. This debate urges us to renew our faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Let us together take up the great challenge of world peace and development. Once again, Cameroon, as it did from this very rostrum on 10 September 2000, urges the world to rally together in one great coalition for humankind, which must restore to the centre of our policies. For its sake, let us secure peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet.",1,196
7736,Session 72 - 2017,COD_72_2017.txt,COD_72_2017,72,2017,COD,"I wish to express my very warm congratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, which is an acknowledgement of your distinguished career as a diplomat and a tribute to your country, Slovakia. I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for his leadership and efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization during this first year of his term of office. The theme of this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? responds to the concerns of the moment in most of the States Members of the Organization. I am pleased with it, as it is consistent with the logic of the Sustainable Development Goals and because, for my country, peace, stability and the improvement of our peopleâ??s living conditions are the Governmentâ??s priorities. Seventy-two years ago the Organization was born out of the ambition to reform relations among States on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality and the desire to guarantee peace and prosperity for all. That ambition remains relevant and is carried forward every day by the commitment of women and men who are determined to see it fulfilled, sometimes at the risk of their lives. In the face of the rise of terrorism in various forms, it is indisputable that the world to which we aspire depends on how we address peace and security issues. For the past year, my country has been the victim of terrorist attacks, especially in the Kasai provinces and even in the capital, by certain armed groups whose objective is to destroy the peace so dearly acquired, so as to thwart the dynamics of consensus-based problem-solving at the national level and to undermine our development efforts. In the Kasai, a mystico-tribal militia is using the civilian population, including children, as human shields and is attacking people and public buildings that symbolize the authority of the State. It is thereby sowing terror â?? decapitating law-enforcement officers, agents of the Independent National Electoral Commission, and administrative and traditional authorities. Those were the circumstances of deplorable barbarity in which the two United Nations experts lost their lives in March. We are determined to make sure that light is shed on the exact circumstances of that crime so that that horrible act, as well as those to which our countrymen have been subjected, will not go unpunished. That is why public trials were begun several weeks ago, following the arrest of most of those presumed to be guilty. That was also the purpose of the recent conference on peace, reconciliation and development, which aimed to establish the truth of what really happened in those central provinces of the country, to promote reconciliation among the people of those provinces and to affirm our belief that all reconciliation necessarily involves justice and that there can be no real and lasting peace without justice. My country remains open to all forms of collaboration on that subject. Thanks to that approach, which combines the restoration of State authority, dialogue and restorative justice, we have been able to reverse the dangerous trend in the security situation in the centre of the country, which has improved very significantly. In the eastern part of the country, laudable efforts by the national defence and security forces have in turn allowed us to contain the terrorist attacks of the Allied Democratic Forces, which plagued our populations daily. We are convinced that the subregional cooperation initiative involving my country, South Sudan and the Central African Republic will also allow us to halt the terrorist threat posed by the Lordâ??s Resistance Army. Our participation in the process should be seen as evidence of our determination in the coalitionâ??s fight against that threat. With regard to combating sexual violence, I welcome the outstanding progress recorded by the courts, which have handed down hundreds of convictions for rape. No one has been spared from prosecution because of social position or military rank, which is proof that impunity in that area has ended. Two years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is not too early to begin monitoring its implementation. In carrying out its commitments, my country has begun the process of prioritizing the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development in elaborating and implementing its national development plan. More specifically, in support of the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, my country has been focusing on expanding access and equity, improving the quality of teaching and learning and improving governance in the educational sector. We are are pleased with the increased access of girls to schools. Over 10 years, their enrolment rate has increased from 70 per cent to nearly 105 per cent. We are implementing plans to build thousands of schools, without neglecting in-depth reforms in that area. Climate change is one of our greatest concerns, as it is a threat to humankind and our fundamental rights. Every State has the responsibility to contribute to limiting its impact. My country and the other countries in the Congo basin â?? home to the second-largest forest reserve in the world â?? are equipped, through the Central African Forest Commission, to help improve the quality of life on our planet. For its part, my country intends to uphold all of its commitments, beginning with the ratification of the Paris Agreement, which is now under way. Like peace, political stability is for us a constant objective of our domestic policy. In that vein, for nearly a year we have been engaging in a dialogue that for us is a standing method of settling political disputes. In that connection, I would like to pay tribute to the African Union and other regional organizations. We are grateful for their support in that process. I also welcome the efforts of all the political forces in my country who, in the search for a comprehensive consensus on the electoral process, arrived at the agreement of 31 December 2016, the ultimate aim of which is the holding of elections. At the request of all stakeholders for a new electoral register, voter registration has been under way for more than a year now. The last phase has just begun in the last two provinces in the centre of the country. We are pleased that more than 42 million voters of the projected 45 million have already been registered. In addition, a series of evaluations of the electoral process was started some 10 days ago by the National Monitoring Council, jointly with the Government and the Electoral Commission, which should allow for the publication of the electoral calendar by the Commission, which is the only competent institution in that regard. Despite that progress, however, the challenges of organizing elections in my country remain enormous in terms of logistics, finances, security and legislation. We are confronting those obstacles with humility, but also with indisputable tenacity. Given the advances that have been made, I affirm that we are moving towards credible, transparent and peaceful elections and that our progress in that direction is irreversible, all without external interference or any fiats. I ask the true friends of my country to sincerely support our ongoing electoral process. The Charter of the United Nations imposes obligations on us, including striving to building a better world. For that reason, the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintains a strategic dialogue with the United Nations on the future of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolution. That strategic review should determine the pace of the reduction of the MONUSCO force until its full withdrawal. It is clear that, after almost 20 years of deployment, the United Nations force cannot expect to stay in my country indefinitely or to exercise its mandate in the same format and without drawing lessons from the weaknesses that have been identified. What is important to us, and what should be important to everybody, is the credibility of the Organization and the effectiveness of the contribution of United Nations troops on the ground. That is why, for several years now, we have been requesting the adjustment of the MONUSCO force to suit its dynamic missions, and the reorientation of resources thus freed up towards meeting our development needs. In that area, as in others, we do not intend to compromise on the respect due to the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is guaranteed by the Charter of the Organization. I would like to believe that all who place their hopes in the United Nations â?? including my country â?? will fully commit to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and to the long-awaited reform of the Organization. I wish the Assembly every success in its work.",1,196
7737,Session 72 - 2017,COG_72_2017.txt,COG_72_2017,72,2017,COG,"At the outset, I would like to express my sincerest condolences to the people and the Government of Mexico in the wake of the earthquake that was so devastating for that country. On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I would like to extend to the President our heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also express our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, to whom we pay warm tribute for the work accomplished. We also once again wish Secretary-General Guterres every success in the fulfilment of his mandate. I note with interest the great significance of the theme of this general debate. Indeed, focusing on people and striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet is a tremendous challenge that calls for a spirit of openness and responsibility on all our parts. Humankind faces many challenges. Terrorism is spreading its reach daily. No continent is immune to violence perpetrated in the name of extremism and nationalism. The increased tensions on the Korean peninsula could lead to nuclear conflict on an unprecedented scale. The situations in Syria and Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the nuclear threat and the crises in Africa and other parts of the world mean that there is now a pressing moral need for peace, without which nothing constructive or sustainable can be built. That has always been our guiding light. Whenever circumstances allow, the Congo has always seized every opportunity to uphold the ideals of peace and justice in Africa and across the world. It is in that context that, on 19 October, my country will host the next Summit of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the seventh High- Level Meeting of the Follow-up Mechanism of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. The Summit will provide an opportunity to consider ways and means of resolving the various crises that currently afflict that part of our continent. In addition, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in the Great Lakes region are confronted with various crises. I refer in particular to the Central African Republic, Burundi and South Sudan. In the case of the Central African Republic, the return to peace is moving forward apace. The Government and the people of the Congo are unwavering in their support for the people of the Central African Republic. The implementation of the Road Map for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic, adopted in July under the auspices the African Union, should provide new impetus to the stabilization of that fraternal country. Moreover, the search for solutions for an effective exit from the crisis in Libya as part of the mandate entrusted by the African Union to the Congo is unquestionably moving in the right direction. The holding of the fourth meeting of the African Union High-level Committee on Libya on 1 September in Brazzaville led to quite heartening progress. All major stakeholders in the Libyan crisis and members of the dialogue committees set up by the Libyans themselves travelled to Brazzaville during or just after the Summit. A final communiquÃ© and road map were adopted at the end of the meeting. The commission for inter-Libyan dialogue has begun its discussions, and they will essentially focus on the amendment of the Libyan Political Agreement adopted in Skhirat on 17 December 2015 and the inter-Libyan conference that is to take place in Addis Ababa in December. From this rostrum, I would like to reiterate my countryâ??s resolve to continue working for peace in Libya. That is why I urge the international community to support the efforts of the Congo to strengthen initiatives conducive to a positive outcome for those various crises. Undoubtedly, poverty will continue to pose a lasting global challenge until we break the cycle of dependence and dramatic contingencies that has been caused by disturbing changes of natural ecosystems. In that respect, the globalizing and interdependent nature of our response is undeniable. Beyond our differences, we must draw on the regulatory capacities of the great Powers, in conjunction with the search for adapted paradigms and more effective solidarity aimed at advancing the developing economies. Our global stability depends upon that. In that particular context, Africa has been affected by the tragedy of emigration across the Mediterranean Sea. Similarly, the forced displacement of populations towards more hospitable areas, as a result of climate change, gives a measure of the distress of men, women and children â?? all victims. It is a matter of concern to us all. We must take significant action in a spirit of solidarity and mutual understanding so as to contain those exoduses towards uncertainty and save the lives of thousands of Africans. As a truly global issue, the climate was the subject of promising discussions regarding its future at the Paris Conference in 2015. It is urgent that the commitments made there be kept. For the collective consciousness of humankind, that is the place to express our compassion and solidarity with the populations that are victim to the harmful consequences of climate change. I refer specifically to the devastating effects of Hurricane Irma in North America and the floods and landslides in Asia and some African countries, particularly in Sierra Leone. Once again, we must agree that the protection of the environment is a common and imperative obligation. In that context, my country initiated the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin on the sidelines of the twenty- second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The memorandum of understanding that was signed last March in Oyo, the Congo, marks the first step in the Fundâ??s creation. That financial instrument aims to ensure a better quality of life for our people and protect the forests of the Congo basin, which is the second-largest green lung in the world after the Amazon. I invite the international community to support the Congo in that initiative aimed at protecting our planet from global warming. A decent life for all also means allowing our populations to benefit from high-quality health care. The proliferation of counterfeit and sub-standard medicines is an increasingly serious threat to the world, particularly for developing countries. The expansion of that scourge brings to mind various carefully organized forms of trafficking that have helped to finance terrorism. According to the World Health Organization, counterfeit medicines lead to 800,000 deaths a year. Approximately 10 per cent of medicines in circulation worldwide are estimated to be counterfeit. In Africa and the countries of the South in general, that figure may reach 40 per cent, and even 60 per cent in some regions. In addition to the efforts of the World Health Organization, vigorous action at the level of the General Assembly should be undertaken with a view to defining a comprehensive strategy to combat the peril. Advocacy in that area requires the constant mobilization of all countries, including sustained attention and substantial financial allocations. For our part, my country has engaged in the fight in collaboration with the Brazzaville Foundation for Peace and Conservation. The Republic of the Congo is experiencing a period that is marked by socioeconomic concern for the drastic decrease in oil prices. Budgetary adjustments are now envisaged, with the support of international financial institutions. In spite of the dismal situation, the Congo continues its resolute march towards the consolidation of its democracy. More than ever, the virtues of constructive dialogue are being brought into play. An institutional framework was implemented after the presidential, legislative, local and senatorial elections. The stakeholders of the nation are exercising their rights in complete freedom. Transforming the world into a haven of peace and prosperity is possible. We are given proof of that with every passing day. It is up to us to realize that goal, while leaving no one behind.",1,196
7738,Session 72 - 2017,COL_72_2017.txt,COL_72_2017,72,2017,COL,"This is the eighth and last time I address the General Assembly in my capacity as President of Colombia. A lot has happened since 24 September 2010, when I made my first speech (see A/65/PV.15). Colombia has been transformed positively, and the world has experienced progress and setbacks, of which we have all been witnesses, victims or protagonists. Here is a paradox: I did my first televised address to Colombians as their leader from New York in September 2010, one day before addressing the Assembly. What was the reason for that intervention? I announced to Colombia and to the international community that our armed forces had taken down the head of the guerrillas of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). Today, seven years later, I feel very happy that the news I bring from Colombia does not have to do with death, but with life. Today I come to tell the Assembly that the peace process with the FARC culminated not only in an agreement, but with something bigger and more important: thousands and thousands of human lives saved. Therefore, the news today is not about death. It is about life, and we want that to be the news in the whole world. If in Colombia we were able to end an armed conflict that left hundreds of thousands dead and millions as victims and displaced persons, there is hope for the conflicts that still exist in the world. It was not easy. Ending a war, overcoming hatred and vanquishing fears involve a complex process of dialogue and compromise. However, we did it because we had the will and because we were aware of a fundamental premise: peace is a necessary condition for progress and the happiness of any society. I want to acknowledge and thank the United Nations, because it has fully fulfilled the mission for which it was created, which is none other than to end the scourge of war. On behalf of some 50 million Colombians, I want to thank the Secretary-General, the Security Council and the Assembly. A special mission set up by the Security Council was in charge of verifying and monitoring the FARC disarmament process and its compliance with the ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities between that group and the Colombian State. Today we can say, with immense satisfaction, that its mission has been fulfilled. The ceasefire and cessation of hostilities were respected, and the FARC delivered to the United Nations more than 9,000 weapons that were stored in containers. Those weapons are being destroyed. The members of that former guerrilla group â?? without detriment to their responsibilities with regard to justice and to the victims â?? have now formed a political movement to defend their ideas and proposals in the forums of democracy. That is what a peace process is all about: replacing violence with reasoning, exchanging bullets for votes. Never again will arms be used as a means of political pressure. Now we are faced with the challenge of implementing what has been agreed and guaranteeing victimsâ?? rights to truth, justice, reparations and non-repetition. In that regard, we can once again count on the friendly hand of the United Nations. In a few days, a second mission, authorized last week by the Security Council, will begin operations in our country. It will accompany the reintegration of guerrillas into civilian life and will help us to verify the safety of ex-combatants and the communities that have suffered from the armed conflict. And something very important: the United Nations will also verify compliance with the ceasefire and the temporary cessation of hostilities, which will begin 1 October, by the EjÃ©rcito de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional, the other guerrilla group with which we are in negotiations to achieve a complete peace. Building peace is a long process with political, economic and social dimensions. It is a process in which, fortunately, we have already had positive results. With innovative programmes in education, health, housing and infrastructure, we are beginning to close the deep social gaps of our society. The Economic Commission for Latin America has highlighted Colombiaâ??s progress in reducing poverty and indigence. In seven years, more than 5 million Colombians overcame poverty â?? that is more than a tenth of our population. We have turned health into a fundamental right, and education has been our highest budgetary priority for the past four years, above security and defence. International organizations also highlight the soundness of our economic and social indicators in the face of fluctuations in the global economy. This is indeed a special moment for Colombia, and a special moment for the United Nations, which is successfully fulfilling, in our country, its main objective. But this time of hope in Colombia does not prevent us from viewing with concern the difficult situations for peace and democracy in other parts of the planet. We emphatically deplore and condemn the ballistic- missile launches and the nuclear tests of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. Those actions are a threat to international peace and security. We are very concerned about the precarious situation in our sister and neighbour Republic of Venezuela, with which we share an immense border, a common history and human ties that do not allow us to be indifferent to its fate. Venezuela pains us. We are pained at the gradual destruction of its democracy. We are pained at the persecution of the political opposition and the systematic violation of the rights of Venezuelans. Today I repeat my call on the Secretary-General and the entire international community to support the Venezuelan people in the search for a peaceful solution that will return them to the path of progress, democracy and freedom. We are also pained at the terrorist attacks carried out by intolerant fanatics, sowing fear and pain, and we condemn them. On that topic I would like to speak in two capacities: as President of the only country where instead of increasing weaponry we melt them to build monuments to harmony, and as the most recent Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Beyond the differences of race, religion and thought, human beings are actually one. What happens to one happens to us all. We have to understand that beyond divisions, beyond borders, our people is called the world. Our race is called humankind. We must understand this truth if we are to respect one another and respect life. We must fight terrorism forcefully â?? with military and police power, with intelligence and international cooperation. But we must also eradicate its roots, which are fear, exclusion and hatred, with the positive forces of love, compassion and respect for differences. In Colombia we are proving that it is possible; war can be overcome. Ancient enemies can speak and work together for a greater cause. If we are succeeding in Colombia, it can be done all over the world. I cannot conclude without addressing an issue that I have highlighted before at this rostrum: the world drug problem. I have said many times that the war on drugs has not been won and is not being won, that we need new approaches and new strategies. At the General Assemblyâ??s thirtieth special session, on the world drug problem â?? which met last year at the initiative of Colombia â?? there was progress, such as the call for States to protect human rights in their drug policies. But we still have a great deal to do. We must reach consensus on central issues, such as not criminalizing addicts and understanding drug use as a matter of public health and not criminal policy. The war on drugs has claimed too many lives. We in Colombia have paid a very high price, perhaps the highest of any nation, and what we are seeing is that the remedy is often worse than the disease. Let us undertake a serious and rigorous follow-up of the regulatory experiences that have been implemented in different places and learn from both their successes and their difficulties. It is time to accept realistically that as long as there is consumption there will be supply, and that consumption will not end. It is not a simplistic matter of pointing out who is solely responsible. We all are, under the principle of the common and shared responsibility that we assumed several decades ago. It is time to talk about responsible regulation by States, to seek ways to weaken the mafias and to confront consumption with more resources for prevention, care and reduction of damage to health and to the social fabric. Colombia will continue to fight this scourge decisively. For us it has been and continues to be a matter of national security. Peace has allowed us for the first time to initiate the process of voluntary substitution of coca crops. Those processes, along with the forced eradication we are promoting and the seizures, which have increased to unprecedented levels, will allow us to achieve results that are even more conclusive and long-term. But we must advance in this struggle with a more open mind. We have to be smarter and more innovative. We can say much the same about climate change. Colombia, the most biodiverse country in the world for its size, is also one of the most vulnerable to climate change. That is why we have been proactive on this matter. At the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development we pushed for the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, which the Assembly approved in 2015. Today we are pleased to see that those Goals are the backbone of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promoted by the United Nations. We also enthusiastically support the Paris Climate Agreement, whose goals are a national commitment and should be for all if we want to preserve our common home â?? the Earth. Humankind cannot close its eyes in the face of the most pressing challenge of our times. In this, my last statement before the General Assembly, I want to offer the world â?? with humility and much gratitude â?? the example and model of peace that we are beginning to build in Colombia. And I want to reiterate our gratitude for the international communityâ??s generous support. With the strength of love we can overcome fear. With the strength of life we can overcome the tyranny of violence and death. With the strength of unity we can make the world a decent place to live.",1,196
7739,Session 72 - 2017,COM_72_2017.txt,COM_72_2017,72,2017,COM,"It is an honour to once again address the General Assembly. On this occasion, I would first like to join those who have spoken before me in this Hall to express the great compassion that the people and the Government of my country, the Union of the Comoros, feel for the people and the Government of the United States of America, the host country of the Assembly, in the aftermath of the hurricane that recently devastated Texas. As an island State, I would also like to extend our greatest sympathy to the French Government and the peoples and islands of the Caribbean for both the heavy loss of life and the magnitude of material damage wrought by Hurricane Irma. Those repeated natural catastrophes are a resonating call to climate sceptics to remind them that now is the time for commitment and action if we wish to mitigate, as far as possible, the causes of such devastating threats linked to global warming. I would also like to associate the voice of the Comoros with those who spoke earlier today to express our deepest condolences and full solidarity to the Government and the people of Mexico following the violent earthquake that recently struck the heart of Mexico, causing hundreds of deaths and disappearances, as well as tremendous damage. Allow me to commend the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to voice true optimism for success in our work under his leadership as a seasoned statesman. His predecessor, His Excellency Peter Thomson, also merits the admiration and gratitude of my delegation and all others for his remarkable energy in accomplishing his mission during the previous session. To Secretary-General Guterres and to all Members of our prestigious institution, we reiterate our readiness to make our modest contribution towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the upholding of peace and security, for which the United Nations is constantly working with selflessness and devotion. My country, the Union of the Comoros, on behalf of which I speak, appreciates the responsibility borne by the international community in the light of the gravity of the situation throughout the world and the concerns plaguing people in many countries. I would therefore like to voice our commitment to the United Nations and commend its efforts to tackle present-day challenges and threats to peace, stability and collective prosperity. I welcome the relevance of the theme selected for this seventy-second session, which enables us to highlight the increasingly evident link between the environment, peace and security. Here, I would like to reiterate our tribute to the Governments of France and Morocco for the work accomplished at the twenty-first and twenty-second sessions of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, encouraging each of our countries, particularly island States, to give utmost priority to everything that has to do with the survival of our planet. The general theme of our discussion today focuses on people, the striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, and it incorporates many issues that lie at the heart of the concerns of the international community. They include migration, preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, sustainable development and United Nations reform. Speaking about the human being also implies a reference to human rights, including human dignity, which are an uppermost priority for our Organization. Global warming, migrations, conflicts, wars and terrorism are all challenges that all continents, and Africa in particular, are facing and require urgent responses. Terrorism, which represents the absolute repudiation of the human being, has become a scourge that we condemn and that we must fight mercilessly on a global scale with all our strength. In that regard, I call for the rejection of the dangerous confusion and unfortunate association between the terms â??terrorismâ?? and â??Islamâ??. There is no Islamic terrorism, just as there is no Christian or Jewish terrorism. Terrorists belong to no faith. Terrorists are simply barbarians. My country, the Union of the Comoros, which I have the honour to lead, is a country whose people are educated in the practices of a religion, Islam, which advocates love of oneâ??s neighbour, tolerance and respect for human dignity. Those principles fly in the face of the cowardly, barbaric acts committed by groups acting faithlessly and lawlessly. By no means can they be associated with our religion. We vehemently condemn the atrocities targeting minorities and communities â?? yesterday, unfortunately, in Bosnia and Herzegovina against Muslims and today in Burma against the Rohingyas, as well as atrocities perpetrated against minorities throughout the world. The inhumane and savage nature of such attacks is a shock to our conscience as we see attempts at ethnic cleansing committed against the poorest segments of society. I dare hope that our Organization will be able to uphold the most basic rights of the oppressed, regardless of origin, race, gender and creed. What priority do we attach to the human being in the face of such ghastly scenes where human rights are trampled upon on a daily basis? The international community must absolutely act to end such acts and punish the perpetrators, at the risk of losing credibility before the people whose eyes are riveted on our institution, which has the right, duty and ability to provide them with protection, dignity and well-being. It is by guaranteeing peace, security and human rights that we can collectively promote the SDGs, especially for a decent existence, health for all, gender equality and education for new generations. Technological possibilities present immense potential for our young people. Goal 7 of the SDGs is geared to ensuring universal access to reliable, sustainable and modern energy services at an affordable cost. The lack of widespread access to electricity is a hindrance to sustainable growth, particularly in Africa. In the Union of the Comoros, in one year, we managed to end the electricity shortages and constant load- shedding that had plagued our economy, our businesses and our homes, and to emerge from a protracted energy crisis. However, now that the emergency is over, we need to ensure that those results can be made long-term through a medium- and long-term energy policy and through the development of renewable energy with a low-carbon footprint. To succeed in that and achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we must rely on ourselves and our own resources above all. However, we need international solidarity, but also the solidarity of industrialists, bankers and international investors. The Union of the Comoros has returned to political stability after witnessing three peaceful transfers of power at the highest State level over the past 15 years. Today, we are offering an incentive policy and support measures with a more attractive investment code. My country, as a small island developing State, is subject to myriad risks. Nevertheless, my Governmentâ??s determination to work for the well-being of our people has prompted us to set a goal of making the Union of the Comoros an emerging country by 2030. There is great optimism driving us forward, and we hope that indicators will soon attest to our progress towards that ambitious and lofty goal. The main thrusts of our Government converge on the achievement of that goal, which is underpinned by a national development strategy. Furthermore, there is a great deal of work under way to endow my country in the near future with adequate resources in terms of energy, road, port and airport infrastructure, economic recovery and the establishment of a framework for consultations. That will bring the private and public sectors closer together and will afford opportunities for civil society and political parties to fully play their roles. For that reason, at the initiative of the elders and leaders of our country, we have launched an inclusive dialogue among the various components and forces of the Comorian nation. There are plans to hold a national forum in December to take stock of our 42 years of independence. That is an inclusive, broadened national framework, one that includes all national life forces. Its mission is to assess the past, draw lessons from it and plan for a better future under better conditions. I have therefore unreservedly embraced this participatory, inclusive and representative approach, and the debates will lead to conclusions on everything that will strengthen the peace, security, calm and stability of the country and determine its future by drawing lessons from the past. In order for that important event to come to the hoped-for historic conclusions for the benefit of our people, I ask for the partnership and support of the international community and international and regional institutions, to which I would like to reiterate here once again our gratitude and our most sincere thanks for their unfailing support, especially when the Comoros almost sank into chaos 20 years ago. It is with their invaluable assistance that the country has returned to the path of peace and stability. The displacement of populations â?? in other words, migration â?? destabilizes both the countries of origin and the host countries. However, the Union of the Comoros refuses to allow the term â??immigrantsâ?? to be applied to Comorians who visit the Island of Mayotte, which is an integral part of its territory, despite the fact that it unfortunately remains under French administration. Indeed, the thousands of my compatriots who die each year in their attempts to go to Mayotte, a part of their territory, is not an immigration issue. The question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte relates to territorial integrity. Forty-two years after my country acceded to its international sovereignty, and in the absence of a solution to the issue since 1975, that question continues not only to weaken stability but also to hinder the countryâ??s socioeconomic development. I therefore welcome the continuation of the dialogue between my country and France in the quest for a just and equitable solution to the dispute over the Comorian Island of Mayotte, consistent with international law and respectful of the interests of each party. I pray to Allah the Almighty that He will keep us alive so that next year from this same rostrum I will be able to share with the Assembly the positive and consensual results of that dialogue. France is a permanent member of the Security Council. Its history links it to freedom, democracy, justice, respect for international law and the promotion of peace. It does not intend to divide or separate a people. Its interest, like ours, lies in a world of stability and a peaceful and prosperous Indian Ocean region looking towards a better future. In the Near East and the Middle East, the international community must mobilize further to end the martyrdom of the thousands of children crushed under bombs, the hunger imposed on populations, the use of chemical weapons, the chaos and the partition processes in countries at war. The international community must sanction the use of chemical weapons. We must act to ensure that hope is restored for the displaced and refugees and that the countries affected can recover their stability and territorial integrity. With regard to the Middle East, the lack of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current status quo are fuelling insecurity and destabilization in the region. The solution to that conflict lies in stopping the unacceptable colonization of the Palestinian territories, the end of injustice and violence against the Palestinian populations and the global settlement of the conflict, which is more than a half century old, on the basis of the two-State solution, which will fulfil the Palestinian peopleâ??s right to full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Beyond solidarity speeches, support for causes, the condemnation of attacks on friendly countries and peoples, the expressions of compassion for victims, and the calls for respect for the right of peoples, the sovereignty of States and the integrity of their territories, we must show greater commitment. In any case, the Union of the Comoros believes in the United Nations and its capacity to face todayâ??s challenges. We believe that such an Organization is possible. We believe that we are able to build such a United Nations together. Before concluding my remarks, allow me to take the opportunity of the coming of the Islamic New Year 1439 to convey to the General Assembly my greetings and best wishes for peace, progress and prosperity.",1,196
7740,Session 72 - 2017,CPV_72_2017.txt,CPV_72_2017,72,2017,CPV,"I am very pleased and honoured to be taking part in this meeting of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I bring with me the warm greetings of the Cabo Verdean people both living in the country and in the diaspora. I want to assure Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres of the full support of the Government of Cabo Verde, especially in carrying out the reforms he has announced aimed at strengthening the broad delivery capacity, transparency and accountability of our Organization. I salute the President of the Assembly at its seventy- second session, Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, and wish him every success. We listened with particular interest to the programme he has announced for his presidency, whose six points are interlinked and geared to ensuring peopleâ??s protection, dignity and well-being. Indeed, the theme proposed for the seventy-second session could not be more appropriate, given the underlying objective of the Presidentâ??s programme to bring the United Nations ever closer to the people. Cabo Verde prides itself on being a nation with five and a half centuries of history, and on having built a creole identity of its own at the junction between Africa and Europe, while also being open to the world, with a significant diaspora in several countries and embodying the peaceful coexistence we wish to see in all nations. As a small island country that has few natural resources and no mineral resources at all, we know that we can only affirm ourselves in the concert of nations and in the global economic system by exemplifying political, institutional and social stability; by displaying cosmopolitanism, being trustworthy in our relations with development partners and investors; by upholding the values of democracy, freedom, human dignity and full citizenship; and by proving the quality of our institutions and the excellence of our human resources. Although intangible, they are our greatest assets and the foundation of our development process. Our only option is to value those assets and to make them distinctive and focused on the people who are truly our development actors and beneficiaries â?? the children, young people, women and men of all countries. I raise these points because I agree that it is appropriate to focus on people. Women and men in every country need political, institutional, socioeconomic and educational environments that release their creative energy and their capacity to innovate and learn, to work, cooperate and trust, to self-organize and to be accountable. That is possible only in environments of peace and security that establish a belief in the future in people, as opposed to simply living one day at a time, beset with unease and limited horizons. The people and the Government of Cabo Verde are concerned about the current international context, where not only do old disputes persist but where we are also seeing new internal political crises, armed conflicts, terrorist acts and the organized crimes of trafficking in drugs, people and weapons and piracy, as well as other transnational ideological trends, such as populism, racial supremacy, xenophobia and intolerance of human and cultural diversity. Such ills are detrimental to global peace, because they cause human suffering, claim lives and contribute to other humanitarian tragedies, such as the unprecedented increase we are seeing in the numbers of refugees, as well as in hunger and violence against women and children. They undermine the rule of law, weaken democracy, threaten the territorial integrity of States, corrupt the bases of economic and social progress and endanger coexistence at both the national and international levels. These evils, unfortunately, spare no region in a globalized world. Just as the threats to security are global, so are the challenges. The opportunities for combat ing them effectively are also global, and permanent representation for Africa on the Security Council is therefore fully justified. The Government of Cabo Verde supports reform of the Security Council aimed at enabling it to reflect todayâ??s changing world by integrating permanent representation for Africa into its broader composition. In our view, considering that the positions of both sides have already been sufficiently expressed, it is time to start negotiations based on a text. Thanks to the United Nations, for the first time humankind has a holistic and comprehensive agenda that offers a real opportunity for sustainable and inclusive development, not only because it integrates the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, but also because it considers the cross-cutting issues of peace, security, justice and necessary partnerships and promotes the call to leave no one behind. Now, two years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the challenges lie in its implementation. The United Nations must therefore be able to play a catalytic role in forming consensus and mobilizing resources to make a difference on the implementation, funding and capacity-building fronts. In that regard, we commend the Secretary-Generalâ??s ongoing exercise aimed at adapting the United Nations development system and reforming the Secretariatâ??s management structures to meet the challenges of implementing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. In that regard, we should focus particularly on the situation of middle-income countries, including small island developing States that have graduated to that status, such as Cabo Verde. This category of countries needs a common response in terms of new metrics that can provide a more systemic assessment of their financial needs and structural vulnerabilities. For small island developing States, the swift and rapid implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate change is a priority, as it should be for the whole world. Cabo Verde expresses its solidarity with the victims of recent hurricanes. While there have always been hurricanes, the bad news is that with climate change they tend to be more frequent, cruel and destructive. The consequences are devastating for the regions and countries that are most vulnerable from an environmental and economic point of view, such as small island developing States and their regions. Every new day is one day too late for vigorous and globalized action on the factors that trigger and accelerate climate change. For Cabo Verde, the rule of law and democracy are not mere options; above all, they are essential to ensuring objective, transparent and predictable governance, both nationally and internationally. Cabo Verdeâ??s internal order is aligned with international positions and practices in the field of human rights through the Constitution of the Republic and its laws, institutions, public policies and social practices. We recognize, however, that there have been difficulties within the United Nations in harmonizing positions regarding the universalization of human rights principles and practices, and that we must pursue that objective through dialogue and respect among parties. In that regard, I would like to highlight the Secretary-Generalâ??s initiative to establish a pact with Member States and a circle of leadership on preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse in all United Nations operations, above all in the context of peacekeeping and humanitarian action. That initiative will give greater dignity to our worldâ??s most vulnerable people, especially women and girls, and promote their rights. As a supporter of international relations governed by international law, Cabo Verde actively participates in codifying such law by joining and taking part in negotiations and by signing, ratifying and implementing most of the international instruments in a broad spectrum of areas. In that context, Cabo Verde has already deposited its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, concluded in New York on 7 July. We welcome the success of the preparatory work towards developing an international legal instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Moreover, we support the convening of a diplomatic conference in 2018 to work towards such a convention issue, which should have safeguards for the specific situation of small island developing States. The conclusion of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was a historic moment in the fight against impunity for those responsible for the most serious crimes against humanity, and I therefore express Cabo Verdeâ??s firm support to the ICC. Strengthening the Court is a duty that the present generation owes to future ones. As written by a poet and songwriter, and later sung by the diva CesÃ¡ria Ã?vora, Cabo Verde is â??ten little grains of sandâ?? in the middle of the Atlantic. Despite our small size, we want to make Cabo Verde a country with relevance in the Middle Atlantic in terms of economic stature, security and diplomacy for peace and the promotion of freedom and democracy. We intend to position Cabo Verde as a transit hub in the Middle Atlantic for tourism, air transport, port operations, financial and investment operations, business localization and development in the digital and nano-technological economy, and in the attraction of investment and skills from the diaspora. Cabo Verde promotes collective and cooperative security systems, as necessitated by the transnational nature of crime and its location. We are seeking to position ourselves as a useful interlocutor in the concert of nations for dialogue, peace and tolerance. Its history and location have transformed Cabo Verde into a country born of mergers between Europe and Africa, a country that maintains good relations with all nations of the world. We would like to value and develop those assets strategically. That is our vision and purpose for our economy, security and diplomacy. It is embodied in our strategic plan for sustainable development, which has already been completed and is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. Partnerships are an integral and indispensable part of the 2030 Agenda, and national ownership will find in them an unquestionable complement so that our strategic plan for sustainable development can succeed, with the United Nations at the forefront. Happiness is the ultimate right to which the people of the world aspire. The 2030 Agenda has given the world not only a vision but also a road map for bringing happiness to people and leaving no one behind on the path to sustainable development. In 1945, the peoples of the United Nations showed their determination to conduct humankind down a path that would not lead to war. Today, with the 2030 Agenda, they will be able to determine another course for humankind and for people who struggle with poverty and a lack of development alternatives. It is up to us â?? we, the peoples of the United Nations â?? to support both the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session in this honourable and great task of advancing the happiness agenda.",1,196
7741,Session 72 - 2017,CRI_72_2017.txt,CRI_72_2017,72,2017,CRI,"Costa Rica congratulates the President on his election and welcomes the priorities that he has established for his tenure. I would like to reiterate my countryâ??s commitment to working with him and all Member States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to help swiftly honour the pledges made in Paris and Marrakesh to mitigate climate change, to implement the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and to strengthen global governance and multilateralism as areas of supreme importance for the maintenance of international peace and stability. I also wish to convey a message of solidarity and sympathy to the people and the Government of Mexico for the human and material losses resulting from the earthquake that struck its capital and surrounding areas today. Every word, statement and action adopted in this Hall keeps alive Kantâ??s hope and inspiring confidence in humankind. To build a world based on the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, the 20-year review of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the treaties on the non-proliferation of weapons and the treaties on nuclear disarmament and prohibition is an acknowledgement of the multiple challenges that human communities face. They also evoke our sincere conviction in reaching globally agreed responses to the most urgent threats to humankind. Those milestones are recent pieces in the renowned understanding of those who, before us and in pressing circumstances, fought for dignified coexistence, for freedom as a life-long mandate and for keeping hope alive as a daily imperative. Our duty as leaders consists in leading our nations towards sustainable human development. Therein lies the ethical power of our actions, both in domestic affairs and in the Assembly â?? the importance of which calls for an active commitment to ensure the well-being of our nations and to fight against inequality, injustice and violence. It means inconveniencing those who are opposed to the world being a radiant, open and unbiased hearth for us all, rather than a free aspiration of resistance and misunderstanding. In the face of that wall of short-sightedness or malice, Costa Rica has always chosen honest work â?? the tireless ability to provide for one another with generosity, despite our small size. My country has chosen compassion, solidarity and peacebuilding as the main values in fully respecting human rights. In that framework, it has made international law, active multilateralism and the rejection of environmental destruction as the ideal mechanisms for resolving conflicts domestically and among States. That, in short, will always be our commitment to humankind. In September 2016, Costa Rica became the first country to enter into a national pact to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the concrete step of involving representatives at the highest levels in the country, local representatives and representatives from the business sector, churches, social organizations and academia â?? all of which have actively committed to seeking the implementation of those comprehensive goals. Through that initiative, we have aligned our 2015-2018 national development plan with the Sustainable Development Goals and the sectoral goals of national and local programmes and projects. Additionally, we established a functional strategy for the planning, implementation and monitoring of those goals â?? which operates on the basis of consultation, dialogue and accountability. Two years ago, I stated in this very Hall (see A/70/PV.19) that Costa Rica would commit to the design and implementation of the adequate instruments to wage a real and sustainable campaign against poverty. Given its multidimensional character, we adopted a multidimensional poverty index along with a multi-actor functional governance structure, which was one of the most important factors in the poverty reduction achieved for the first time in seven years in Costa Rica â?? through a coordinated and structured ownership in decision-making, initiative design and strategy implementation at a national level. In the same vein, Costa Rica and 42 other countries gathered here presented a voluntary national report on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals during the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development of the United Nations. Moreover, Costa Rica and the other States members of the Central American Integration System sponsored the harmonization of the regional Central America agenda with the same objectives. Costa Rica has understood and taken on the integrated universal and multidimensional nature of the SDGs. We therefore believe that its implementation requires policy and public management innovation. Leaving no one behind is a State and Government responsibility, but those entities cannot act alone. That is why the 2030 Agenda must be based on consensus, the creation of synergies and the creative participation and commitment of various actors and productive sectors â?? above all, in the commitment and call to action of the Assembly. Leaving no one behind is more than just a slogan, it is a forceful call to action for all the segments that make up our societies. That is why I commend the contents and the quality of the Secretary-Generalâ??s report for the repositioning of the United Nations development system so as to honour the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda. I believe that is the appropriate path to coordinate and carry out comprehensive actions that respond to the current and future needs of sustainable development. In that regard, we must consider the needs of middle-income countries. I believe it is advisable to continue the efforts carried out thus far and to continue to promote the interests of middle-income countries, with a view to the United Nations offering them more efficient, targeted and better coordinated support. Costa Rica wishes to stress the importnace of countries and the United Nations system reconsidering the concept of per capita income as the gauge for determining a countryâ??s progress. Only a multidimensional view of development, especially a multidimensional view of poverty, will allow us to understand the needs of the people and families and the individuals that make it up, as it relates to access to health care, the elimination of inequality, promoting gender equality and attention to social, economic and environmental weakness, among other challenges of developing nations. With due respect but also with urgency, I call on the Secretary-General to promote open spaces to establish work strategies that would strengthen the capacities of such countries and allow them to cooperate more effectively with other middle-income countries and with less-developed countries. For those countries, reaching the Sustainable Development Goals will be impossible unless economic, social and environmental problems are incorporated into a path of comprehensive action. As a universal forum, the United Nations has a privileged position for consolidating the consultation process of middle-income countries. Amartya Sen has said with incontrovertible authority that to speak of the development of a particular society, we must analyse the lives of those who live within it, and that there can be no economic success without considering the quality of life of communities, which is one and the same with that of each of its members. That thesis gives special attention to minority groups that have been historically excluded from fully exercising their rights and denied the understanding of the societies in which they live â?? especially if their nature requires the adoption of targeted processes in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda. That complexity requires taking a closer look at productive sectors, such as family agriculture â?? the primary source of income for 70 per cent of the global rural population, that is, 40 per cent of the global population. Close to 500 million small farms provide 80 per cent of the food consumed by the developing world. In many cases, they are the historical basis for the productive development of entire nations, as is the case in my country. Family agriculture has a crucial role to play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as it integrates the goals and is the basis for the sustainable production of food, for the environmental management of rural and marine territory and for biodiversity â?? as a source of significant cultural expressions of each people. It is, without a doubt, a fundamental pillar of the integrated development of nations. In that regard, alongside a group of countries from different parts of the world, Costa Rica will be honoured to present a draft resolution at the current session to declare the decade of family agriculture 2019- 2028 â?? inspired by the success of the International Year of Family Agriculture, adopted by the Assembly in 2014 as resolution 66/222. Gender equality continues to be a goal of quintessential importance in all nations. Every day, more women strive to be fully recognized and to exercise their rights. Their struggle is inherent in the building of truly democratic societies and of peaceful coexistence in all countries. Moreover, without equal rights for women, it will be impossible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by the target date set by the Organization. The literature is vast and the political declarations are forceful in highlighting the noticeable democratic gaps and the resulting detriment to development due to the persistence of patriarchal and chauvinist structures forged in another time but revived today absent education regarding human rights and respect for democratic coexistence. Gender inequality is not a topic that is foreign to us, nor a phenomenon that unfolds covertly in the internal relations of countries beyond our purview, but rather it is occurring in front of our very eyes. Let us take a moment to look around us. It is imperative to take joint action to ensure that equality in this important organ. My country has understood that commitment and welcomes work proposals from International Gender Champions that seek to revert the trend of gender inequality within the United Nations and to take concrete actions for the seventy-second session by calling on the Gender Champions to promote equilibrium within each delegation that attends the general debate during the Assemblyâ??s week of high- level debate. Womenâ??s effective participation in the economic sectors of their societies has a deep and significant impact on other areas of independence, as an economically empowered woman is a person with the tools and capabilities necessary to make a positive impact on her community and her family. While it is true that many women work, are entrepreneurs, are employed in the public and private sectors and are scientists and artists, millions of others work in the informal sector or do domestic work and unpaid care. It is estimated that womenâ??s unpaid work is equivalent to $10 billion per year, or 13 per cent of the global gross domestic product. However, if I were to choose a single insulting and absurd example of this discrimination, the one that angers me the most is that the average womanâ??s salary is 25 per cent lower the average manâ??s salary for the same job. I had the honour to co-chair the High-level Panel on Womenâ??s Economic Empowerment, along with Ms. Simona Scarpaleggia, Chief Executive Officer of IKEA Switzerland, at the request of former Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and UN-Women. The final report of the Panel, in which women from the entire world participated, concluded, â??that it is essential to expand social protection coverage and access to justice with due process; that care is also an economic activity whose contribution should be reflected in countriesâ?? productivity; that men should share responsibility for fulfilling this work and private companies and public institutions are called on to encourage it; that women have the challenge of accessing digital and financial services, as well as of being deed owners in land redistribution; that companies must recognize womenâ??s leadership; that it is urgent that Statesâ?? macroeconomic policies empower women and promote decent jobs for them; that laws that discriminate must be amended and others that encourage equality must be enacted; that affirmative policies on hiring women must be extended to public institutions and private companies and women-owned businesses must be promoted; and that it is necessary to reinforce support to informal women workers and women agricultural workersâ??. Of course, we must adopt a multidimensional and intersectoral strategy to address the barriers to womenâ??s economic empowerment. In that regard, Costa Rica has in place a public policy that guarantees womenâ??s employability on an equal basis. The main objective of this policy is to eliminate womenâ??s lack of access to, and permanence in, the workplace. The private sector is the key actor in that, as it is the main source of employment and national development. This practice is part of the new trend in international markets and the global economy, where companies seek to increase their productivity through innovation, the improvement of the work environment, the attraction of talent and the adoption of values and practices based on human rights. Nevertheless, we recognize that multiple challenges remain to making progress towards substantive equality for women. We are determined to incorporate women in paid work, with measures that eradicate gender-based division in the workplace and facilitate economic independence and quality of life as necessary conditions for the full enjoyment of human rights. With the Assemblyâ??s permission, for just a moment, I would like to convey this message in English to all the women who, with their work, raise up their families and local and national communities. Today I extend my recognition to all women on Earth. They are capable enough to move ahead despite the rigid and rude patriarchal heritage that tends to not acknowledge their abilities and accomplishments and that fills with doubts and dangers their road towards full autonomy. They are an example for others: their internal strength leads them to break the chains of oppression, rise above the misery of migration and forced displacement and free entire communities from various forms of slavery. And in the grim march of their lives, they devote themselves with great passion to their people; they are sensitive and protective even when their love and generosity are not understood or repaid. 22/27 17-29275 They are masters of resilience, since they have learned how to deal with bad people and painful moments. They know how to fulfil their roles of mother, partner, friend or leader, and they dedicate themselves to them even if they need to sacrifice themselves because of a superior responsibility, a greater good that they accomplish with sincere devotion, aware of the risks and bearing in mind that they are an example to other women that follow in their steps. Definitely, it is not easy being a Khaleesi. Whether in fiction or in real life, the goal of equality is much greater than what our circumstances relegate us to. Today is a good day to look at ourselves in the mirror, start to create truly equal relations and bring this long night to an end. My generationâ??s grandparents could not have foreseen the consequences that industrialization and business models would have on the climate. We, the grandparents of future generations, can. That is why we cannot be indifferent. It is true that for decades humankind has had the resources and scientific knowledge to precisely measure the behaviour of endless variables related to the environment and that it can project future scenarios for weather conditions in different parts of the world and the impact they would have on humans and their social, productive and cultural activities. These capabilities commit us at levels seldom encountered throughout the history of humankind. They saddle us with an ethical and moral responsibility about the future of life on Earth and the terms of the interactions among human groups and between humans and their environment. There is enough evidence to support the idea that a transformative solution to climate change is within human capabilities. That is why we welcome the French initiative of a global pact for the environment, which would complement the legal framework of the international agreements adopted by the United Nations in 1966. We are also pleased to be a member of the group of friends, which under the leadership of Slovenia, Switzerland, Morocco and Maldives, promotes the draft resolution on human rights and the environment that is being coordinated in the Human Rights Council. Also, along with countries of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, we have exercised a positive leadership position in the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, building bridges between negotiating groups and making proposals. Our countries must adopt increasingly ambitious positions on environmental conservation and in the fight against climate change and understand the right to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment as an essential right of every human being and of future generations. The international community can count on the unconditional and unrestricted support of the Costa Rican people and Government in promoting this vital agenda. It is my pleasure to inform the plenary that, with the shared leadership of Chile and Costa Rica, Latin America is moving towards establishing a regional instrument on the rights of access to information, participation and justice on environmental matters. The initiative aims to produce more effective agreements in the context of socio-environmental conflicts through an environmental governance programme in which the State acts as a facilitator in agreement and decision-making spaces with the participation of all interested and affected stakeholders. It includes the principles of precaution, reparation and non-regression. We reaffirm our intention to guide our economy towards carbon neutrality, as part of the pre-2020 voluntary actions, and we are expanding our long-term commitments towards the in-depth decarbonization of the economy. Our electrical grid continues to be an example of planning and renewable energy use for the world, thanks to long periods of energy generation based solely on renewable sources â?? in water, wind, geothermal sources, biomass and sunlight. In addition to the offsetting process of our forests, we are reducing emissions in critical sectors, such as transport, livestock and waste. We have set an absolute emission limit for 2030 that is equivalent to a 25 per cent decrease in emissions as compared with 2012. That places us in a privileged position to become a green centre for management, innovation and knowledge transfer. We invite our strategic partners to join this effort. It is clear that we cannot not improve the health of our oceans if we do not change our land production and consumption. In that regard, our recently issued national wastewater sanitation policy and our national strategy for plastics replacement seek to stop pollution resulting from land-based activities and reverse their cumulative effects. To that end, straws, coffee stirrers and plastic containers are to be replaced. In addition, we are working to end destructive fishing practices and to coordinate efforts so that coastal populations can develop from the use and sustainable management of marine-coastal resources. Along the same conservation lines, we presented our national wetlands policy, which seeks to ecologically rehabilitate the Costa Rican wetland ecosystems and to promote actions for their sustainable and participatory use, as well as the establishment of a framework planned over the long term in order to restore the national wetland systems and ensure its responsible use in order to contribute to improving the quality of life of the communities that use it. We believe that all those efforts not only encourage a focus on and the mitigation of climate change, but they also have an impact on human rights and public policies that promote gender equality, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of the rights of indigenous peoples. That is why we also welcome the process to prepare the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees. In that regard, I would like to recall the principle of the progressivity of human rights â?? an essential principle that implies expanding the range of rights granted, from which we cannot go back. But above all, it entails the idea that we are called on to provide our inhabitants with increasingly more and better guarantees that allow the free and full exercise of each of those rights. The twentieth century witnessed some of the greatest and most atrocious conflicts that humankind has experienced. The end of the Second World War marked an even greater threat, one with the potential to destroy our species. The nuclear arms race was, for much of the second half of the last century, a constant concern that threatened the continuance of the human family. Costa Rica views with great concern the events developing on the Korean peninsula. The increase in the warmongering rhetoric on that part of the Asian continent implies a serious and real threat to the peace and stability not only of the region, but of the world. Costa Rica is amazed by how, almost three decades after the end of the Cold War, ghosts that we thought had been banished forever reappeared in a world where there is need for more medicine, not rifles, more schools, not barracks, and more projects to provide drinkable water than facilities to produce weapons of mass destruction. That is why we strongly and vehemently condemn the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We will always support dialogue, active diplomacy and multilateralism. We call on the parties involved and on the Security Council to take an active role in avoiding escalations of tension that could lead to dire consequences and from which there is a risk of no return. We cannot remain silent or stand idly by. Therefore, together with the Secretary-General, we demand that the Security Council act immediately, as is its responsibility, to contain this situation. We view with hope, joy and pride the fact that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was finally approved in July of this year. I congratulate Costa Rican Ambassador Elayne Whyte on that process. As President of the United Nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination, she led the process with courage and great skill. That effort, together with that of the participating delegations, made a dream come true after more than seven decades. The Treaty is a strong message that most States Members of the United Nations do not support, do not accept and do not consider nuclear weapons as legitimate, and that the international community clearly states that nuclear weapons are not only immoral, ethically repugnant, but are, henceforth, illegal. A new norm of international law that absolutely prohibits nuclear weapons in all circumstances is therefore established and provides a solid and legally binding framework for the destruction and total elimination of nuclear weapons in a transparent, irreversible and verifiable manner within specified time frames. As an unarmed democracy that bases its defence entirely on international law, we are satisfied that, in addition to prohibiting the development, production, manufacture, transfer, possession, storage, location, installation and deployment of nuclear weapons, the Treaty explicitly prohibits the threat of its use, thereby also banning so-called nuclear deterrence security doctrines. Many will say that this entire effort is meaningless, since none of the nuclear Powers wanted to be part of it. With respect, I tell them they are wrong. The desire of the 122 countries that approved the text of the Treaty is the legitimate voice of peoples who love peace and defend humankind. Any effort to support disarmament will never be pointless. Supporting peace will never be a mistake. Costa Rica applauds those 122 countries and all those that will sign the Treaty tomorrow, and urgently calls on others to join in signing it, so that we can ensure a future for us and for those who will come after us so that we can continue to build the world we are dreaming of. Costa Rica is constantly shocked by the terrorist attacks that unfortunately happen everywhere in the world almost every week of the year. Once again, we want to express our absolute and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, no matter who commits it, wherever it is committed or whatever its purpose, and we stress the need to bring its perpetrators to justice. The fight against terrorism must be framed in strict observance of international law, including human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law. I wish to emphasize the crucial role of international law as a legitimate mechanism for settling disputes among States, which we must resolve. In that regard, considering that unilateral economic sanctions are not efficient ways to punish Governments but can seriously harm the rights of peoples to well-being and development, I once again would like to express the opposition of my country to the embargo that the United States has imposed against Cuba for 55 years, with high human, economic and social costs for its population. Sixty-nine years ago Costa Rica decided to exchange weapons and soldiers for notebooks and teachers. Sixty-nine years ago Costa Rica decided to establish, strengthen and promote international law as the civilized way to resolve its differences with others. Today, 69 years later, Costa Rica continues to believe that. The original goal of the creation of the United Nations was to save future generations from the scourge of war. The world has changed in a dizzying way since 1945. The threats and challenges to peace, stability and global security are increasingly diverse and complex. However, there is something that has not changed one iota: the intrinsic and natural impulse to strive untiringly towards the most dignified and highest universal values based on law and towards the prevalence of institutions over brute force, of multilateralism over smaller, narrower and pettier national interests. That is the essence of this institution: to achieve the well-being of all nations as a whole by sustaining peace in each of them. It is not the opposite. It is not to achieve the well-being of each nation in order to achieve global well- being, but rather it is in the worldâ??s interest to uphold the interests and well-being of our individual nations. The Andalusian poet Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca said that theatre is the poetry that rises from the page and becomes human, and becoming human, speaks and yells, cries and despairs. It is our duty now to take action based on our rhetoric and to go out into the world and make it all possible. We must restore hope to the hearts of the worldâ??s citizens and ensure that that hope leads to a life of dignity that enables them to fully enjoy their rights and freedoms. The fight to uphold human rights is historic and long-standing endeavour. Never before have the levels of education and peace been so high and the number of conflicts so low. That does not mean that we should reduce our mobilization efforts and become complacent. It means that, in spite of it all and although war and structural violence still plague many regions of the world, human society remains on the right path, in no small measure due to the Organizationâ??s efforts. We own our future. In spite of the pain caused by injustice and perpetual and pervasive irrational behaviour, there are more people who believe that happiness, solidarity, freedom, justice, peace, forgiveness and reconciliation are possible â?? many more than those who promote death, pain, torture and militarization and spread fear, which all thwart our beautiful creative capacity. This will be the last time that I address the Assembly as President of Costa Rica. Next year, as my country fulfils a decades-old civic duty yet again, my people will send a new representative to address an Organization of which we are so proud. That will happen repeatedly in future because a democracyâ??s presidential mandate calls for the perpetual renewal of its leadership. I have been pondering this moment for several months. On behalf of all representatives and their children, I would like to dedicate these closing words to my sons and daughters. Future generations also deserve to be acknowledged in this universal forum because, in many ways, they are the beneficiaries of the solutions their parents brought to the table, both metaphorically and in the deepest human sense. I would like MÃ³nica, Cristina, Beatriz, Diego, Ignacio and little InÃ©s to know that each time a father or mother steps up to this rostrum to promote peace and justice, reconciliation and solidarity, it is with them and their present and future in mind. I would like them to know that each time a father or mother takes the floor to promote human rights, gender equality and the importance of protecting the environment from the irrational forces of human greed or consumerism, they do it out of deep concern for their well-being and that of future generations. I would like them to also know that their father, and before him other Costa Rican mothers and fathers who stood before the Assembly, did so proud to represent a people who are full of dignity, hard working and courageous. They clamour for peace and seek to build it day by day. They will always uphold human rights as our universal familyâ??s highest good. That should make them proud and happy. They should be proud to be part of an ongoing story that, like the waves of the ocean will happen time and again, just as the world continues to have hopes and dreams for human progress. They should be happy because they know that our efforts to promote justice and peace have not been and will not be in vain. I hope that the United Nations will continue to be the preferred forum for fostering understanding among the peoples of the world. It will not be a conflict-free environment because, unfortunately, that is not our speciesâ?? default state, but it could be a meeting point where people can reach agreement, based on the higher aspirations of human progress that makes survival possible. I also hope that this session can shed light on demilitarization and denuclearization, which are the only ways to ensure our survival, beyond all efforts to guarantee it. I also sincerely hope, with all my heart and soul, that all nations represented here today are happy, at peace and able to adhere to the wise biblical admonition to beat swords into ploughshares. It is simply another way of saying love your neighbour as you love yourself.",1,196
7742,Session 72 - 2017,CUB_72_2017.txt,CUB_72_2017,72,2017,CUB,"Allow me to reiterate to the Secretary-General Cubaâ??s support for his work at the helm of the United Nations and as a guarantor and advocate of international peace. I would like to express my deep condolences to the relatives of the deceased and the victims of hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as our readiness to increase our cooperation, to the extent of our modest possibilities, with the brother peoples and the Governments of Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, which are small Caribbean islands that suffered terrible devastation, along with the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, the Virgin Islands and Anguilla. I call upon the international community to give the highest priority to the situation and to mobilize resources to assist the small Caribbean island States and territories that have suffered such devastation. We would like to convey Cubaâ??s warmest feelings of solidarity to the people and the Government of Mexico, particularly the victims and their relatives who were affected by earthquakes, and we reiterate our readiness to assist their people and support their recovery efforts with our modest efforts. We also want to express our sorrow to the people of the United States, as well as our heartfelt condolences to the relatives of the deceased and to all victims of Hurricane Irma. I speak on behalf of the people of Cuba, who are currently carrying out a colossal effort to recover from the severe damage caused to housing, agriculture, the power system and other services by Hurricane Irma. Despite the all-encompassing preventive measures â?? including the evacuation of more than 1.7 million people â?? and the full cooperation of all citizens, we suffered the loss of 10 people. The grave damage to services, the loss of social and personal goods, and the hardships endured by families that spent many hours without electricity and/or water only strengthened the unity and solidarity of our noble and heroic people. The moving scenes of rescuers saving a girl and returning her to her mother, a little boy picking up a bust of JosÃ© MartÃ­ from the rubble, students helping families they had never met before, soldiers from the Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior doing the toughest jobs, and local leaders heading the most difficult tasks have become all too familiar. During a visit to the area that suffered the most severe devastation, President RaÃºl Castro issued an appeal that read: â??These have been difficult days for our people, who, in just a few hours, have seen how what was built with great effort could be destroyed by a devastating hurricane. The images received during the past few hours are powerful, as is the spirit of resilience and victory of our people, who come back fighting in the face of every adversity.â?? On behalf of the Government and the people of Cuba, l sincerely appreciate the genuine expressions of solidarity and affection expressed by numerous Governments, parliaments, international organizations and representatives of civil society. I would like to convey my profound gratitude for the numerous offers of assistance that we have received. I still have vivid and emotional memories of the imposing presence of Fidel Castro Ruz, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, and the great validity of the ideas he expressed to the General Assembly. On behalf of our people and Government, I would like to express our gratitude for the expressions of respect, affection and admiration that we have received from so many. Last Tuesday, President Donald Trump came here to convince us that he proposes to promote the prosperity of nations and persons. But in the real world the wealth possessed by eight men together is equivalent to the wealth shared by the 3.6 billion human beings who make up the poorest half of humanity. In terms of turnover, 69 of the 100 biggest entities in the world are transnational companies, not States. The turnover of the worldâ??s 10 biggest corporations is higher than the public revenues earned by 180 countries combined. Seven hundred million people live in extreme poverty, and 21 million are victims of forced labour. In 2015, 5.9 million children died of preventable or curable diseases before reaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are still illiterate. Eight hundred and fifteen million people suffer from chronic hunger â?? tens of millions more than in 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the precarious decreasing growth rate of recent years rebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face hunger by the year 2030. Given current trends, we will not be able to eradicate hunger by the year 2050. There are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian tragedies associated with migrant flows are worsening and increasing amid the clearly unjust current international economic and political order. The construction of walls and barriers, as well as the laws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of refugees and migrants, have proved to be cruel and ineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and xenophobic policies that violate the human rights of millions of people and fail to solve the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts â?? the main causes of migration and refugee claims. Military expenditures have increased to $1.7 trillion. That reality contradicts those who claim that there are not enough resources to eradicate poverty. Despite all the rhetoric, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development lacks the means for its implementation, owing to the egoism and lack of political will of the United States and other industrialized countries. What is the miraculous solution that President Donald Trump recommends to us in the absence of the financial flows of the Marshall Plan? Who will contribute the resources for that? How can that be reconciled with the â??America Firstâ?? idea advanced by President Reagan decades ago and by Trump today? The President of the United States ignores and distorts history and believes that a chimera is a goal to be pursued. The production and consumption patterns of capitalism are unsustainable and irrational and will inexorably lead to the destruction of the environment and the end of the human species. Can anyone forget about the consequences of colonialism, slavery, neocolonialism and imperialism? Could the several decades of bloody military dictatorships in Latin America be referred to as an example of successful capitalism? Does anyone know of any form of neoliberal capitalism that has benefited 17-29716 5/28 us all, as opposed to that which destroyed the Latin American economies in the 1980s? It is urgent and essential for the United Nations to work to establish a new participatory, democratic, equitable and inclusive international economic order, as well as a new financial architecture. They must take into account the needs and particularities of developing countries and the asymmetries that exist in world trade and finance as a result of centuries of exploitation and plundering. Industrialized countries have the moral obligation, the historical responsibility and sufficient financial and technological means to do that. However, not even the rich will be able to enjoy the forecast prosperity if climate change is not stopped. Cuba regrets the decision taken by the Government of the United States, which has historically been the principal greenhouse-gas-emitting country on the planet, to withdraw that country from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In 2016, and for the third consecutive year, the records for the average global temperature increase have been broken, which confirms that climate change is a threat to the survival of humankind and the sustainable development of our peoples. We reiterate our solidarity with the small island developing States, especially those in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which are the most affected by climate change and for whom we request just, special and differentiated treatment. We also support the priority attention accorded to the needs of sub-Saharan Africa. The United States Government has come here to tell us that, in addition to prosperity, the other two â??beautiful pillarsâ?? of the international order are sovereignty and security. We all share the common responsibility of preserving the existence of human beings in the face of nuclear weapons. An important contribution to the achievement of that goal was the historic adoption and signing, under the auspices of the Assembly, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which bans the existence, use and threat of use of such weapons, which have the capacity to annihilate the human species. The United States has strongly opposed that treaty. It announced that it will invest $700 billion in military expenditures, and it is developing an extremely aggressive nuclear and military doctrine, based on the threat of the use of force and the use of force. NATO member States have violated international peace and security and international law by promoting military interventions and unconventional wars against sovereign States. As the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, pointed out: â??When this philosophy of despoilment disappears, the philosophy of war will have disappearedâ?? (A/PV.872, para. 188). The unlawful imposition of unilateral coercive measures and the use of financial, judicial, cultural and communication tools to destabilize Governments and deny peoples their right to self-determination have become commonplace. I believe that the militarization and the covert use of information and communication technologies to attack other States have increased, while several developed countries strongly oppose the adoption of international treaties that would regulate cooperation aimed at securing a safe cyberspace. The President of the United States manipulates the concepts of sovereignty and security to his exclusive benefit and to the detriment of all others, including his allies. The attempt to resort to military threat and force in order to stop the irreversible global trend towards multipolarization and polycentrism will seriously jeopardize international peace and security, which should be defended and preserved through international efforts. The principles of sovereign equality, respect for the territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should be respected. The Charter of the United Nations and international law do not allow for reinterpretation. United Nations reform should pursue the principal goal of responding to the pressing needs of people and the great disadvantaged majority. Multilateralism should be protected and reinforced so as to resist the imperial interests of domination and hegemony. The democratization of the Security Council, both in terms of its composition and its working methods, is a most urgent task. It is also essential to strengthen the General Assembly and recover the functions that have been usurped. Patriotism, which was invoked in the statement of the United States, is a perversion of humanism and of love and loyalty to the homeland and the enrichment and defence of national and universal culture. It embodies an exceptionalist and supremacist vision of ignorant intolerance in the face of diverse political, economic, social and cultural models. In developed countries, the loss of the legitimacy of political systems and parties has worsened, and voter abstention is on the rise. Legal and illegal corruption is spreading. There is the extreme case of the so-called special interests, or corporate payments, in exchange for benefits, in the country that spends the highest amount of money in electoral campaigns and where, paradoxically, a candidate with the lowest number of popular votes can be elected or be entitled to govern with the negligible support of voters. There has been an increasing and unheard-of use of science and technology to exercise hegemony, mutilate national cultures and manipulate human behaviour, as in the case of so-called big data, or psychometry, used for political and advertising purposes. Seven Western consortiums keep strict control over what is being read, seen or heard on the planet. Technologies are being monopolized. The governance of digital networks is dictatorial and discriminatory, and despite appearances the digital divide between rich and poor countries is increasing. Opportunities and the rights of youth, migrants and workers are being curtailed, and their human rights are being openly and systematically violated. The day before yesterday, the United States Vice-President, Michael Pence, ridiculously ignorant of the functions of the Security Council and attempting to establish new prerogatives, said that the Security Council should modify the composition and methods of the Human Rights Council, which â??does not deserve its nameâ?? because â??a clear majority of the Human Rights Councilâ??s members fail to meet even the most basic human rights standardsâ??. I assume that Mr. Pence is not including his own country in that category, which in fact deserves to be included because of its pattern of the systematic violations of human rights, such as the use of torture, arbitrary detentions and imprisonment, as occurs in the Guantanamo naval base, the assassination of African Americans by law-enforcement agents, the killing of innocent civilians by its troops, xenophobia and repression against immigrants, including minors, and its limited compliance with international instruments. We reaffirm our strongest condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism, and we reject the application of double standards in combating them. The urgent quest for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East is based on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the existence of a free and independent State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The situation in the Western Sahara requires an effort, in accordance with United Nations resolutions, to ensure the Saharan peopleâ??s ability to exercise self- determination and to ensure respect for their legitimate right to live in peace in their own territory. Cuba reaffirms its support for the quest for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the war in Syria, without any foreign interference and with full respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Threats to international peace and security stemming from the expansion of NATOâ??s presence along the borders of Russia are on the rise. We continue to reject the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed against that country. We demand respect for the so-called nuclear agreement signed with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We reject the threat to totally destroy the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, home to 25 million human beings. War is not an option on the Korean peninsula; it would threaten the existence of hundreds of millions of people in that area and in neighbouring countries, and it would lead to a nuclear conflagration of unpredictable consequences. Only through dialogue and negotiations will it be possible to achieve a lasting political solution, which should take into account the legitimate concerns of all parties involved. We support the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, without foreign interference, with full respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of the States concerned and strict adherence to the principle of the non-use or threat of use of force. Today, new threats are looming over peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean, in open disrespect for the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed in Havana by the Heads of State and Government of our region in January 2014 at the Second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. We reiterate the statement made on 14 July by President RaÃºl Modesto Castro Ruz concerning the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela: â??The aggression and putschist violence against Venezuela harms all of â??Our Americaâ?? and only serves the interests of those set on dividing us in order to exercise their control over our peoples, unconcerned about causing conflicts of incalculable consequence in our region, such as those we are seeing in various parts of the world. â??Today, we have warned that those attempting to overthrow the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution through unconstitutional, violent and putschist methods will shoulder a serious responsibility in the eyes of history.â?? We strongly reject the military threats against Venezuela, including the United States executive order that designates Venezuela a threat to the national security of the United States, and the unilateral, unjust and arbitrary sanctions applied against it. We reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the Bolivarian and Chavista people and Government, and with its civic-military union led by Constitutional President NicolÃ¡s Maduro Moros. We denounce and condemn the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act initiative promoted in the United States Congress as part of an interventionist approach intended to impose an economic embargo against the people and the Government of Nicaragua, to whom we reiterate our support. We express our solidarity with former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, victim of political persecution intended to prevent him, by means of judicial disqualification, from running for direct elections. Lula, President Dilma Rousseff, the Workersâ?? Party and the Brazilian people will always find Cuba on their side. We reaffirm our historic commitment to the free determination and independence of the people of Puerto Rico. We support the legitimate claim of Argentina for sovereignty over the Malvinas and the South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands. Cuba will continue to contribute to the extent possible, and at the request of the parties involved, to efforts to achieve a stable and lasting peace in Colombia. We will uphold our commitment to share our modest achievements with the peoples of the South, including the efforts of the 40,000 aid workers deployed in 64 countries, who are fighting today for the life and health of human beings. On 16 June, the President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, announced the new Cuba policy of his Administration, which represents a setback in bilateral relations and undermines the basis established two years ago for a move towards a new type of relationship between our two countries that was characterized by respect and equality. The United States Government has decided to tighten the economic, commercial and financial embargo by imposing new obstacles to the already limited possibilities that the United States business community has to trade with and invest in Cuba as well as additional restrictions on United States citizens wishing to travel to our country. Those decisions have ignored the support on the part of broad sectors in the United States, including the majority of Cuban Ã©migrÃ©s, for the lifting of the blockade and the normalization of relations. They only serve the interests of a group of individuals of Cuban origin based in south Florida, which is an increasingly isolated minority group that insists on harming Cuba and its people for having decided to defend, at all costs, its right to be free, independent and sovereign. Today, we reiterate our condemnation of the measures aimed at tightening the blockade and reaffirm that any strategy intended to destroy the Cuban Revolution will fail. Likewise, we reject the manipulation of the human rights issue against Cuba, which has much to be proud of and has no need for lessons from the United States or from anyone else. We wish to express our strongest condemnation of the disrespectful, offensive and interventionist statement against Cuba and the Cuban Government made three days ago from this rostrum by President Donald Trump. We remind him that the United States, where flagrant human rights violations raising deep concerns in the international community are being committed, does not have the slightest moral authority to judge my country. We reaffirm that Cuba will never accept any preconditions or impositions, nor will it ever renounce any of its principles. With regard to the alleged incidents that have allegedly affected United States diplomatic officials in Havana, we categorically affirm that the Cuban Government rigorously and seriously abides by its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure the protection and integrity of all diplomats without exception, including those of the United States, and that Cuba has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate actions of that sort, nor has it allowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by third parties for such purposes. Based on the preliminary results of the investigation, carried out with priority and with a high technical component, following instructions issued from the highest level of our Government, the Cuban authorities, having taken into account data provided by United States authorities, have not found any evidence whatsoever that could confirm the cause or the origin of the health disorders referred by United States diplomats and their families. The investigation seeking to clarify that issue is ongoing, and in order to be able to reach a conclusion, it will be crucial to able to count on the cooperation of the United States authorities. It would be unfortunate if a matter of that nature were to become politicized. As has been expressed by Cuban President RaÃºl Castro Ruz, Cuba is willing to continue negotiating all pending bilateral issues with the United States, on the basis of equality and absolute respect for the sovereignty and independence of our country. We will maintain a respectful dialogue and cooperation in areas of common interest with the United States Government. Cuba and the United States can cooperate and coexist, respecting our differences and promoting everything that benefits both countries and peoples, but no one should expect Cuba to make concessions that affect its sovereignty and independence. The Cuban people will not cease their demand for the lifting and total elimination of the economic, commercial and financial blockade and will continue to denounce the strengthening of that policy. On November 1, Cuba will once again present to the General Assembly the annual draft resolution entitled â??Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cubaâ??. While inequality â?? the opulence of a few and the marginalization of many â?? is growing in todayâ??s world, the Cuban people will keep up its struggle to achieve the most just society possible. We will continue to steadily advance down the path of revolutionary transformation that has been sovereignly chosen by all Cubans to further improve our socialism.",1,196
7743,Session 72 - 2017,CYP_72_2017.txt,CYP_72_2017,72,2017,CYP,"At the outset, I would like to convey my Governmentâ??s congratulations to Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and assure him of our unwavering support for his mandate. At the same time, I would like to once again congratulate Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres on his assumption of his duties since 1 January. The Government of Cyprus and I personally have full faith and confidence in his abilities and vision. To that end, we stand ready to provide all necessary assistance towards achieving our shared goal of promoting the values and principles of the United Nations at a time marked by great uncertainty and instability. Like the years preceding it, 2017 has been marked by turbulence. To name only a few examples, terrorism, regional conflicts, forced migration, the alarming effects of climate change and humanitarian crises are realities that have placed an enormous strain on our peoples and the environment. Human nature drives us to work for what is in our best interests and those of future generations â?? the preservation of our planet, peaceful settlements of conflicts, an end to terrorism and extremism, action to prevent natural disasters, and joint efforts to alleviate the immeasurable human suffering experienced around the world. There is only one way to achieve that, and it is multilateralism. We stand here as world leaders to pledge our determination and commitment to a better world, through cooperation and joint actions. It is only through collective efforts that we can address crises like the current one with North Korea, which threatens the resilience of our global non-proliferation and disarmament regimes, as well as the peace and security architecture of the region and beyond. International multilateral cooperation is also vital in dealing with the scourge of terrorism. Terrorist attacks have unfortunately become commonplace in our world, from Baghdad to Kabul, from Paris to Cairo, from Barcelona to London. They target our cities and citizens with cowardly acts of asymmetric aggression. Along with adopting enhanced security measures, it is essential to prevent and counter radicalization and violent extremism within our societies through education, dialogue, economic growth and social inclusion. There is no security without development, and there is no development without security. Enhancing our societiesâ?? resilience is a key aspect of our multilateral endeavours, and in that respect our determination to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development must remain high on the list of priorities. Sustainable development is at the heart of dealing with the root causes of forced migration, which for the past two years has dominated the global agenda, and not without cause. The crisis is putting pressure on our societies as well as our Governments, while at the same time it is changing the way political dialogue is conducted. However overwhelming the situation may be, we must not lose sight of the big picture, which is the need for solidarity and burden-sharing. All these issues, along with the additional challenges that we are facing, point in one direction. We need a just, effective and efficient global governance system. In that regard, we are here to renew our commitment to a global order based on international law, with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations at its core â?? a global order that ensures that peace, security, human rights and sustainable development remain the highest values that we subscribe to, preserve and uphold. Cyprus believes that the reform priorities that the Secretary-General has laid out are essential to ensuring thatmultilateralism remains relevant and effective in a time of growing scepticism and isolationist tendencies. The three pillars of reform, in distinct yet parallel and complementary processes, will, if successful, provide us with a changed narrative pertaining to the ability to prevent crises before they erupt, reinforcing and enhancing peacekeeping and peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance and long-term development and growth. The theme of this yearâ??s session of the General Assembly â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is extremely relevant to my country, which is still suffering from the scourge of war and its ongoing violent division. In that regard, we firmly believe that the most vital element in achieving inter-State, regional and global peace is respecting and ensuring the full and unhindered independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every State Member of the United Nations â?? a pillar that constitutes one of the most indispensable provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the most basic rule aimed at prohibiting foreign intervention in the territory, the exclusive economic zone or the internal affairs of independent and sovereign States Members of the United Nations. It is only by adhering to that standard that we can avoid inter-State conflicts and bloody internal clashes, which in turn establish the conditions for prolonged destabilization, violence and uncertainty. One country that unfortunately continues to endure the consequences of blatant violations of fundamental principles of the United Nations is mine, the Republic of Cyprus, which since the 1974 military invasion of Turkey has remained under its occupation. The pretext for the invasion was the restoration of constitutional order following the attempted coup dâ??Ã©tat against the President of the Republic by the Greek military junta. I have deliberately used the word â??pretextâ?? since, instead of restoring the constitutional order, Turkey ended up occupying 37 per cent of the territory of Cyprus, while forcibly displacing more than a third of the Greek Cypriot community from their ancestral homeland. Thousands were murdered, and more than 1,000 Greek Cypriots have been missing since 1974. By the same use of force, all our Turkish Cypriot compatriots were compelled by Turkey to relocate from the areas controlled by the Government of Cyprus, in which they had been residing peacefully, to the areas occupied by Turkey. In the same context, through the continuous presence of more than 40,000 Turkish troops and thousands of transplanted settlers, in a conscious effort to alter the demographic character of the island, Turkey established an illegal entity under its absolute political, economic, cultural and religious control and dominance. It is not my intention to engage in a game of blame. On the contrary, I truly wish that I were in the position to inform the Assembly that my vision of reaching a settlement â?? one that I have repeatedly described from this rostrum â?? has become a reality. Unfortunately, despite our constructive approach, our tireless and unwavering efforts and the progress achieved, the most recent rounds of talks, which were launched in May 2015 and began to crescendo in July 2017 at Crans- Montana, have reached a deadlock, which is attributable exclusively to Turkeyâ??s intransigent position, as reflected in its proposals aimed at reducing Cyprus to a Turkish protectorate instead of being positively predisposed to establishing a truly independent, sovereign and conventional State. One might consider my previous comments to be exaggerated were I not able to substantiate them, as I intend to do now. In 1960, with the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, among others, under the Treaty of Guarantee, Turkey, Great Britain and Greece set out to guarantee the independence, territorial integrity and security of Cyprus. In that regard, I should stress that Turkeyâ??s exploitation of that provision has regrettably led to the pain and suffering that the people of Cyprus â?? Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike â?? have endured and continue to endure as a consequence of the unacceptable status quo. It is for that exact reason that, since resuming negotiations on establishing a normal and sovereign State and from the very beginning, we have made it our goal to terminate the Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as agree to a sunset clause for full withdrawal of the foreign occupation troops. That is a principled position that the Secretary-General himself holds as an indispensable element in efforts to reach a settlement. As he said on 4 June, â??Progress in this chapter [that is, the chapter pertaining to security and guarantees] is an essential element in reaching an overall agreement and in building trust between the two communities in relation to their future securityâ??. Based on both the observed progress in the bicommunal dialogue and the Secretary-Generalâ??s assessment, which I just cited, on 28 June the multilateral Conference on Cyprus opened with great expectations. Following negotiations in an effort to positively support the whole process, the Secretary-General presented an outline of six fundamental thematic topics comprising, on the one hand, the chapter on security and guarantees, including the withdrawal of foreign troops, and, on the other hand, issues related to the internal aspects of the Cyprus problem. Reaching the points of convergence within the Secretary-Generalâ??s framework would have led to a strategic agreement, thereby injecting a new dynamic and impetus into the process of realizing the valid hope that an overall settlement might be feasible. In full compliance with the Secretary-Generalâ??s outline, I submitted credible and realistic proposals that effectively addressed the sensitivities and concerns of both communities, and that, like the Secretary- Generalâ??s framework, were based on the capacity of the Republic of Cyprus as a State member of the European Union (EU) and the United Nations. In stark contrast to the framework of the Secretary-General and the positions of the other two guarantor Powers, Turkey, in adopting an inflexible position, insisted on maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as the permanent presence of troops. In his statement before the General Assembly at its current session, the President of Turkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip ErdoÄ?an, claimed that the unsuccessful outcome of negotiations at Crans-Montana was attributable to the incomprehensible position of the Greek Cypriot side. In response, I would like to say that I am sorry but I have to reply by asking the Turkish President the following questions. Is it incomprehensible to aspire to establish an independent and sovereign State without foreign guarantees and the intervention of a third country, while enjoying freedom from the presence of occupation troops? Is it irrational to advocate establishing a normal State in which all decisions are made only by its citizens, free from foreign dependencies? Is it unreasonable for an EU member State to efficiently and effectively participate in the decision-making of the European Union? Is it unfounded to envision terminating the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and establishing a robust security system based on the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant treaties of the European Union and the Council of Europe? Is it against any established principle for the United Nations, as well as the relevant institutions of the EU, to ensure and safeguard the smooth and secure implementation of the provisions of the settlement? And is it a paradox to reject Turkeyâ??s insistence that it should assume that role? Does any constitution of a federal State provide that, for every decision at the federal level, at least one positive vote by the members of the State is required, especially when one of the members of the federation is controlled by a third party? Finally, could anyone maintain that reaching a settlement based on Turkeyâ??s proposals would have led to establishing a functional and viable State? Despite our disappointment, what I want to emphatically stress and convey is that the vision of the people of Cyprus is simply to end the unacceptable status quo and establish a federal State that would ensure all generations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots conditions of stability for a safe, prosperous and peaceful future; a State free from any foreign interventions and dependencies; a â??normal Stateâ??, as the Secretary-General has very correctly stated; a State led by Cypriots for Cypriots. In that regard, and contrary to the statements made by Turkish officials, it is my intention, at tomorrowâ??s meeting with the Secretary- General, to convey our readiness to immediately resume negotiations in accordance with his framework and in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Within this context, it is widely acknowledged that if a new conference on Cyprus is to convene, and in order to avoid a repetition of the shortcomings of the past, there should be thorough and solid preparations and strong political will and determination on the part of all interested parties and stakeholders so as to ensure that this time deliberations will lead to a positive outcome. For that, I have no doubt that the Secretary- General and the permanent members of the Security Council will offer us their support and help. At the same time, at this critical juncture we need an alternative to unilateral actions that have a negative effect on the aim of moving the process forward. Mutually agreed confidence-building measures that are in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions and reports of the Secretary-General, such as the return and resettlement of Varosha to its rightful and lawful inhabitants, would be game-changers in creating a climate conducive to resuming negotiations with the aim of reaching a comprehensive settlement. That aim would be further reinforced through progress on the humanitarian issue of missing persons. To that end, I call on Turkey to fully cooperate in order to resolve this tragic issue. I also take this opportunity to urge all countries that may hold information to open their archives in order to support our efforts to bring an end to this tragic aspect of the Cyprus problem. In conclusion, I once again urge Turkey and our Turkish Cypriot compatriots to realize that it is only through mutual respect and compromises, not obsolete fixations on failed practices, that we will achieve a viable and lasting settlement that has neither winners nor losers and fully respects and addresses the sensitivities and concerns of both communities. That is the only way for Cyprus to fully utilize its potential and exploit its unique geographical position. That is my vision.",1,196
7744,Session 72 - 2017,CZE_72_2017.txt,CZE_72_2017,72,2017,CZE,"When I was a relatively young man, I was deeply influenced by two books. One of them was The End of History and the Last Man, by Francis Fukuyama, and the second was The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, by Samuel Huntington. Fukuyamaâ??s book was a description of a brave new world, a new utopia where every country has the same political system based on a liberal parliamentary democracy â?? a nice dream, but nothing more. As for Huntington, he was realistic and cynical. He simply predicted the gradual emergence of conflicts among various types of civilizations. By the way, in one of his articles in Foreign Affairs, he also speaks about the bloody borders of Islam. So, now we have a new type of civilization â?? I should call it anti-civilization â?? which has emerged over the past two or three decades. The typical feature of that civilization is the fact that it is based on terror and nothing more. We see those terrorist actions all over Europe and beyond. We convey our condolences, we express our solidarity with the victims of terrorist actions, we organize protests and demonstrations, but unfortunately we still hesitate to fight against that terrorist anti-civilization with our full power. I must admit that one year ago, I criticized the United Nations here (see A/71/PV.12) for its inability to define the word â??terrorismâ??. The situation has changed. For 70 years, we have not been able to define the word â??terrorismâ??. On the other hand, I highly appreciate the action of the Secretary- General and the recent creation of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, which is a reasonable step towards a practical solution to the fight against world terrorism. The Assembly must know that there are 38 â?? I repeat, 38 â?? anti-terrorist organizations and institutions under the umbrella of the United Nations. Thirty-eight â?? good heavens! I believe that the more such institutions we create, the more terrorist movements are able to flourish. What we need is a single, strong office to fight terrorism, equipped with all the necessary measures, including military force, to fight terrorism and based on Article 47 of the Charter of the United Nations. I appreciate the nomination of Mr. Voronkov, whom I met yesterday. I am sure he will be able to solve the problems contributing to worldwide Islamic terrorism. Let me address the other side of the coin â?? migration. Migration is partly provoked by terrorist actions, as seen in Syria and Iraq. On the other hand, migration is also connected with terrorism because some jihadists pose as migrants. In Europe and elsewhere, they create sleeper cells, encourage lone wolves and so on. I understand those who say that we must welcome migrants, but my opposition arises from the fact that massive migration from African and other countries represents a brain drain. The young, healthy people â?? mainly male â?? who leave their countries represent a weakening of the potential of those countries. Everybody who welcomes migrants in Europe agrees that the brain drain exists and that it contributes to the continuing backwardness of those countries. What we need to do is help such countries by providing electricity, hospitals, schools and water resources in order to stabilize the domestic population, but not to support migration. In conclusion, I wish to say that the war against terrorism must be based on historical optimism and the belief that we shall overcome someday. In Barcelona, Spanish people said that they were not afraid, and Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed the need to live free from fear. That is why I should like to quote a sentence from Martin Luther that I believe most beautifully expresses historical optimism: â??If I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple treeâ??.",1,196
7745,Session 72 - 2017,DEU_72_2017.txt,DEU_72_2017,72,2017,DEU,"We seem to be going through a phase in which we are confronted with hurricanes and earthquakes, both political and natural, upheavals that are getting harsher and more intransigent and belligerent from day to day and from speech to speech. As responsible politicians, it is vital that we ask ourselves how we can bring about a change in direction that will lead to more peace and stability, less hunger and better prospects for everyone in the world. How do we ensure that globalization will ultimately deliver justice for all rather than riches to the few? One answer as to how we can achieve that change in direction can be found in a report addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It states that we must not limit ourselves to the â??traditional questions of peace and warâ?? but must also work to overcome â??world hunger, mass misery and alarming disparities between the living conditions of rich and poorâ??. I find the analysis very apt. The painful thing about that excerpt is that it comes not from a recent report to the Secretary-General but from one that goes back nearly 40 years. Its apt analysis of the global situation can be found in North-South: A Program for Survival, commissioned almost 40 years ago to the day, the report of the North-South Commission, which began its work in 1977. The Chairman of the Commission was former German Chancellor Willy Brandt. Humankind is still dealing with more or less the same structural difficulties today, but it seems to have become rather more difficult to change the world for the better. Looking around the globe today, it seems that a world view that puts oneâ??s own national interests first and which refuses to engage in a balancing of interests among the nations of the world is gaining ever more ground. National egotism, I believe, is worthless as an organizing principle for our world of the twenty-first century. Such egotism sees the world as an arena, a battleground in which everyone is fighting against everyone else and in which everyone has to assert his or her own interests, either alone or in alliances of convenience. In this world view, it is the law of the strongest that prevails, not the strength of international law. I firmly believe that we have to rise up against this world view. We need more international cooperation and less national egotism, not the other way around. Some 40 years ago, the North-South Commission recognized that global problems cannot be resolved through confrontation but only through often arduous efforts to compromise and identify common interests. Ultimately, no country can win if it strives only to assert its own interests. If we all did that, looking out only for our own national interests, confrontations and conflicts would increase and global prosperity would falter. The motto â??Our country firstâ?? would not only lead to more national confrontations and less prosperity; in the end, we would all be the losers. As Germans, our historical experience is quite unusual. Only after two terrible world wars did we learn to see our former enemies as neighbours and partners with whom we wanted to share and shoulder responsibility for a peaceful coexistence. Only since then have our own citizens in Germany had a better life. We have learned that it was not â??Germany firstâ?? that made our country strong and prosperous; rather, it was â??European and international responsibility firstâ?? that gave us Germans peace and prosperity. In international cooperation, no one loses sovereignty. Rather, we all gain a new sovereignty together that we cannot possess as nation States on our own in todayâ??s world. That is why the European Union today provides the framework for our German policies. The road has often been rocky and arduous, for nothing is more difficult than turning former enemies into friends. Often the way is not popular, and one needs considerable political courage to take it. Indeed, the call for international cooperation and for efforts to balance interests is not always popular in our own countries. However, that courage finally led to peace and prosperity in Europe after centuries of war. Today we Germans are grateful to the courageous people in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and many other countries of Europe for having the courage to befriend us â?? their former enemies â?? as new and lasting partners after the Second World War. It is precisely because of that experience in Germany and Europe that we support the work of strong, functioning collective institutions, above all the United Nations. The urgent need for us to work together to establish a safer world has been vividly demonstrated by North Koreaâ??s current irresponsible actions, which pose a serious threat to world peace. We must send a clear message that the international community will not accept its nuclear provocations. Germany welcomes the sanctions adopted by the Security Council and calls for their speedy implementation in Europe, and we also support European initiatives calling for additional measures. At the same time, we should use all the diplomatic means at our disposal, first to defuse the situation and then to find a starting point for long-term solutions. Resolving this international crisis is crucial because if we do not, others will be encouraged to emulate North Korea. If a country can build up a nuclear arsenal while the international community stands helplessly by, other political leaders and countries will follow its example. That would bring about new nuclear crises emerging all over the world, and our children and grandchildren would grow up in a very dangerous world. That is why North Koreaâ??s acquisition of nuclear weapons is neither a bilateral nor a regional problem, but rather a global challenge that we have to overcome together. We cannot accept the possibility that efforts to build a nuclear arsenal can be rewarded on the international stage. It is therefore more important than ever that the international architecture for arms control and disarmament does not crumble. Existing treaties and agreements must not be called into question. That applies in particular to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for Iranâ??s nuclear programme. The Plan is a way out of the impasse of a nuclear confrontation that would jeopardize security in the region and have an impact far beyond it. However, we can reach the level of confidence that we so urgently need only if all obligations are rigorously met and the transparency we have agreed on is established. Germany will work within the E3+3 framework to ensure that the JCPOA is strictly implemented and upheld. That is not just about Iran; it is about the credibility of the entire international community. For what State would renounce the development of its own nuclear programme if it were shown that negotiated agreements did not last and that a binding agreement with the international community was not worth the paper it was written on? How can we convince countries such as North Korea that international agreements make them more secure and will therefore encourage them to commit to further disarmament efforts if the agreement with Iran, the sole international example of such an endeavour, is not upheld? What the world needs most urgently now is renewed trust. With particular regard to the implementation of the ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have a request for the United States, Russia, China and every country possessing nuclear weapons. They will be instrumental to ensuring the implementation of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of arms control and disarmament. To that end, trust among them must be restored. Statements by Presidents of the United States are always important and interesting, and always worth listening to and even reading after they have been delivered. I found a passage in one such statement that I especially liked. In it, the President of the United States of America called for general and complete disarmament. Every year, he said, billions of dollars were spent on weapons that were acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them. That, he went on to say, was clearly not the most efficient means of ensuring peace. I have to admit that the statement dates back even further than the report of the North-South Commission. It was delivered by John F. Kennedy in 1963. We can see that everything that we need for a safer future has already been considered, written and said. I believe that today we should focus on the bold visions of the North-South Commission and President Kennedy, and have the courage to come up with new proposals for disarmament, arms control and confidence-building. One of our tasks is to resolve emerging crises early on. A recent example is the escalating violence against the Rohingya people and the resulting refugee flows in the region. We should act as quickly as possible on the issue to offer both political and humanitarian support for alleviating the suffering and ending the conflict. Germany will again increase its aid to the Rohingya through the International Red Cross. We are committed to providing political and humanitarian support, as well as to practical peacebuilding, in many crisis regions around the world. And while military engagement under United Nations auspices is also sometimes necessary, we must ensure that we do not create any imbalances in that regard. To bring up the North-South Commission again, its report included the impressive finding that, at the time it appeared, a half-day of the worldâ??s military expenditure would have sufficed to finance the entire malaria eradication programme. I suspect that today we would not even need that much. The worldâ??s current annual spending on weapons is just under $1.7 trillion. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 1 and thereby eradicate extreme poverty in the world by 2030, we would need only 10 per cent of that. Sustainable Development Goal 4, on education, would require even less per year. With that in mind, Germany has tripled its funding for civilian peacebuilding measures in the past few years. Thankfully, progress has been made in some areas, for example in Iraq. We must work fast to consolidate the successes achieved there in combating the so- called Islamic State by initiating reconstruction and stabilization measures in the cities and regions that have been liberated. Germany has therefore decided to make an additional â?¬250 million available for the reconstruction of Mosul. We cannot abandon the victims of the thugs of the Islamic State. We must help them return to their country. It is also important to strengthen a democratic and inclusive Iraqi State and ensure that the actions of an individual region do not leave it exposed to a relapse into destabilization or civil war. We can only ask the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq not to trigger any new conflicts, which are the very last thing that the country needs. We also have to make progress in the Ukraine conflict. The Minsk agreements, which Germany played a key role in drafting, provide a clear road map for peace, based on the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the inviolability of borders. If proposals are now put forward for deploying a United Nations peacekeeping mission involving Blue Helmets, I think we should pursue that idea resolutely. While there is certainly not yet sufficient consensus on what such a mission should look like, the idea is worth testing if it can help achieve a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the conflict zone. We would like to ask the Secretary-General to press for the proposal to be realized. The North-South Commission pointed out that focusing solely on questions of war and peace was not enough. Those issues are also inextricably linked to the fair distribution of resources and to economic and social development and respect for universal human rights. Only a world in which solidarity prevails will ultimately bring us security and stability. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development shows that the international community sees that as a common interest. If we want to make a reality of major ambitions such as peace, security and justice, we need stronger joint international institutions, and especially a stronger United Nations. The founders of the United Nations were not naive. They had experienced the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century. For that very reason, they bequeathed to us the Charter of the United Nations, with its timeless principles and maxims. But while the principles of the United Nations are not outdated, the Organization has to adapt to the challenges of our times. We therefore support the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts to push ahead with bold reforms within the United Nations. He is setting the right priorities. The success of United Nations reform is largely up to us, the Member States. We have to work together to ensure that the United Nations is more efficient and has greater clout. In my view, reform efforts should not focus primarily on budget cuts. On the contrary, the United Nations will need more resources if it is to fulfil its mandate. We must therefore provide it with the means it needs to be successful. However, at present the figures tell a different story. The World Food Programme currently receives less than 50 per cent of the funding it needs to combat hunger crises around the world. Today a mere 15 per cent of contributions to the United Nations Development Programme are voluntary, non-tied payments, although in 2011 they were still at 50 per cent. The same is true for other United Nations aid programmes, and sometimes the outlook is even bleaker. It should not be the job of those in positions of responsibility at the United Nations to spend more time sending begging letters seeking the necessary funding than in organizing effective assistance. We must change course and grant the United Nations more freedom with resources in exchange for greater transparency in its use of funds. Germany at any rate intends to maintain its financial support for the United Nations. As the country that is the fourth-largest provider of assessed contributions to the United Nations and that goes far beyond that, being one of the biggest donors of global humanitarian assistance generally, our input is substantial. I believe that as Member States we should now take on another reform project that is long overdue. That is the composition of the Security Council, which should finally reflect the realities of the twenty-first-century world. Today many more States than at the time of the establishment of the United Nations, more than 70 years ago, are shouldering the responsibility for peace and security and are prepared to live up to that responsibility as Members of the Organization. Germany is ready and willing to take on additional responsibilities, which is why we are seeking a non-permanent seat on the Council for the 2019-2020 term. We have clear goals in mind. Peace and security, global justice and human rights are indivisibly linked. We are preparing for reform of the United Nations and its Security Council, and we intend to work in partnership with all countries of the United Nations in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, for we can resolve global problems only if we refrain from focusing solely on national interests and instead work to reach a fair and peaceful balance of interests among all nations. Yes, that is an arduous process. But we must muster the courage to go down that path. For as Willy Brandt, who headed the North-South Commission after he left office as Chancellor, once said, â??We firmly believe that problems created by men can also be solved by menâ??. Let us work on that together.",1,196
7746,Session 72 - 2017,DJI_72_2017.txt,DJI_72_2017,72,2017,DJI,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would like to take this opportunity to express the hope that under his leadership, the General Assembly will achieve its objectives and to assure him of my countryâ??s full support for his efforts. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Peter Thomson, who preceded Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k in his position, and to reiterate our warm congratulations to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres on his well-deserved appointment. We wish him every success as he discharges the lofty mandate that has been entrusted to him. Notwithstanding its major progress and new opportunities, the world continues to face many challenges. The economic and financial situation remains a source of concern, and the security front is equally worrying. New threats are emerging. The nature of conflict is changing. A number of crises are worsening and growing ever more complex. Even if climate change sometimes gives rise to scientific controversy, today it is an undeniable reality that is producing one major catastrophe after another. I would like to take this opportunity to convey our sympathy and solidarity with the communities that have been recently affected in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean. All of these challenges underscore the crucial importance of sustained and resolute collective action to address them. We must mobilize once more to revitalize multilateralism and stress the central role to be played in it the United Nations. The task is enormous and the responsibility heavy. Such challenges require ambitious reforms and increased resources. The reform undertaken by the Secretary-General in three key areas â?? the repositioning of the United Nations development system in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, management reform, and the reform of the peace and security architecture â?? is a timely response to the need to make the Organization a tool that can more effectively realize its full potential for serving the people it was created to serve. The 2030 Agenda is an ambitious programme both for the eradication of poverty and the preservation of the planet. In addition, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai Declaration and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda represent an array of tools for strengthening the 2030 Agenda. It also calls on countries to adopt policy frameworks in order to change their modes of production and consumption, as well as strategies to address climate change and disaster risk. With regard to the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Djibouti would like to make a few comments. First, Africa and the least developed countries should be treated as a priority. As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has pointed out in its analyses, â??[Africa is] the battleground where [the Sustainable Development Goals] will be won or lostâ??. We must also mobilize large amounts of financing if we are to match these ambitions. To do that, we must adopt innovative financing mechanisms that not only guarantee increased foreign direct investment but also ensure that development aid commitments are kept. The necessity of that can be demonstrated by careful study of the pledges for financing the Millennium Development Goals, which were not fully honoured, and by the fact that the goal of 0.7 per cent as a portion of gross national income established for official development assistance has not been regularly paid. If it had, by now we would have mobilized $2.5 trillion. We should also emphasize the importance of an international trade system focused on the three Ps, that is, poor-people-centred, productivity-enhancing and planet-friendly. Lastly, we cannot stress strongly enough the importance of evaluation tools that make it possible to reliably measure progress. Through strong partnership and sustained effort, we can and must work to promote economic growth that is mindful of social justice and respects the environment. The absence of peace is the major obstacle to economic development. The human cost of conflict is enormous and brings with it massive forced displacement, famine, the spread of communicable diseases, acute food insecurity and a rapid deterioration in respect for human rights. Now more than ever, our Organization has an increased role to play in conflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. In that regard, we welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s emphasis on such prevention and the reforms under way to restructure the peace and security architecture. The emergence of extremist terrorist groups perpetrating acts of unprecedented violence poses a new challenge. By disseminating an ideology of intolerance and hatred that calls explicitly for the annihilation of others, they undermine the cohesion of our societies and pose a threat to international peace and security that demands that we coordinate our efforts to combat terrorism. Djibouti welcomed the recent establishment of the Office of Counter-Terrorism for coordinating United Nations action in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. Djibouti also hosts the Centre of Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), designed as a common platform for supporting the strengthening of national and regional coordination, producing analysis and ultimately formulating an action plan aimed at countering extremist rhetoric conveyed through social media. I would now like to express our views on certain regional and international situations that are high on the agenda for States Members of the United Nations. Regarding Somalia, Djibouti welcomes the recent political developments in the country and the momentum created by the election in February of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo and the formation of a new Government. We welcome the many encouraging steps taken to strengthen relations with Somaliaâ??s federal member states and the strategy that has been implemented to promote tax and economic reforms aimed at mobilizing domestic resources. However, we stress the importance of increasing support to Somalia by mobilizing adequate funding in support of its development programme. We remain concerned about the proposed cuts in funding to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), despite the consensus on that African peacekeeping operationâ??s success. Care must be taken to ensure that the improvements in the security situation are maintained. AMISOM has brought the Al-Shabaab terrorists to their knees in a bloody defeat. With regard to South Sudan, we remain concerned by the slow implementation of the August 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. The actors involved in that protracted crisis must acknowledge that there can be no military solution to the conflict. In that regard, we support the decision of the thirty-first Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State and Government on the situation in South Sudan, and reiterate the need for a genuine, transparent and credibly inclusive national dialogue to enable lasting peace to be restored. We also underline the important role played by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan in the quest for a solution to the crisis there and urge all stakeholders to continue their efforts to implement their mandates, while recognizing the importance of complementary and coordinated action. Turning to Yemen, Djibouti continues to be extremely concerned by the triple tragedy the country is experiencing, as United Nations officials have emphasized in the Security Council â?? famine, an unprecedented cholera epidemic and a serious political impasse hindering progress towards peace and security. We urge all parties to return to the negotiating table. In Palestine, we all know that only a two-State solution can bring peace to the region. The suffering of the Palestinian people has lasted for too long and must end. Djibouti is also troubled by the fate of the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine state in Myanmar. We are gravely concerned about the military brutality targeting civilian populations and the atrocities that we have all seen in the press. Despite the Governmentâ??s assurances, the crimes against the Rohingya community have not abated. We support the conclusions of the final report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and call on Myanmar to fully implement its recommendations without further delay. Djibouti remains alarmed by North Koreaâ??s belligerent and dangerously provocative attitude. Its multiple ballistic-missile launch tests violate the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Member States should monitor the situation vigilantly. We call on North Korea to engage in a constructive and result-oriented dialogue to find a satisfactory solution to the crisis. Djibouti is still awaiting the return of the 13 members of its military who have been detained by Eritrea, a neighbour of ours whose belligerent policies towards my country continue. We call on Eritrea to accept the mediation efforts of the African Union in order to demarcate its Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island borders, begin to build trustworthy relationships with its neighbours and cease the hostile policies that are destabilizing the entire Horn of Africa. I wish the General Assembly every success in its work.",1,196
7747,Session 72 - 2017,DMA_72_2017.txt,DMA_72_2017,72,2017,DMA,"I come to the General Assembly straight from the front line of the war on climate change. With physical and emotional difficulty, I have left my bleeding nation to be in this Hall today because these are the moments for which the United Nations exists. It is why we have always collectively respected and held dear the values of this Organization. We congratulate the President on his election and wish him well in upholding the ideals of humankindâ??s greatest invention. In keeping with the Organizationâ??s regard for fraternity, we take this opportunity to express our condolences to our brothers and sisters in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Cuba, Saint Martin, Saint Thomas, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, as well as to those who have suffered losses in the host country, the United States, in Texas and Florida. For our brothers and sisters in Mexico, we stand in prayerful solidarity following the catastrophic earthquake this past week. Warmer air and sea temperatures have permanently altered the climate between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Heat is the fuel that takes ordinary storms that we could normally master in our sleep and supercharges them into a devastating force. In the past, we would prepare for a single heavy storm per year. Now thousands of storms form on a breeze in the mid-Atlantic and line up to pound us with maximum force and fury. Prior to this century, no other generation had seen more than one category 5 hurricane in its lifetime. This century, it has already happened twice and, notably, these two events occurred in the space of the last two weeks. I should add that we are only midway into this yearâ??s hurricane season. In the case of Dominica, it had been only two years since we lost lives and endured substantial physical and infrastructural damage from the ravages of the floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Erika. To deny climate change is to procrastinate while the Earth founders. It is to deny a truth that we have just lived. It is to mock the thousands of my compatriots who in a few hours will watch the night descend upon Dominica without a roof over their heads, in fear of sudden mudslides or whatever else the next hurricane might bring. We as a country and a region did not start this war against nature. We did not provoke it. But the war has come to us. There is no more time for conversation. There is little time left for action. While the big countries talk, the small island nations suffer. We need action and we need it now. We in the Caribbean do not produce greenhouse gases or sulphate aerosols. We do not pollute or overfish our oceans. We have made no contribution to global warming that can move the needle, yet we are among the main victims on the front line. We in the Commonwealth of Dominica have long pursued and respected an existence that preserves our little Eden. The Morne Trois Pitons has been a national park for 40 years and a UNESCO World Heritage Site for 20. Our livelihoods are part of our ecosystem. That is how my people and my country earn and survive. But what is our reality at this moment? It is pure devastation, as Dominicans bear the brunt of climate change. I repeat â?? we are shouldering the consequences of the actions of others, actions that endanger our very existence and all for the enrichment of a few elsewhere. We dug graves today in Dominica. We buried loved ones yesterday, and I am sure that when I return home tomorrow, we will discover additional fatalities as a consequence of this encounter. Our homes are flattened, our buildings roofless, our water pipes smashed and our road infrastructure destroyed. Our hospital is without power and schools have disappeared beneath the rubble. Our crops are uprooted. Where there was green, there is now only dust and dirt. The desolation is beyond imagination. The stars have fallen. Eden is broken. The nation of Dominica has come to the General Assembly to declare an international humanitarian emergency â?? one that is centred in Dominica but also encompasses many of our neighbours, including our sister isle, Antigua, which had to evacuate its citizens from Barbuda. Dominicans have been responsible members of the global community. We have joined all of the major international battles, from the abolition of forced labour to the protection of patents. Yet today 72,000 Dominicans stand on the front line in a war they did not choose, with extensive casualties from a war they did not start. The time has come for the international community to take a stand and decide whether it will be shoulder to shoulder with those suffering the ravages of climate change worldwide, whether we can mitigate the consequences of unprecedented increases in sea temperatures and levels, whether it will help us rebuild sustainable livelihoods or whether it will merely show some pity right now and afterwards flee, relieved to know that this time it happened to someone else. Today, we, the small nations of the world, need to know who our real friends are, the people who have our backs. Not all countries are sitting as inactive bystanders. Some of our traditional friends are playing their part. The United Arab Emirates, for example, has risen to the challenge. We commend Sheik Mohammed Al Maktoum, its Prime Minister, for his announcement, in this year of Zayed, that his country will boost the theme of giving by â??delivering even more goodness to all parts of the worldâ??. Today we invite nations of similar might to follow his lead. The success of the twenty-first session of Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris, was a demonstration of the collective political will of Member States in taking action to combat climate change. One year on, the call to action must be even more urgent if we are to curtail the impact of climate change on us and future generations. We need all humankind, all countries â?? big and small, developed and developing â?? to come together to save our planet. We must all live up to our obligations and commitments to do more. Inaction, and even inadequate action, destroys lives. The Green Climate Fund, which was created to help put mitigation measures in place and assist the victims of climate change, is commendable, but much more must be done to aid the countries that continue to bear the brunt of the impact of climate change. The World Bank established the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to assist countries that have been affected by natural disasters. Though helpful, the amounts are usually grossly inadequate to rebuild infrastructure and maintain the gains and progress made in economic and social development in the wake of the likes of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, or even in the case of a tropical storm such as Erika, which occurred two years ago. Substantially more funds must therefore be made available to vulnerable countries for loss and damage so they can mitigate the risks associated with future incidents. The World Bank Facility must be recapitalized for greater coverage by using already committed funds from the Green Climate Fund. That will enable our countries to focus on improving peopleâ??s lives and supporting the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. It will enable us to rebuild our nation â?? not as it was, but so that it is far more capable of meeting the realities of rising sea levels and warmer oceans. Not to do so would be to abandon those who have paid a steep price for what others elsewhere have created. It would be to let 72,000 Dominicans shoulder the worldâ??s conscience on climate change on their own. Today, we ask members not to express their sympathies this week and then hope that our eyes do not meet next week. Let these extraordinary events elicit extraordinary efforts to rebuild nations sustainably. Let them unleash the innovation and creativity of global citizens to spark a new paradigm of green economic development that stabilizes and reverses the consequences of human-induced global warming. Let it spark a thousand points of light, not shame. Let us take serious action against the realities of climate change. I promise that we Dominicans and other Caribbean citizens will play our part. We are in shock, but we are not bowed. We cry, but we do not despair. We will rise because Dominican people are strong, because Caribbean people are resilient. We will rebuild our Garden of Eden again for our children and for future generations. As a result of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015, we committed to creating a national vulnerability risk and resilience fund to improve our Governmentâ??s ability to respond to the impact of natural disasters. It has not yet been capitalized. We intended to transfer funds to it from our own treasury on an annual basis, but our capacity to earn has now been significantly compromised even before we have gotten it off the ground. Today we need all the things required after a natural disaster that has affected an entire nation. We need water, food and emergency shelter. We need roads, bridges and new infrastructure, but we also need delivery capabilities. I call on those with substantial military capacities to lend us the rescue and rebuilding equipment that may be standing idle, waiting for a war. Let Dominica today be that war, because our landscape currently resembles a war zone. The battle we are in has brought us to our knees. We need resources now so that we can move purposefully towards rebuilding our beautiful island home. We will need to rebuild homes and villages. We will need to rebuild communities, schools, roads and bridges. We will need to rebuild a country, and we cannot do it alone. Above all else, we need the international community. We need its humanity and we need it now to act truly as our United Nations.",1,196
7748,Session 72 - 2017,DNK_72_2017.txt,DNK_72_2017,72,2017,DNK,"This session of the General Assembly opens during a period of unprecedented change. Threats and challenges such as poverty, terrorism, climate change, violations of human rights, gender inequality, armed conflict, displacement and irregular migration are ever more interconnected. Our responses to those challenges must reflect their complexity. Our responses will require better and deeper cooperation, and must involve more stakeholders, new solutions and more effective international institutions. The evolving global landscape gives us an opportunity to renew and redefine how we work together. The United Nations must seize this opportunity. Denmark congratulates Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on the successful beginning of his term as Secretary- General. He can count on Denmarkâ??s full support in his efforts. More than ever, we need leadership and common purpose to steer the Organization in a new direction. Staying on the current path is not an option if we want to maintain the legitimacy of the United Nations. Fundamental and ambitious reform is the only way forward. This week, the Secretary-General laid out a strong vision for a reformed United Nations and a call for action to all â?? from Governments to the staff of this great Organization, to our partners outside this building. We must all invest in, and commit to, that agenda for change. As Member States, we have a responsibility to find common solutions that will turn our shared goals into positive change and protect the principles and values of the United Nations. That spirit must also guide our work in the years to come. Denmark is committed to international cooperation through the United Nations, built on shared values, the rule of law and human rights. That is one of the reasons that Denmark is running for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2019- 2021. Denmark has never before been a member of the Human Rights Council. As a longstanding supporter of the United Nations and a consistent advocate for the protection of the dignity and rights of all people, we believe that we could make a significant contribution in the Council, based on a commitment to promote dignity, dialogue and development. Denmark is committed to an ambitious follow- up to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, at home and abroad. We have provided at least 0.7 per cent of our gross national income in official development assistance for the past 40 years and will continue to do so in future. We call on all developed countries to meet the 0.7 per cent target. With only 13 years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we have no time to waste when it comes to fundamentally rethinking the United Nations Development System and its support for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Secretary- General has presented a set of clear reform proposals. Now we must come together and support their implementation. This is not a donor-versus-developing- country scenario, or a North-versus-South debate. Let us support the Secretary-Generalâ??s plan because we agree that we all have an interest in a United Nations that is cost-effective and can arrive at coherent and sustainable solutions on the ground. Citizens around the world expect nothing less. We need to break with the status quo, particularly in four priority areas. First, a reformed United Nations development system must deliver on the promise of unified country- level engagements where silo-thinking, competition for resources and fragmented support strategies become a thing of the past. Secondly, in our response to the many complex crises around the world, we need to build a stronger bridge between immediate relief and long-term development objectives. Our support for United Nations humanitarian work is as strong as ever. Denmark is one of the worldâ??s largest humanitarian donors, and in our 2018 aid budget we will allocate more funds to humanitarian action than ever before. We are fully behind the Secretary-Generalâ??s call for a new way of working in responding to protracted humanitarian crises and displacement. We must meet the needs of those affected, while also giving hope for a better future. The new way of working is about much stronger cooperation and coordination among partners in and outside the United Nations system, and Denmark will continue to play a leading role in advancing that agenda. Thirdly, the United Nations development system needs to be built on the basic premise that neither the United Nations nor Governments have the capacity or resources to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Partnering with the private sector, civil society, academia and innovators will be crucial. The United Nations must rethink how it incorporates those resources on our way towards meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Denmark is taking the lead to support strong and meaningful principle-based partnerships. Together with our strategic partners â?? Chile, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam â?? the Danish Government launched a new initiative this week in support of the 2030 Agenda, entitled Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030. The initiative brings together Governments, companies, cities, think tanks and investors to establish and boost public- private partnerships for a greener tomorrow. Through the initiative, we will leverage partnerships that will help us take better care of our planet. Fourthly, Denmark welcomes the Secretary- Generalâ??s strong commitment to gender equality in our reform efforts. Women and girls all over the world must be empowered to contribute to stronger communities and societies. Ensuring equal opportunities for women is absolutely crucial for reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. In the Danish Governmentâ??s view, gender equality is first and foremost a question of dignity and ensuring the human rights of all women and girls, including safeguarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. That is fundamentally about the right to decide over oneâ??s own body. As one of the founding members of the SheDecides movement, Denmark is committed to continuing to push for progress and protect the rights of all women and girls around the world. Just recently, Denmark announced a major increase in its contribution to the United Nations Population Fund. Too many young people today face a lack of opportunities and poverty. We have the largest youth population in history, and Denmark is committed to helping youth acquire the means and skills required to be drivers of development. If we want to ensure a more stable and peaceful future, Member States must adhere to international law and common rules for coexistence and cooperation. Regrettably, we continue to see Member States that put national interests before respect for the dignity and rights of their citizens, or ignore the legitimate concerns of their neighbours, as well as regional and global stability. The nuclear and missile tests conducted by the Government of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea constitute a blatant disregard of our collective security, non-proliferation norms and rules, and the continued demands by the Security Council. Denmark strongly condemns that irresponsible behaviour and calls on the regime in Pyongyang to de-escalate the current situation and commit to a peaceful solution in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. The recent outbreak of violence in Myanmarâ??s Rakhine state is deeply concerning. Denmark calls on the Government of Myanmar to facilitate humanitarian assistance to all those in need and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians fleeing from the conflict. We welcome the Governmentâ??s commitment to implement without delay the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The violence must stop, and the security forces must ensure the protection of civilians. We condemn the attacks on security forces and the subsequent serious human rights violations. We applaud the Government of Bangladesh for providing protection to civilians fleeing across the border. Denmark stands ready to assist both Myanmar and Bangladesh in pursuing integrated humanitarian and development solutions for the affected areas. Denmark stands in solidarity with all those affected by terrorism and violent extremism. We continue to be an active participant in combating those threats to our societies, including through our military and civilian contributions to the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh in Iraq and Syria. We are also a key partner in other conflict areas, such as Afghanistan, Mali, the Sahel and Somalia. To defeat terrorism, we need to supplement our military effort with broad-based engagements that also focus on cutting off terrorist financing and repelling extremist propaganda online and offline, as well as stabilizing areas liberated from Daâ??esh and building peace in conflict-affected countries. The United Nations plays a central role when it comes to stabilizing war-torn countries and building lasting peace, but comprehensive reforms are needed. Denmark welcomes the vision of the Secretary-General for the peace and security architecture of the United Nations with a streamlined, coordinated and effective response in the field. As Member States, we have an obligation with respect to, and a shared interest in, supporting those critical reforms so that the United Nations can fulfil its purpose and its promise to the world. The time for bold ambitions is now. If we do not support reforms and deny generationsâ?? hope and opportunity for a more prosperous future, we will continue to witness international turmoil and unprecedented levels of displacement. We will continue to witness people forced to leave their homes and venture out on dangerous journeys. And we will continue to witness many people falling into the hands of relentless smugglers and traffickers. Denmark contributes significantly to helping displaced populations and others in emergency situations live dignified lives. Last year, Denmark contributed more than $80 million to the Syrian crisis alone. Our programmes focus on helping refugees in their regions of origin, which enables us to use our funds more efficiently and ultimately help more people. Unmanaged migration poses a significant global challenge. We need to strengthen our cooperation and commitment to existing international legal frameworks. In that regard, Denmark welcomes the dialogue taking place in preparation for the global compact on migration. Through leadership and a renewed commitment to a reformed United Nations, innovation and willingness to challenge old ways of thinking, strong partnerships across the public-private spectrum, across age and gender divides and across different organizations and institutions, the opportunity to create a new path for our United Nations is here.",1,196
7749,Session 72 - 2017,DOM_72_2017.txt,DOM_72_2017,72,2017,DOM,"I am honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of the people and the Government of the Dominican Republic. At the outset, I would like to apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina SÃ¡nchez, President of the Dominican Republic, for his absence from the debate, as he has had to return to our country to deal with Hurricane Maria. Our meeting this week coincides with the devastating season of natural disasters that our region has been enduring for nearly a month with terrible consequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, which has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, and the southern United States, viciously punished by Hurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering caused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and Barbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, 90 per cent of whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its Prime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irmaâ??s devastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving a new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct hit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto Rico, causing great destruction and damage. We take this opportunity to express our solidarity with Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as well as with all the countries affected. The people of the Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy for the destruction and the large numbers of victims. Accurate figures for the damage done on Saint BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, have yet to be determined. However, we can say that they have suffered substantial damage, that recovery will take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have been lost. To give Member States an idea of how severely we have been affected, despite the lack of definitive figures, I can say that the material losses caused by this hurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic product of the Dominican Republic. We often focus on material damage and ignore the human suffering caused by such disasters, whose lethal power has been aggravated by climate change. The statistics are striking, but they cannot reflect the pain of the victims, their desolation at seeing so much work ruined and so many efforts, visions and dreams lost. It is not just houses that have been lost, it is homes. Material damage has been done, but above all, lives have been shattered. We must recognize the inherent dangers of climate change, which are far more significant in the context of the geography of the Caribbean. Our economies, our way of life and our potential for development are in jeopardy. The vulnerability of the Caribbean and of the Dominican Republic poses a risk that we cannot face alone. While our country was fortunate enough not to suffer human losses during the recent passage of Hurricane Irma, we are aware that, like every Caribbean island, we will always be vulnerable to this type of phenomenon. That reality impels us to once again draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to the crucial importance of joining forces to confront such threats. It compels us to act in a responsible and united way to defend the lives of our people. And I would like to be extremely clear on this point. The messages of solidarity and the humanitarian aid that always follow such disasters are not enough. Nor is it enough to sign agreements on climate change. There is an urgent and critical need to act coherently on those agreements in order to advance a united agenda and set concrete plans in motion. We are facing a growing problem that knows no borders and requires the cooperation and solidarity of all of us, but especially the most developed and most powerful countries. We are facing a reality that will oblige us to act as responsibly as we can if we do not want to go on lamenting the consequences. That is why my country is once again proposing to the Assembly that we create a special fund for dealing with this type of disaster and for prevention and early warning, which will help us save lives. If we want to see an example of how economic resources can help to mitigate the damage done by natural phenomena, we need only look at the United States. After the most recent hurricanes, its Government, which has the necessary resources, immediately made $15 billion available for rebuilding its affected states, thereby providing its citizens with the help they needed. Conversely, there is no way that vulnerable areas such as the island region of the Caribbean can cope with the devastation that such phenomena inflict on our peoples and countries. As an example, take my own country, the Dominican Republic. This year, natural phenomena in the form of rains and floods have damaged thousands of kilometres of highways and roads, resulting in substantial losses. Dozens of bridges have collapsed and miles of retaining walls and irrigation canals have been destroyed. Thousands of acres of mixed farmland that are vital to keeping our people fed every day have been lost. In addition, among much other damage, hundreds of homes have been destroyed, not counting those hit by Hurricane Irma. We have spent more than $500 million on rescue and relief operations just in the past few months. We are therefore concerned about the fact that similar, or even more powerful, events resulting from climate change have the potential to set the development of ours and other Caribbean countries back 10 years. I am talking about snatching away a whole peopleâ??s happiness and prospects for the future. That is not something we can continue to take lightly. It is in that context that the work of the United Nations and the solidarity between our countries make most sense. On behalf of all the men, women, children and elderly people who are utterly desperate right now, I urge all of us to seek ways for the United Nations to support Governments that cannot cope on their own in rebuilding their countries in the wake of natural disasters. Let us take the necessary steps to make that aid available and ensure that it reaches those in desperate need. It is part of our responsibility as brother nations. I would also like to call on the countries of the United Nations to reflect anew, and urgently, on what we must do in order to counteract extreme climate events. The scientific evidence for the relationship between natural disasters, man-made change and global warming is quite sufficient. It is time for us to play our part and act to slow down events, or the future will judge us for our total lack of responsibility. Since the Organization was founded, 72 years ago, our country has been a member of the unique experience in the history of humankind that is its creation. Since then, the United Nations has been a beacon pointing the way to a future of hope. We must never fall into complacency on that road. We know that essential aspects of our civilization, such as peace, security and development, are not gifts that drop from the sky. They are not something that we can take for granted. They are the result of a commitment between our peoples that must be constantly renewed and that we must keep working for. The Dominican Republic is fully committed to that vision and to the search for comprehensive solutions to the challenges facing the international community. We are determined to contribute energetically to building an ever-more democratic, participatory and effective United Nations to help solve our peoplesâ?? real problems.",1,196
7750,Session 72 - 2017,DZA_72_2017.txt,DZA_72_2017,72,2017,DZA,"At the outset, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency to the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We assure him of my countryâ??s full support. I would also like to express my appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, Foreign Minister of Fiji. I thank him for the excellent work that he performed during the past session At each session of the General Assembly, we repeat our diagnosis of the miserable state of the world. Unfortunately, this session is no exception, given that it is being held in a context in which protracted crises continue, new and bloody conflicts are breaking out and hotspots are waiting for settlements that are harder to achieve than ever before. Our time is also marked by the fragile ecological balance of the planet owing to all of the damage that it has incurred. We add to that extreme poverty, backwardness and diseases that continue to kill millions, as well as threats spreading across borders, such as terrorism and the associated organized crime, which directly affect the safety and stability of our countries. The challenges that we face cannot be underestimated, nor can they be ignored. In every situation, we must not doubt our ability to confront those challenges and overcome them. In the words of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, which he shared with the General Assembly as President at its twenty-ninth session in 1974: â??[o]ur responsibility is less to turn our backs on reality than, rather, to face up to it rigorously and vigilantlyâ??. Despite the fact that the United Nations can be improved in more than one area, it remains the only crucial means at nationsâ?? disposal and has been described by President Bouteflika as representing a monument of harmony and solidarity among all the nations of the world. I would like to express our satisfaction with the topic of this yearâ??s session, namely, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, which powerfully encapsulates the challenges that we are facing today. In confronting numerous crises, hotspots and the terrible human tragedies that they leave in their wake, we can only question our collective conscience over the deep-rooted causes that have led to the failure of the collective security system that was designed by the founding fathers of our Organization as a fortress that would forever protect future generations from the scourge of war. We must therefore work in unison to reform the Organization so that it can fully shoulder the responsibilities that it was established to assume, whether in terms of preventing conflict, promoting peace or respecting human rights, or in realizing the right to self-determination. The time has come to implement a fundamental reform for the Organization, including its structure and management, and, in the reform process, we must primarily focus on the Security Council as a starting point. We must remedy the historical injustice embodied in the absence of African representation in both categories of membership of that organ. Membership must be expanded so that it represents the important actors in the international arena. I believe that there is also growing consensus on the need to revitalize and strengthen the authority of the General Assembly, which for the first time has interacted directly and innovatively in the process of the selection and appointment of the Secretary- General, thereby confirming its trust in him and his legitimacy to fulfil his mandate. That selection was unanimous. The appointment of Mr. Guterres, whose personal and professional characteristics we admire, was unanimous, which confirms the appropriateness of the new procedure. Algeria remains committed to certain basic foreign- policy principles that are derived from the Charter of the United Nations, namely, respect for the independence and territorial integrity of States, non-intervention in other countriesâ?? internal affairs, the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the right to self-determination. Algeria will continue to act in accordance with those principles and will always support political rather than military solutions in the settlement of conflicts, be they in Syria, Yemen, Mali, Libya or elsewhere. With regard to two of its neighbours, Algeria is convinced that the people of Mali must choose dialogue and negotiations if the country is to overcome the difficulties that lie in the path of implementing the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. In order for Libyans to preserve their unity and territorial integrity, it is crucial that they settle their differences under the supervision of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, with the support of neighbouring countries. On the other hand, we in Algeria believe that the Western Sahara issue is a matter of decolonization, which falls within the purview of the United Nations. Accordingly, we believe that there can be no viable solution if the people of Western Sahara are not able to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination. In that regard, Algeria hopes that the appointment of Mr. Horst KÃ¶hler as United Nations Personal Envoy for Western Sahara will help to bring about the resumption of negotiations between the two sides to the conflict, namely, the Kingdom of Morocco and Frente Polisario, and assist in moving the country along the path towards decolonization, in accordance with the principles of international legitimacy and the relevant Security Council resolutions. Algeria would like once again to express its regret over the inability of the international community to put an end to Israelâ??s occupation of Arab territories. We reiterate our support for the Palestinian people as they strive to regain their legitimate national rights and establish their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital. Combating terrorism and violent extremism, which is a source of terrorism, unfortunately remains a priority on the international agenda. The terrorist threat has been far-reaching in nature and continues to be so. We are reminded of that fact by the tragedies caused by the numerous terrorist attacks in the Middle East and Sahel regions, not to mention the long list of such attacks perpetrated this year in other parts of the world. Extremism is spreading at an ever-faster rate owing to the emergence of the Internet and social networking sites. The Organizationâ??s strategy for combating violent extremism must therefore take that reality into account. It must also prompt countries to combat the spread of Islamophobia at the individual and collective levels. We also note that the repatriation of foreign terrorist fighters requires the international community to mobilize greater efforts to counter the dangerous threats that they bring back to their countries of origin. Algeria is fully aware of the dangers of terrorism and transborder organized crime in its immediate vicinity. Algeria maintains the highest degree of caution internally and on its borders, thereby enhancing its commitment to combating those phenomena at the regional and international levels. Algeriaâ??s experiences have been recorded in two published collections, one of which pertains to democracy and the role of national reconciliation in combating terrorism and violent extremism. The evolving nature of migration, be it legal or illegal, will inevitably offer opportunities to benefit our economies and societies. However, some forms of migration cause extreme harm to those involved, as well as to the countries connected with the phenomenon. By virtue of its geographical location, Algeria is at the forefront in dealing with unregulated migration. In the past, Algeria was a country of origin and a transit country, but today Algeria is a destination country for such human flows. As a result, it understands the complex nature of the issue. We believe that it is important to continue to work together to find comprehensive, integrated and balanced solutions based on a fair division of responsibilities, with a view to preserving the dignity of those who have been forced by fear or poverty to take the dangerous road of migration, exposing themselves to the risk of abuse by organized transborder criminal gangs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third International Conference on Financing for Development have offered some important gains, and we must mobilize all ways and means to fulfil and preserve them. We believe that we have an excellent tool in our hands, namely, the United Nations Development Programme and related entities, for helping developing States to formulate policy and undertake domestic development efforts. Before I conclude, I would like to inform the General Assembly of some of the domestic activities that Algeria has been undertaking. Pursuant to the directives of the President of the Republic, in July 2016 we adopted a new development plan that aims to expand our emerging national economy with an eye on the 2030 horizon. The plan involves the rational management of financial resources so that the gains achieved through social justice and national cohesion may be preserved. In that regard, Algeria has committed itself to implementing Agenda 2030 by mobilizing national efforts and taking advantage of the capacities of all partners, including civil society. Those efforts, which involve all sectors, seek to diversify the national economy and achieve sustainable development. Having realized the need to enhance the rights and independence of women and in the light of the attention that the United Nations gives to those issues, I would like to reiterate Algeriaâ??s commitment to the subject of womenâ??s rights. The Algerian Constitution was amended in 2016 to enshrine that deliberate approach, and that has been reflected in the improved situation of women in rural areas, in local councils, in both chambers of Parliament, as well as in the top positions in the State. That won Algeria an award from the African Union in 2016, as part of its Human Rights Decade. Algeria received another award in 2017 in the area of enhancing the rights of women. Youth constitute three quarters of the population and are considered another major priority of the Algerian State, which, in a constitutional amendment, established a High Council for Youth. Moreover, Algeria has for years been working hard to take advantage of that important human resource, which is of such socioeconomic importance. The educational sector has also witnessed important efforts by Government authorities to offer education to youth, that important part of society. Algeria has been ranked third in Africa and first in the Maghreb area in human development. It is also worth mentioning that in August Gallup Inc., an international institute for opinion polls, ranked Algeria sixth on its list of safest countries in the world. Those are the points that I wanted to leave with the membership on behalf of Algeria as we commence our work at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly.",1,196
7751,Session 72 - 2017,ECU_72_2017.txt,ECU_72_2017,72,2017,ECU,"As I speak from this rostrum today, I can affirm that much progress has been made to achieve inclusion and accessibility; however, as a society we still have much that remains to be done for the worldâ??s 1 billion people living with disabilities. I am an optimist. We are entirely capable of finding solutions; it is a matter of political will. That is why I am grateful for the accommodations that have been made to enable me to address the General Assembly today. I congratulate the President, Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, for proposing the topic for the general debate, namely,â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Those are truly todayâ??s imperatives. Without a doubt, a responsible Government must take care of its citizens so that all of them may have a decent life on a sustainable planet where every day we work towards achieving peace. Our Government philosophy agrees that we must care for our citizens throughout their lives, from the moment of conception to when God decides to close our eyes. We must ensure a good life and a good death. That is why we have organized the Governmentâ??s work around a plan that we have called â??A Whole Lifeâ??. A responsible country and Government must care for, inspire, encourage, support and be good to its citizens throughout their entire lives under the principle of co-responsibility. Taking care of citizens begins with prenatal services. After birth, we need to provide medical care for the child, appropriate nutrition, vaccinations, neonatal screening and early intervention. Then comes the stage when we must inspire the new human being and foster their love for science, knowledge, art and sports to shape their will and mind, thereby awakening their consciousness and planting the seeds of the values within them that will serve as the basis for their adult life. In the next stage of life, it is crucial for us to propel our young people forward with an education â?? a high quality higher education â?? facilitating in that way the fulfilment of their endeavours, projects and dreams. Beyond that stage, we must provide support to individuals with a view to ensuring the well-being of their families â?? the right to social security, housing, employment, recreation and a safe and healthy environment. At the end comes the stage of gratitude when we give back to the people who have served their societies and families â?? the care and services that we provide to our senior citizens. Within that vision of ensuring the rights of each individual throughout their entire life, there persists an urgent need to eradicate all forms of violence. Today all of humankind has a moral and ethical duty â?? we must prohibit the abuse and killing of thousands of women and girls. There can be no more femicides, not even one. Our â??A Whole Lifeâ?? plan is, in sum, how we in Ecuador have interpreted our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals. We unquestionably inherited the notion from our indigenous peoples that the world must be focused on the human being and their relationship to nature, in which the beginning and the end is to meet the needs of all and make possible a life with dignity. My indigenous brothers and sisters taught me that we were born to be happy, and it is upon that premise that we must govern, live, manage and act. However, we must also recognize that we are experiencing a difficult and painful time as human beings. We are facing many crises. We see a potential nuclear conflict, greater levels of inequality and poverty and a planet that must fight the devastating effects of climate change. If we continue along such a path, there is no doubt that we are moving towards destruction. Clearly that is evidence of the fact that we, the human race, are failing. We must commit to achieving peace. Consistent with that need, today Ecuador is acceding to the Treaty to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons. We call on all countries to accede to that historic international instrument. We know that the military industry is a big business, which is why arms traffickers, and not arms producers, are prosecuted and convicted. What ethics are at play here? How is it possible that resources that could be devoted to financing the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals are wasted on the absurdity of war? We firmly believe that peace and development are achieved through dialogue; but if we continue with wars and blockades against countries and peoples, such as the blockade against our brother country Cuba, we will never be able to achieve true liberty and democracy. We therefore insist that the sovereignty of States and non-intervention must be respected. We call for dialogue as a mechanism to resolve differences around the globe, with full respect for international law. Military intervention is not the answer, as it only brings with it suffering, pain and death. We therefore resolutely support the peace talks that the Government of Colombia is holding in our country with the National Liberation Army. We welcome the agreement reached in Quito, which was announced a few days ago, for a bilateral temporary ceasefire in Columbia. Step-by- step we are nearing the goal of having the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States become a region of peace. As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, we have before us another major challenge â?? the alarming inequality in the world. It is unacceptable for eight people in the world to possess the same wealth as one half of humankindâ??s poorest. Such injustice goes against the rights to development and human dignity. A way to immediately confront inequality would be to institute fair tax measures. We must fight tax evasion and avoidance: those hidden resources are vital for the development of our countries. Furthermore, the use of tax shelters has served to hide corruption within both the public and the private sectors. If we truly want to fight corruption, we must encourage a culture of transparency. In our country, by popular agreement, the people of Ecuador decided that no public servant can have resources or goods in tax havens. As Chair of the Group of 77 and China, Ecuador has promoted a global agenda for fair tax actions. We reiterate the need to create an intergovernmental body on tax cooperation at the United Nations. Another mechanism for promoting transparency would be a binding instrument on transnational corporations and human rights. We appreciate the support of all countries that share our views on such an initiative. Looking at the devastation caused by climatic phenomena in recent weeks, I would be remiss if I did not express my solidarity with the peoples affected and turn to address one of the greatest challenges that humankind faces, that is, the responsibility to combat climate change. We must take care of our common home and ensure the survival of the planet. The unlimited exploitation of the environment has led us to live with the consequences of climate change. We, the developing countries, are those that pay the highest costs. Countries have common but differentiated responsibilities. Those who pollute the most must take greater responsibility. As the Assembly knows, Ecuador is one of the eight Amazonian countries. Having been born and raised in the Ecuadorian Amazon, I have a duty to promote the protection of the largest hydrographic basin in the world. In the dialogue convened by the Secretary-General, I presented the Amazon initiative to stop deforestation and combat climate change. We advocate compliance with all international agreements for the protection of nature, including the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans. We encourage bioknowledge and the bioeconomy. We must protect and make the most of the knowledge of the guardians of nature, in particular indigenous peoples, communities and nations. I would like to refer to another issue of enormous importance for todayâ??s world, namely, the migration crisis. Ecuador supports the principle of universal citizenship and free mobility, because we are increasingly interconnected, and the right to free mobility cannot be applied only to capital and goods. Human mobility enriches peoples and contributes to combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia. We strongly support the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is being discussed here in the Assembly. Closing borders is not the solution. It has never been the solution in the history of humankind. When I formed my Government, I called for major national dialogue, without excluding anyone, in order to reach agreements that would allow us to build a more humane, just and democratic society. Dialogue is the only tool for building societies of peace. That means societies with jobs, high-quality education, access to health care as a right, decent housing and access to basic services. Through dialogue, democracy is built, which is both a means of moving forward and our final goal. Democracy is strengthened by generating and promoting spaces for young people to participate in politics. We have an obligation to generate new leadership so that they can take our place when the time comes. We must maintain the defence of fundamental liberties, including those of expression and worship. We must promote a new international order based on peace, respect for differences, equality and solidarity. We do not want merely compassionate societies, but rather societies that feature solidarity. That is why we need fundamental love for others, honesty and a sense of community. Faced with the failure of a development model based on accumulation, inequality and war, we can, and must, foster a new society based on the construction of the common good. All countries can achieve development with equity, if we have a fair international system and if we commit ourselves to the eradication of poverty and inequality. Our challenges are great, but I am convinced that we are capable of overcoming them. My deep optimism lies in the confidence that dialogue, political decision-making and collective action will enable us to build a more humane and more just world in which we can live with dignity.",1,196
7752,Session 72 - 2017,EC_72_2017.txt,EC_72_2017,72,2017,EC,"The European Union (EU) stands for freedom and a credible rules- based global order, because that order is a real sine qua non condition for peace, stability and a global economy that works for everyone. An alternative to that order is chaos, which always encourages violence, egoism and extremism. The United Nations is the best tool we have to address, on a global scale, todayâ??s conflicts, famine, forced displacement, terrorism and a return to nuclear tensions. For the EU and its member States, it is imperative that the United Nations rise to those challenges. That is why, together, we contribute approximately one third of United Nations core financing, make one third of United Nations peacekeeping contributions and put in half of all voluntary contributions to United Nations funds and programmes. However, we also expect the United Nations to become a more energetic and a less bureaucratic Organization that can act with clarity and purpose in all its actions. Therefore, the EU considers the ideas for reforming the United Nations currently on the table as the necessary minimum. What is needed is more ambition, not less. The United Nations remains a vital forum for debate and a tool to implement our collective will, even if it has declined in popular esteem in recent years. I take the action by the Security Council on 11 September (see S/PV.8042) to sanction North Korea for carrying out more nuclear testing as a sign that the capacity for real leadership and unity is present. Nevertheless, it is still too little. No country should be allowed to undermine the global non-proliferation regime or to threaten peaceful countries. Together with Japan and South Korea, our close friends and strategic partners, the European Union calls for a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We also call on all concerned to uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran as a multilateral deal that is delivering more security for us all. Europe also wants to work in partnership with African countries on challenges ranging from security and counter-terrorism to economic growth and job creation. We look forward to advancing those goals together at the African-European summit in Ivory Coast at the end of November. The European Union is already cooperating closely with United Nations missions on peacekeeping and conflict prevention in Mali, the Central African Republic and other conflict zones. We are also doing our best to alleviate a major humanitarian crisis, affecting more than 20 million people, in the Lake Chad basin, South Sudan and Somalia. Yet more needs to be done. Now is the time to wake up to those escalating situations before it is really too late. When it comes to the global refugee crisis, the EU continues to assume its responsibility by receiving people in need of protection and by assisting host countries closer to the conflict zones. For three years now, the EU has appealed to the international community to take up its responsibility for refugee protection and irregular migration. I am doing the same today. In that context, the European Union is actively supporting the United Nations process to develop global compacts for refugees and for regular, safe and orderly migration. The engagement of Member States is needed right now, both in terms of money for humanitarian assistance and more resettlement for those displaced by conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar and especially across Africa. At the same time, we should crack down on human smugglers, who exploit vulnerable people and violate sovereign borders. I welcome that the International Criminal Court Prosecutor is investigating the smugglers in Libya for crimes against humanity. We should treat them, via a system of international sanctions, just as harshly as those engaged in terrorism and piracy. The European Union calls on international agencies to increase their presence on the ground in Libya immediately, so that we can work to improve the situation of those victimized by the smugglers. The year 2017 showed us that Daâ??esh as a territorial entity is fated for defeat, which is good news. Sadly, however, repeated terrorist attacks, including in Europe, demonstrate that the threat continues. We need to keep on strengthening the global fight against terrorism and violent extremism. In short, we must be more determined than they are. Doing more on counter-radicalization within the United Nations is badly needed. We welcome the establishment by the industry of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to work in tandem with United Nations structures. The European Union has called on the major online companies to develop, as a priority, the means for automatic deletion of extremist content immediately after posting. To the Muslim leaders of the world, I repeat the appeal I made after the London Bridge attack in June: their strong stance against Islamist extremism will be a real support in the fight against terrorism. Finally, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is the cornerstone of global efforts to tackle climate change in an effective way and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The EU remains determined to implement the Agreement swiftly and fully and to support our partners, in particular vulnerable countries, in the fight against climate change. We will work with all partners that share our conviction that the Agreement is necessary to protect our planet, that it is fit for purpose and that, in turn, it is good for economic growth and future jobs. We meet at a time when the world is poised between hope and fear. The global economy and trade are expanding, but security tensions are rising and global cooperation is being increasingly questioned. Making international action robust, credible and transformative is the challenge. The European Union will never give up working with and within the United Nations until we meet this challenge. The European Union and the United Nations were created in answer to the atrocities of the Second World War. That is why our European priority will always be to react vigorously against evil, violence and lawlessness in international life. When confronting evil, the EU and the United Nations cannot hesitate. In our political life there are situations that are black and white and are crystal clear, such as the case of North Koreaâ??s nuclear blackmail, terrorism, and the aggression on Ukraine. It is in such cases that we need to demonstrate that we are still able to distinguish between good and evil. Sometimes that takes courage, but the United Nations is not there to cowardly look for a compromise with evil, but to mobilize the global community in the fight against it. Therefore a moral judgment of reality, clear and univocal, should be the first principle of our common action. Many people in the world still believe that in this Hall have gathered those who have not given up on the ethical dimension of politics in the name of their own egoistic interests. Let us show them that their trust is justified.",1,196
7753,Session 72 - 2017,EGY_72_2017.txt,EGY_72_2017,72,2017,EGY,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to wish him every success in carrying out his duties. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson, the outgoing President, who so ably oversaw the Assemblyâ??s work at its seventy- first session. Each time we meet in this Hall, we rekindle the hopes and aspirations of the peoples whom we are honoured to represent and serve. We hope to provide them with peace and development. New generations look up to us to realize their dreams for a decent life within a just international order. It is a global order that can face challenges such as climate change, natural disasters, diseases and epidemics, as well as other man-made crises â?? war, terrorism and huge discrepancies in the distribution of resources and development opportunities. It is evident that the purposes and principles of the United Nations are still valid as a basis for a world that offers everyone an opportunity to benefit from the great strides being made in scientific advancement and economic development, as well as from the information revolution, which has brought societies unprecedentedly closer. Those developments offer great potential for establishing a fair and secure international order â?? one that is based on the right to development, freedom and progress and open interactions between people. In Egypt, we adamantly believe in the values of the United Nations and the purposes of its Charter. We have great confidence that realizing those values is not only possible, but rather an obligation and a necessity. Egyptâ??s long-standing involvement with the United Nations â?? both as a founding Member of the Organization that has been elected to the Security Council six times and as the seventh-largest contributor to peacekeeping operations worldwide â?? bears witness to our constant striving to build a world that is worthy of the aspirations of our children and grandchildren to live in freedom, dignity, security and prosperity. However, the responsibility that we bear requires that we be frank in saying that the world we seek, albeit possible, unfortunately still remains far from reality. We are still unable to prevent armed conflict, confront terrorism, eliminate nuclear weapons or address the structural imbalances in the international economic order that have widened the gap between the developed and developing worlds. Based on the experiences of the African and Arab regions, I can state with a clear conscience that those experiences summarize the current crisis of the international order and its inability to deliver on the goals of the United Nations. The Arab region, Egyptâ??s civilizational and cultural milieu, has today become an epicentre for some of the most vicious civil conflicts in recent human history. It is the region most vulnerable to the dangers posed by terrorism. One out of every three refugees in the world today is an Arab, and the Mediterranean Sea has become a conduit for irregular migrants from Asian and African States fleeing the scourge of civil strife, as well as the despair of economic and social hardships. That is reflected in the Arab regional report on multidimensional poverty in Arab countries published by the League of Arab States in collaboration with the United Nations. The report will be issued tomorrow. As Egyptâ??s geographical home, Africa lies at the heart of Egyptâ??s foreign policy. It is Africa where our historic roots lie, and it is from Africa that we derive pride in our identity and our deep sense of belonging. The continent has also become subject to the same security threats facing the Arab region and constitutes a major example of the crisis in the current international economic order that perpetuates poverty and economic disparity. This global order bears a major responsibility in the economic, political and social crises that threaten international peace and stability, rendering any discussion on the Sustainable Development Goals just words without evidence based on reality. Egypt is therefore encircled by the most dangerous crises in the world. It is our destiny to navigate confidently through those unprecedented dangers, while relying on an ambitious development strategy based on radical, bold economic reforms. Those reforms aim, above all else, to empower the youth, who represent the majority of the population, not only in Egypt but also in most of the Arab countries and the developing world. In a world that is interconnected, complex and full of challenges that cannot be confronted by one country alone, regardless of its capabilities, it is natural for Egyptâ??s ambitious development plans to correlate with an active foreign policy. That foreign policy strategy is guided by the long-established moral principles ingrained in our heritage and culture and abides by the legal principles of the international system, which Egypt actively participated in formulating. It is based on a vision to address the shortcomings that have prevented the realization of the objectives of the United Nations. Our vision is based on the following five main principles and priorities. First, the only possible solution to the crises afflicting the Arab region is through persistently upholding the notion of the modern nation-State based on the principles of citizenship, equality, the rule of law and human rights, and thereby defeating any attempts to retreat into doctrinal, sectarian, ethnic or tribal loyalties. The path towards reform inevitably includes embracing the nation-State and cannot be built on its demise. This principle, in summary, lies at the core of Egyptâ??s foreign policy and is the foundation upon which we base our positions in addressing the crises in our region. With regard to brotherly Syria, we believe there will be no salvation for Syria except through a consensual political solution among all Syrians. At its core is the preservation of the unity of the Syrian State, the maintenance of its institutions and the broadening of its political and social base to include all sectors of Syrian society, as well as the decisive confrontation of terrorism until it is defeated. The way to this solution is through the United Nations-led negotiation process, which enjoys strong support from Egypt. Equally as strong is our objection to any attempt to manipulate the tragedy in Syria to establish international or regional zones of influence or carry out the subversive policies of some regional parties â?? parties whose practices have caused great suffering to our region over the past few years. It is now high time for a final and decisive confrontation with those practices. Similarly, we believe that a political settlement is the only viable solution to the crisis in Libya. Libya continues to face attempts to dismantle the State and turn it into an open field for tribal conflict, a field of operations for terrorist organizations. I would like clearly to underscore that Egypt will not allow the continuation of attempts to tamper with the unity and integrity of the Libyan State or undermine the capabilities of the Libyan people. We will continue to work diligently with the United Nations to achieve a political settlement based on the Skhirat Agreement and inspired by the recommendations agreed upon by Libyans. The recommendations that emerged from their consecutive meetings in Cairo during the past months aim to end the political stalemate and revive the settlement process in the country. The same logic applies to Egyptâ??s strategy in Iraq and Yemen: the only way to overcome the crises is with a unified, capable and just modern nation-State that realizes the legitimate aspirations of the Arab people. Secondly, it is time for a comprehensive and final settlement to the longest-standing crisis in the Arab region, namely, the question of Palestine. This is a clear depiction of the international communityâ??s inability to implement a long series of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. The closure of this chapter â?? through a fair settlement based on established international norms and by establishing an independent Palestinian State along the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital â?? is a necessary precondition for the entire region to transition into a phase of stability and development. That is also necessary to restore the credibility of the United Nations and the international order. Achieving peace will without a doubt eliminate one of the main excuses that terrorism has been using to justify its proliferation in the region. It will guarantee a dignified and peaceful life for the peoples of the region. It is time to permanently overcome the barrier of hatred forever. I would like to underscore here that Arabs still extend their hand in peace. Egyptâ??s experience proves that peace is possible, and is indeed a realistic objective that we should all continue to pursue seriously. Before I continue my statement, allow me to veer off script for a moment and call directly upon everyone who is concerned by this issue. My first audience is the Palestinian people. I say to them that it is extremely important to unite behind a common goal, overcome differences, not to lose opportunities and be ready to accept coexistence with the other â?? with Israelis â?? to achieve stability and security for all. I now direct my call to the Israeli people. In Egypt we have an excellent track record of peace with Israelis that spans more than 40 years. It is possible to repeat that experience â?? an excellent step to achieve peace and security for both Israeli and Palestinian citizens. My call to Israelis is to stand behind their political leadership and support it without hesitation. I urge the Israeli public not to hesitate. We are all with them for the success of that attempt. This opportunity might not repeat itself. My other call is to all nations that love peace and stability. All Arab States support Israelâ??s excellent endeavour. Other nations, too, must support its endeavour, which, if successful, will change the face of history. I also address the American leadership and the American President: we have an opportunity to turn over a new page in human history and achieve peace in the region. The third of my main principles and priorities is that it is impossible to envisage a future for the regional or international order in which we have not definitively and comprehensively addressed terrorism. That should be approached in a manner that eradicates terrorism and eliminates its roots and causes, while also openly challenging any party that supports or finances terrorism or that offers it political and media channels or safe havens. Frankly, there is no room for any serious discussion on the credibility of a system that applies double standards â?? a system that fights terrorism while tolerating its supporters and engaging them in discussions on how to eliminate a threat that they created in the first place. To be truthful and faithful to our peoples, members of various international alliances should answer the pertinent questions that we are raising out of devotion to our people. Answers are usually avoided by those who prefer duplicity to attain narrow political interests in the demise of States and at the expense of blood shed by their people. We will not allow our peoplesâ?? sacrifices to be made in vain, under any circumstances. We in the Muslim world need to face up to our reality and work together to rectify the misconstrued notions that have become an ideological pretext for terrorism and its destructive discourse. As members may recall, Egypt launched an initiative to rectify religious discourse in order to revive the true and tolerant values of Islam. Egyptâ??s religious institutions are currently engaged in that process, in coordination with the relevant international entities. Egypt, which is currently engaged in an unrelenting battle to eradicate terrorism from its territory, is committed to tracking, confronting and eliminating terrorism decisively, wherever it exists. It is evident that confronting terrorism has been at the forefront of Egyptâ??s priorities during its 2016-2017 membership in the Security Council and during our chairmanship of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee. We do not wish to defend only Egyptâ??s future, but also the future of the international community as a whole. Our fourth priority is to eliminate the root causes of international crises and the sources of threat to international stability, That requires the operationalization of the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility among the members of the international community, in order to narrow the economic and social gaps between developed and developing countries. How can the United Nations, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals have any credibility when the international economic order is itself responsible for augmenting disparities, in a manner inconsistent with the values of justice and equality? How can there be any opportunity for less developed countries, no matter how determined they are, to implement fundamental economic reforms to address the mismanagement of their resources without addressing imbalances in the international economic order? Such endeavours require greater involvement by developing countries in international economic governance structures and facilitating their access to easier financing, markets and technology transfer. Fifthly, settling disputes in our world today can be achieved only through respect for the principles of international law and negotiation on the basis of legal, historic and moral principles, as well respect for the sovereignty of States and the principle of non-intervention in individual Statesâ?? internal affairs. More than seven decades after the establishment of the United Nations, force and zero-sum games cannot remain as a means to realize interests â?? especially in todayâ??s world, which is based on interdependence among nations and where there are significant opportunities for cooperation and understanding to achieve the common interests of all. Based on the principles I have mentioned, Egypt was at the forefront of countries eager to initiate the Nile Basin initiative in 1999. Egypt also pursued the conclusion of a trilateral agreement between Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia to address the issue of the Renaissance Dam from a cooperative perspective, in a manner that establishes a clear legal framework to manage the issue in accordance with international law, established principles and the well-established rules that govern relations between States sharing basins of transboundary rivers throughout the world. That agreement remains as a legal framework that can be used as an example to reflect the logic of cooperation and sharing among the three parties, as long as good faith continues. It is of paramount importance to implement the agreement, in the light of the limited amount of time available, to avoid squandering the opportunity of presenting a successful model to manage relations between three sisterly countries in the Nile basin. Our meeting here today is an opportunity for truthful self-reflection, in which we should acknowledge the various deficiencies that are hindering the international system from delivering on the noble objectives and aspirations it was set up to realize. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to establish a more equitable international order, given that the attainment of justice globally remains a necessary condition to confront the immense challenges impacting our world today and endangering the credibility of the international system. The humanitarian tragedy of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar is yet another reason to remind the international community of its moral obligations, not to mention its legal responsibilities, as reflected in the Charter of the United Nations. We must promptly work towards a lasting solution that ends the plight of civilians and addresses the root causes of the crisis, which has become a threat to regional security and the stability of neighbouring countries. Let us move together to empower the people of the world to regain control of their destinies and to explore new horizons of cooperation between members of the international community. Let us transcend the vicious cycle of narrow interests and the futile logic of power politics to the broader horizons of common human interests and cooperation among all. Let us be true to ourselves and dispel the mentality of polarizing policies. The world today is in dire need of the upholding of common human interests. It is incumbent upon all States to strive to further relations among all partners with malice towards none. I have conveyed Egyptâ??s message to the General Assembly today explicitly and clearly. I am full of hope that our joint efforts during the upcoming period will lead to a better world that is more secure, stable and prosperous. Long live Egypt!",1,196
7754,Session 72 - 2017,ERI_72_2017.txt,ERI_72_2017,72,2017,ERI,"It is another year and another session of the General Assembly. We meet in the same Assembly Hall and deliver our addresses from the same rostrum, yet no modicum of protocol can mask the gaping divide in our ranks. We live in an increasingly fragile, unjust and unequal world. A small minority holds the reins of power and wealth among nations and, for the most part, within nations. The overwhelming majority of nations and their citizens are without power, without voice, without the means for a decent life, and often without peace and security. We may be called the United Nations, but the reality is that we are divided nations and societies. Despite our deep divisions, however, our destinies are intertwined in a fundamental way. We share a common home: a small planet in a vast universe, a tiny boat in a vast ocean. Whatever calamity happens anywhere in our world â?? epidemics, poverty, violence, mass displacement, war, terror â?? it will eventually catch up with all of us. We share the responsibility to address the fundamental problems of our common world. Certainly, the mighty and wealthy should shoulder bigger responsibility, as they command vast power and resources. It is only fair that more is asked of those to whom much has been given â?? or, more accurately, those who have appropriated much for themselves. We should unflaggingly remind them of their obligations and press them not for charity, but for enlightened self- interest that understands that might is not permanent and that only shared benefits are sustainable. We would, however, be gravely mistaken and would have forgotten the lessons of history if we pinned all our hopes on the goodwill of those who currently enjoy disproportionate power, wealth and influence. Power does not readily concede its privileges of its own accord. It resorts to deception, coercion, pressure, sanctions, violence and war to maintain and, if possible, increase its privileges. The developing countries and the marginalized peoples of the globe stand to gain most from a more peaceful, secure, just and equal world. They owe it to themselves and to coming generations to build solidarity and to steadfastly strive and work and innovate for a better world. It is their duty to ensure freedom, dignity and prosperity for their peoples. Africa remains the most marginalized of all continents. Undoubtedly, there is some progress, more in some countries than in others. But talk of an African Renaissance, of fastest-growing economies, is misplaced and premature. We should not flatter ourselves or allow others to flatter us. Africa remains a producer and small-bit exporter of primary products. It retains minimum revenue from those exports, with foreign companies getting the lionâ??s share. Processing of primary products, value addition, industrialization and technology development barely exist. African economies, physical and social infrastructure, institutional and governance structures, and peace and security architectures remain undeveloped. Yet Africa boasts tremendous human and natural resources. Indeed, over 60 per cent of global natural resources lie in Africa. It is only when Africaâ??s economies, the quality of its infrastructure, the standards of its health and educational institutions, the level of its artistic, scientific and technological products, the effectiveness of its institutions and enterprises and, more importantly, the quality of life of its citizens reflect more accurately its great potential that we can rightly speak of Africa taking its rightful place in the world. We should safeguard independence and sovereignty, fight ethnic polarization and rampant corruption, chart our own paths, develop bold and imaginative policies that suit our conditions, rely mainly on our own resources and build an Africa that meets the aspirations of its people and makes valuable contributions to humankind. Eritrea is a young, strategically located nation with significant human and natural resources. It joined the community of independent nations a quarter of a century ago by dint of its peopleâ??s 30-year struggle for freedom and self-determination, fought and won against tremendous odds. As an independent nation, it has faced the full brunt of an unfair and unjust international order. It has faced demonization, ostracism, sanctions and armed aggression, and that sustained external hostility caused much harm to Eritrea and its people. It slowed down Eritreaâ??s progress, but it was not able to stop it. It could not shake the resolve of the Eritrean people and their Government. Eritrea was severely tested but emerged intact, more determined, more experienced and in many ways stronger. It is peaceful, stable, secure and harmonious: a haven of stability in a turbulent neighbourhood. Eritrea is, quietly and without fanfare, engaged in comprehensive nation-building. It is pursuing policies and taking concrete measures to strengthen the unity and harmony of its people, fostering their political participation and unleashing their energies and talents. It is laying the groundwork for broad-based and sustainable economic development. It is putting modern infrastructure in place, step by step. It is working to ensure that all its citizens get good access to nutritious food, clean water, electricity, shelter, transport, communications, health care and educational services, as well as cultural, sports and recreational facilities. Eritrea has also embarked on a massive water and soil conservation programme and an afforestation programme as part of its comprehensive plan to enhance the environment and fight climate change. Eritrea is confident that it will meet the Sustainable Development Goals ahead of time. In its ambitious development programme, Eritrea avoids dependency and relies first and foremost on its people and on its domestic resources. At the same time, it welcomes and encourages cooperation and partnership, with a focus on trade and investment. Eritrea also seeks to make a modest contribution to peace, stability and cooperation in its wider region, which includes the Nile basin, the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea basin and the Gulf. It has successfully fought and continues to fight radicalization, extremism and terrorism both on its own and in cooperation with its neighbours. Eritrea extends its hands of friendship and solidarity to all peoples and nations who strive to build their countries and contribute to a fairer, more just and more equal world. Eritrea takes the initiative to engage with all countries, including those who differ with it. Eritrea strongly believes that its political, economic, social and diplomatic path would be smoother and easier if the external obstacles that have been on its path were removed. It therefore once again calls on the Security Council to lift the unfair and unjust sanctions imposed on it for the past nine years. There is no justification for them to continue, and they do not serve any useful purpose. Another obstacle facing Eritrea â?? indeed, facing the whole Horn of Africa region â?? is the 15-year-old occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory by Ethiopia. Eritrea calls on the Security Council to ensure the end of that flagrant violation of international law and several United Nations resolutions.",1,196
7755,Session 72 - 2017,ESP_72_2017.txt,ESP_72_2017,72,2017,ESP,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly and to wish you every success in that important role. The seventy-second session is also the first of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterresâ??s term, and he can count on Spainâ??s unwavering support in carrying out his work. Spain wants to redouble its efforts to achieve a fairer, freer and more united world. That reaffirmation of our commitment makes particular sense in the wake of the ruthless terrorist attacks that struck the cities of Barcelona and Cambrils on 17 August. From this rostrum, I want to express the sincere gratitude of the Spanish people for the many heartfelt expressions of solidarity and affection that we have received from all over the world. Terrorism will be defeated with unity, perseverance and the full force of the law. Spain is a free and open society. Our rights and freedoms are protected by the social and democratic rule of law enshrined in our Constitution. The Spanish Government cannot, and will not, cease to defend the rule of law and the values it inspires â?? freedom, equality, justice and political pluralism. Spainâ??s public authorities have the duty to ensure the rights and freedoms of all Spaniards. Any challenge to the principles of democracy represents a serious attack on our peaceful and free coexistence. Pitting any alleged legitimate claim against the rule of law of the Constitution will inevitably result in the violation of the fundamental rights of millions of citizens and is incompatible with democracy. In the same conviction and determination with which we defend a constitutional and democratic Spain, we reaffirm the values, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As His Majesty King Don Felipe VI indicated from this rostrum a year ago, the Charter â??was not simply a beacon that lit the dark times of the past, but ... also illuminates our present and our future.â?? (A/71/PV.10, p. 6) Spain undertook its Security Council mandate during the 2015-2016 biennium with a sense of responsibility. We made significant contributions in the areas of non-proliferation, counter-terrorism and support for its victims, preventive diplomacy, the humanitarian agenda and increasing the transparency of the Councilâ??s work. We will bring the same attitude to our service on the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 triennium, if on 16 October the members of the Assembly entrust us with that responsibility. The defence and promotion of human rights is a priority of Spainâ??s foreign policy. Todayâ??s world is highly interdependent. Extreme poverty, hunger, desertification, global warming and the preservation of forests and oceans are serious and urgent challenges that require concerted action. Spain affirms its full commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which inspires our policies. We are preparing for a voluntary review of our implementation of the 2030 Agenda in July 2018. It requires us to make tremendous collective efforts to ensure that no one is left behind. We must work to combat inequality, foster prosperity and provide job opportunities to young people on a planet that must remain habitable for generations to come. The future livability of large areas of the planet is inextricably linked to fulfilment of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and we must act accordingly. Large displacements of people have reached unprecedented levels in recent years. The two global compacts on refugees and migrants that we have committed to adopting in 2018 should confirm our desire to provide a concerted, equitable and humane response to the problem of refugees and contribute to managing migrant flows among their countries of origin, transit and destination. Both issues deserve to be treated individually. Regrettably, the scourge of war and threats to peace persist in many parts of the world. We have been talking here about the conflict in Syria for seven years. We are heartened by the decrease in hostilities and by the victories against Daâ??esh, but we remain concerned about how specific interests are put ahead of a political solution that, with United Nations mediation, could lead to a genuine transition. The United Nations also has a central role in promoting a political agreement in Yemen that would end the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world today. Turning to Iraq, the Government has successfully reclaimed Mosul and other territories from the horror of Daâ??esh. Spain would like to help the new Iraq by, inter alia, assisting with the training of its security forces. We support the reconstruction of the country and reconciliation among its citizens, and we reject political undertakings that detract from key efforts to consolidate a free, democratic and united Iraq. In Lebanon, we welcome the recent renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, an operation in which Spainâ??s armed forces play a substantive part. We count on the rigorous implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, which will contribute to nuclear non-proliferation and peace in the region. On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the parties must return to the spirit of Madrid and to the negotiating table. The status quo is not sustainable. We are concerned about the trends we see on the ground that are inconsistent with the two-State solution. Only two democratic States, living side by side within secure and recognized borders, will meet the legitimate expectations of Israelis and Palestinians. Spain has always accorded priority to the Mediterranean, which we have sought to transform into an area of peace and prosperity. To that end, it is vital to encourage greater cooperation, such as that promoted by the Union for the Mediterranean. Peace and prosperity in the Maghreb are of prime importance to Spain. My country welcomes the Secretary-Generalâ??s intention to resume talks between the parties to the Western Sahara dispute. We are confident that his new Personal Envoy will facilitate progress towards a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that offers self-determination to the people of Western Sahara, in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The new Special Representative of the Secretary- General in Libya has Spainâ??s full support in his efforts to find a political solution based on a united country and in accordance with the Libyan Political Agreement. Spain pays special and preferential attention to the African continent. Africa needs peace, stability, economic growth and sound institutions. We firmly believe in its potential, which will be compounded when conflicts cease, peace has been consolidated and social cohesion deepens. CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire and Liberia are two recent success stories that should set the tone for the other conflicts that continue to affect the continent. We reiterate our belief that the solution to those conflicts will depend upon fully understanding them and working together to find solutions to achieve inclusive development. We remain deeply concerned about the situation in Mali, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. I would like to pay tribute to the Blue Helmets who lost their lives in those countries and in other United Nations missions. Spain has established strong links with the countries of the Sahel. We want them to view Spain as a close and supportive country, on which they can depend upon to combat terrorism and humanitarian crises, such as the crisis affecting the Lake Chad basin region. We are following with concern the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call for respect for constitutional provisions, and dialogue in the quest for agreements on which coexistence is based. Similarly, we call on the Burundian authorities to act responsibly and with respect for constitutional legality. The international community has invested considerable resources in support of Afghanistan since 2001 and, in the past year, has reiterated its commitment to the country. Spain believes that it is essential to safeguard the promise of an Afghan society that is free of extremism and terrorism and respectful of human rights, including the rights of women and children. The nuclear and ballistic proliferation programmes of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea are one of the main threats to international peace. The resumption of tests is a blatant challenge to Security Council resolutions and seriously undermines the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, to which Spain is firmly committed. We reiterate our call to the authorities of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to abandon a path that leads inexorably to the countryâ??s political and economic isolation and to genuinely opt for substantive negotiations for the complete, irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Latin America and the Caribbean are undergoing profound changes to their institutions and are seeking new integration mechanisms. In that regard, we consider that the Pacific Alliance is a successful model of political and economic cooperation and that its dialogue with the Southern Common Market will lead to a promising future for the region. Spain welcomes the peace agreement reached in Colombia. We would like to contribute actively to the consolidation of that peace. We participated in the United Nations Mission in Colombia to oversee the laying down of weapons. We welcome the progress made in that process, and we are open to taking part in the new United Nations Verification Mission, which, from 26 September, will be tasked with verifying the reintegration of the contingents of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. In addition, we also support the consolidation of the peace process with development actions taken at the bilateral, European and multilateral levels. We also welcome the prospects for the cessation of hostilities with the EjÃ©rcito de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional, and we offer our assistance in that endeavour. Spain also has fraternal ties to Venezuela. We therefore fervently hope that Venezuelans can once again live in democracy, peace and freedom. We urge the Government, within the framework of ongoing regional efforts, to engage in genuine dialogue with the opposition, respectful of the constitutional framework, the separation and integrity of powers and of human rights. That dialogue should lead to the release of all political prisoners, the holding of free and transparent elections and the end of the humanitarian crisis. That will restore a voice to the Venezuelan people. My country will spare no effort to make that possible. Spain supports the difficult but necessary work of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) to strengthen the rule of law in the country. It encourages continued cooperation between the Guatemalan authorities and CICIG. We hope that the recent misunderstandings between the two entities can be overcome through dialogue and understanding. CICIG is an important instrument for supporting Guatemala in its quest for governance, the proper functioning of its institutions, prosperity, and the well- being of the Guatemalan people and their contribution to Central American integration. The development and stabilization of Haiti are also a major objective for Spain. My country has participated in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti since its inception. We will continue to support the work of the United Nations in the new phase initiated by Security Council resolution 2350 (2017). The rule of law at the international level cannot allow the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity of States to be violated. The annexation of Crimea is a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and is an outright breach of international law. It is regrettable that such an event occurred in twenty- first century Europe. We are also concerned about the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, whose resolution requires compliance with the Minsk agreements. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine deserves our full support. The European Union is one of the most admirable legal and political structures to have emerged since the Second World War. It has brought about unprecedented peace and prosperity in Europe. The United Kingdomâ??s decision to leave the European Union saddens us, but we will work to conclude the negotiations on the new relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union with an agreement that preserves the close and fruitful links between them. In the context of Brexit, Spain has made a generous proposal to resolve the Gibraltar issue. It combines the unwavering claim of Spanish sovereignty over the colony with a statute that benefits the Rockâ??s inhabitants, so that they may continue to enjoy the advantages of European Union membership. We invite the United Kingdom to negotiate an agreement based on those premises, putting an end to an anachronism that is completely outlandish given the excellent relationship between our two countries. We must not allow more time to pass without fulfilling the United Nations mandate calling on us to negotiate the Gibraltar issue. The Hispano-Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, â??It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.â?? We have no choice but to dare to face, together and with determination, the problems that afflict us. With commitment, perseverance and humility we can make great progress. The road is long and does not allow for delays. Let us make the fulfilment of the San Francisco Charterâ??s aspirations for peace, sustainable development and human rights the imperative goal that guides our work during this session.",1,196
7756,Session 72 - 2017,EST_72_2017.txt,EST_72_2017,72,2017,EST,"Our world is unpredictable, and much of that unpredictability is the result of climate change. Climate change could be counterbalanced by rapid changes in our wasteful way of life, aided by technology. Clearly, although technological development â?? especially as it is illustrated by the rapidly developing digital technologies to which billions now have access â?? has a positive potential for transformation, it actually adds to the difficulties of understanding our future. This new world offers opportunities. Unfortunately, it also enhances the risks. To take advantage of the former and manage the latter, we need to take flexible and quick action, and on the global stage. Estonia, a nation of just over 1 million inhabitants, is sensitive to the fact that those who are inherently weak â?? the poor, the disabled and the very young or very old â?? find it especially hard to cope with unpredictability. It is hard for those who have been rendered weak by discrimination, which is often the case for women and ethnic and religious minorities. Estonia itself has gone through a rapid transformation during the more than quarter century that has passed since it regained independence. As our economic and social statistics prove, we have done quite well in protecting our societyâ??s weaker groups, while rapidly adapting and growing our economy. We know it can be done. We suffered for a long time from the international communityâ??s Hobbesian conviction that liberty could about bring chaos, and that bad leadership is better than no leadership. Our guiding principles have therefore been those of John Locke â?? the rule of law, checks and balances and individual rights. Notably, Locke had originally agreed with Hobbes, but changed his mind while on a diplomatic mission observing civil society in Brandenburg, where, as he described it, differing ideas had the right to quietly coexist. That debate has continued into modern times. We know how to offer our know-how on empathic, inclusive development at the global discussion table. Estonia is seeking election to the Security Council for the period from 2020 to 2021. As a small State that was occupied for 50 years of its 100-year history, Estonia is sensitive to the concerns of all States and people who lack the capacity to withstand global tides. Too many States in the world are suffering from unresolved conflicts, and they are States that could take care of their own peoples and contribute at the global level if we could more quickly manage the conflicts that are holding them back or, worse, threatening to tear them apart. The ongoing military aggression in eastern Ukraine continues to stir up conflict and cause casualties among civilians, including the loss of a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europeâ??s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. The Crimean peninsula is still occupied, as are parts of Georgia. There are protracted conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh. Many countries have been torn apart by tensions that we recognized but could not dissipate in time to avoid the worst. The world has lost half a million people in Syria. Estonia supports the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. We cannot overlook the escalating suffering of the people of Yemen, or ignore the fate of the Rohingya people. We must put more effort into humanitarian action to combat the hunger, diseases and epidemics looming in various countries. Our common efforts to combat famine and hunger will also be crucial in South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria. Not every State is mobilizing its resources, efforts and technological advances for the benefit of its people. North Korea is an acute threat to world peace. There are also considerable risks to global stability that are no longer linked to any specific State. The risk of terrorism is metastatic. Spawned initially by the disappointments and disillusionment of people from failed and failing States, it has spread globally. The key to successfully countering terrorism and violent extremism lies in our cooperation at all levels â?? national, regional and global. The Secretary- Generalâ??s initiative to restructure the counter-terrorism architecture at the United Nations will render global efforts more coordinated and transparent. Effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are mutually reinforcing, not conflicting, goals. What I have just mentioned â?? and which has already been exacerbated by the real effects of climate change and, unfortunately, will be even more so in the future â?? has led to the highest number of displaced people the world has ever seen. As with all global challenges, the United Nations is the natural entity for working out and agreeing on a solution. Last year, we adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. We must address the root causes and drivers of irregular migration in order to improve border management and fight human trafficking, while also facilitating opportunities for legal migration. I would like to emphasize that the underlying basic values of our joint endeavours are humanism and solidarity. For Estonia, the importance of empathy for refugees who are fleeing the atrocities of war and destruction is a bitter lesson from our own history, when occupations and the Second World War dispersed our people around the world. If we want to deal with the root causes of migration, we must tackle climate change, which has become the defining issue of our time. Joint efforts to combat climate change on a global scale would not be possible without the coordinating role of the United Nations and the platform offered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have confidence in the Fiji presidencyâ??s ability to achieve concrete results during the twenty-third session of the Parties to the UNFCCC, to be held in November, building on last yearâ??s achievements in Paris. As the response led by society to the threats of climate change shows, big, universal problems can be tackled by inclusive societies. Inclusive societies are fundamental to empathic and inclusive development. However, in recent years we have witnessed a shrinking of the space available to civil society. That trend must be reversed. One of the most prominent guarantees for empathic and inclusive development in democracy and the rule of law is the mainstreaming of gender equality in all areas of life. It is a proven fact that treating women and men equally has a multiplier effect in eradicating poverty. Estoniaâ??s welfare development plan for 2016-2023 covers policy areas from employment and social inclusion to equal opportunities for applying our talents in all walks of life. Our goal is the balanced participation of women and men at all levels of decision-making and management, in both the public and the private sectors. We should also not forget about gender balance in conflict situations. Engaging women in the early stages of prevention, crisis resolution and peacebuilding helps to reduce the probability of a relapse into violent conflict. We should therefore encourage womenâ??s participation in peace processes and acknowledge them as actors of change with great potential. And we must be tireless in implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions on women and peace and security at every level. The Peacebuilding Commissionâ??s adoption of a gender strategy last year was a major milestone on that road. If women are to fully play their role in society, it is crucial to eliminate gender-based violence. We should ensure that its survivors are treated with dignity and that its perpetrators are held accountable for their crimes. Estonia continues to support actions that address gender- based violence and the reproductive-health needs of women and adolescent girls who are particularly vulnerable â?? for example, via the United Nations Population Fund in Ukraine and by supporting the #shedecides initiative. I am convinced that Secretary- General Guterresâ?? commendable effort to bring more women into United Nations decision-making will also be an inspiration to women globally, and have a tangible effect on United Nations policy development, making it more empathic and inclusive. Today, the use of information technology and the Internet is part of the everyday lives of people everywhere. Estonia can share its experience on how best to utilize e-governance to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals more efficiently and cheaply. We have been organizing an event series at the United Nations with the aim of introducing the well-established benefits of our e-governance to the international community, and we sincerely hope that they will lead to concrete action and partnerships. Moreover, this summer, Estonia and Singapore launched the Group of Friends on e-Governance and Cybersecurity. The Groupâ??s aim is to raise awareness, share best practices and promote capacity-building, at a time when such topics are becoming increasingly important at the United Nations level. Digital change is everywhere. Its biggest effect right now is its ability to make geography obsolete. Attacks via cyberspace know no limits. Friendships and partnerships formed in the cybersphere know no borders. Globally, all these things diminish the distance between us. A digitally enhanced global civil society functions better if States provide their people with safe ways to communicate digitally. In the analogue world, it is easy to identify ourselves even to people we do not know, because States have provided us with passports. We need similar identification for the cybersphere, and yet too few Governments provide the means for safe identification. They should catch up and ensure that their people are protected and able to conduct transactions and communicate safely online. Our greater dependence on electronic services has brought greater vulnerability in cyberspace, but that does not mean that we can, or should try, to stop digital progress. We should continue our efforts to analyse how international law applies to the use of information and communications technology, particularly with regard to the principle of due diligence, countermeasures, the potential application of the right to self-defence and international humanitarian law. I call on all States that have not yet done so to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. I would also like to underline the statement of the Freedom Online Coalition, expressing deep concern about the growing trend in intentional State-sponsored disruptions both of access to information online and its dissemination. No one should be denied the right to peaceful assembly or to freedom of association, opinion or expression, whether in real life or online. In order to address all of those challenges successfully, we need a strong United Nations. Estonia welcomes the Secretary-Generalâ??s agenda for United Nations reform and strongly supports efforts to link reform of the United Nations peace and security architecture with reform of its development system. We welcome the emphasis on conflict prevention and peacebuilding, which renders societies resilient to vulnerabilities. Estoniaâ??s chairmanship of the Second Committee is firmly guided by the principles of inclusivity and empathy. It is in our common interests to ensure that the Second Committee tackles the global challenges that fall under its remit. We count on membersâ?? good faith in achieving that. As a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, Estonia has been working closely with a number of countries to improve the working methods of the Security Council, and the functioning of the United Nations as a whole. We need empathy and inclusivity, including in the Security Council. That is why Estonians hope that our first-time candidature for a non-permanent member seat for the period 2020-2021 will be successful. We regained independence 26 years ago, but we already have 22 years of participation in United Nations peacekeeping under our belt. As a small country, we care for all those who are vulnerable in the world. As a digital society, we are a story of hope and of rapid transformation from a poor country recovering from occupation to one that is able to provide for its own citizens and contribute to multilateral cooperation. Again, as a digital State, we consider transparency and being close to people as obligations of a State. We are adamant supporters of rules-based decision-making and clarity of process. We are with those who want to make the United Nations more nimble in order to face the challenges of the twenty-first century.",1,196
7757,Session 72 - 2017,ETH_72_2017.txt,ETH_72_2017,72,2017,ETH," I would like to join other delegations in congratulating the President on his election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and I wish to assure him of the support and cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of his responsibilities through the course of the session. Let me also take this opportunity to express appreciation to his predecessor, who effectively guided the work of the General Assembly at its previous session. We welcome the appointment of Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres as the new Secretary-General and support his call for a surge in diplomacy for peace in addressing the many crisis situations that the world is facing today. Let me stress here we are behind the Secretary-General in his efforts to reform the Organization in the three interrelated areas of development, peace and security, and management. It has been indeed a great pleasure and honour for Ethiopia to preside over the work of the Security Council during this important month, when world leaders gather in New York for the new session of the General Assembly to discuss issues of global peace, security and development. We would like to express our gratitude to all the delegations that participated in the high-level open debate of the Security Council on Wednesday, 20 September, on the reform of United Nations peacekeeping operations (see S/PV.8051). As a leading troop-contributing country, Ethiopia attaches great importance to strengthening the role of United Nations peacekeeping in addressing challenges to international peace and security. In that regard, we welcome the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 2378 (2017), which we introduced on Wednesday, and we thank all delegations that sponsored the resolution, which reaffirms the central role of United Nations peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools available to the world in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security. That the world is facing unprecedented challenges to its peace and prosperity has been all too apparent for quite some time now. Geopolitical tensions reminiscent of the Cold War are increasing. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is posing a real threat to global peace and security. Terrorism and violent extremism continue to wreak havoc across various parts of the world. Global income inequality is no longer just a development challenge; it is also a security threat. Climate change is not a fiction but real, and we are witnessing its devastating consequences for humankind and the planet. Countries such as my own continue to face that horrendous challenge to their development. Three major peace and security reviews were conducted only two years ago, providing valuable recommendations, which, if implemented, could help the United Nations keep pace with the changing global security dynamics and respond effectively to new and emerging peace and security challenges in a comprehensive, systematic and coordinated manner. The clear conclusion of the three major reviews was that the primary United Nations approach to resolving conflicts should be a political one. Indeed, the many conflict and crisis situations around the world cannot be resolved other than through political means. That holds true not only for the crisis in South Sudan, close to my country, but also for the conflicts that are raging in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, as well as the dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula. It is therefore only by reaffirming our commitments to the letter and spirit of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, on the pacific settlement of disputes, that we can effectively respond to the global peace and security challenges we are facing today. However, that is obviously easier said than done. That is because without the political will and commitment of the conflicting parties to finding a political solution through dialogue and negotiation, peace is bound to elude us. A common purpose and resolve on the part of all external actors involved in the search for a political solution to conflict and crisis situations are also absolutely vital. What current global security requires is a stronger and more effective global and regional partnership in the service of conflict prevention and peace. What we have repeatedly seen is that in the absence of that partnership, which must be underpinned by the principles of complementarity and coherence, no meaningful progress can be achieved. The United Nations should be able to play a leading role in forging those kinds of partnerships and in sharing the burden in accordance with the Charter. The links connecting peace, security and development have long been recognized, and that was also the other clear key message emanating from the three major peace and security reviews. More peaceful and inclusive societies generate an environment conducive to sustainable development, and sustainable peace is both an enabler and an outcome of sustainable development. The year 2015 was indeed seminal in that regard. The commitment that we made in this Hall to the transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to inclusiveness, leaving no one behind, was the result of our shared conviction that our fates and futures are linked and that poverty is a shared challenge. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were further reinforced by the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which entered into force last November, thereby strengthening the global response to the threats posed by that phenomenon. Today, however, it is no longer the time to celebrate those achievements; we need rather to reflect where we are in terms of their implementation. Though the SDGs were endorsed by all with much optimism, the current state of affairs is far from reassuring. The global situation since their adoption has not been conducive to ensuring their reasonably effective implementation. That is a major disappointment for all those who have been hoping to see renewed global partnership in the spirit of the 2030 Agenda. For our part, we have fully embraced and begun to record encouraging initial results in implementing the 2030 Agenda. We have continued to invest in our people so as to improve their well-being. In order to achieve structural transformation and diversify our economy, the Government is expanding our manufacturing sector and infrastructure facilities, which have continued to attract an increasing amount of domestic and foreign investments. In order to finance our ambitious national projects, we are mobilizing domestic resources while maximizing the positive impacts of foreign assistance. By implementing integrated, pro-poor policies, we have been reducing poverty and enhancing the quality of life, and we have sustained our rapid and inclusive economic growth. Ethiopia is therefore projected to be the fastest growing economy in the world by the end of 2017. That should, of course, not be a source of complacency; it should rather drive us further to redouble our determination and endeavours to accelerate the full implementation of our current national development policy, which integrates the SDGs, and we will remain fully committed to realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, to responding to the legitimate development demands of our people and to addressing our multifaceted development challenges. That is not easy, nor are our challenges uncomplicated, most particularly those related to natural phenomena. We in Ethiopia, like many other countries, are dealing almost every day with the adverse effects of climate change. Now is not the time, therefore, to doubt their devastating impact, while millions of our fellow humans are losing their lives and their hard- won development achievements. That is happening all over the world. It is high time to act urgently and decisively to combat the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly its disproportionately bad effect on the most vulnerable countries, which, as has been repeatedly pointed out, bear almost no responsibility for causing climate change. Climate change, not just poverty, is our major challenge. The current climate-induced drought is affecting millions of people. For the third consecutive year, after successfully dealing with the El NiÃ±o-induced drought in 2015, Ethiopia is confronting the adverse effects of climate change. That is why I said earlier that climate change is real and poses a clear danger for humankind, because it undermines development gains. We are doing everything that we can to mitigate its negative effects, with the continuing and much appreciated support of our bilateral and multilateral partners. While we are committed to addressing our current humanitarian emergency, we will also continue to implement our national strategy to build a green and resilient economy. Countries such as Ethiopia that are fully committed to implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda require an international environment that can help them succeed in their fight against poverty. Ending poverty, achieving prosperity for all and preserving our planet are attainable goals. We know that we have the resources and the capabilities to achieve a world free from poverty. We have begun implementing the SDGs, albeit unevenly, but time is of the essence. We must accelerate the process if we are to leave no one behind. That has enormous meaning for peace, security and prosperity as well. Poverty and economies that fail to produce employment opportunities are not fertile ground for peace to grow in and be nurtured.",1,196
7758,Session 72 - 2017,FIN_72_2017.txt,FIN_72_2017,72,2017,FIN,"Our thoughts today are with the people of Mexico and the Caribbean. I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. Finland fully supports your six priorities and we appreciate the focus on people as your mandateâ??s centrepiece. I would also like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. His determination to reform the United Nations is laudable. Transparency, accountability, efficiency and gender balance should be the guiding principles of the United Nations system. I also welcome his focus on conflict prevention, which, when successful, saves lives and financial resources. Finland continues to advocate the use of mediation in conflict resolution, which can prevent conflicts and decrease human suffering. Those who are marginalized must be given a voice in peace processes. Women, children and young people often pay the highest price in conflicts, but they can also help to find a way out of crises. Finland has helped to establish a Nordic network of women mediators that aims to sustain peace through womenâ??s inclusive and meaningful participation in every phase of a peace process. Peacekeeping and special political missions are at the core of the United Nations mandate. With experience of United Nations operations since 1956, Finland supports the Secretary-General in his efforts to reform and make United Nations peacekeeping more effective. Following the pledge we made in 2015, Finland has significantly increased its participation in United Nations police missions. Finnish police officers, including a specialized team for sexual and gender-based violence, are now deployed in seven United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is my firm view that no United Nations peacekeeper or any other United Nations personnel should be associated with misconduct in any shape or form. There must be zero tolerance of sexual exploitation and abuse, and the Secretary-Generalâ??s initiative for a circle of leadership is timely and welcome. In wars, there are no winners, and yet conflicts continue. In 2016, 157,000 lives were lost in violent conflicts globally. There are almost 68 million refugees in the world today. The conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and eastern Ukraine are all examples of untold human suffering, and they are not the only ones. The international community has not succeeded in maintaining peace and security. The grave situation in the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is an urgent concern. The North Korean nuclear-weapon programme is a threat to global peace and must be stopped. The Security Councilâ??s cooperation on North Korea has been successful, and it is important to ensure that unity can prevail. At the same time, North Korea has continued its provocations, and such behaviour cannot be tolerated. Finland, as part of the European Union, stands firmly behind the sanctions and urges everyone to do the same. We will be able to find a solution only through negotiations, and the North Korean Government must participate without preconditions. Nuclear weapons represent a severe threat to humankind. As long as they exist there is a risk of a catastrophe. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the cornerstone of global non-proliferation and the foundation for nuclear disarmament. Finlandâ??s approach to the issue is result- oriented and pragmatic. It is crucial to ensure that the countries possessing nuclear weapons are on board for any negotiations. I call on all nuclear-weapon States and countries possessing such weapons to take concrete action on disarmament as soon as possible. It is also important to ensure that the nuclear deal on Iran is honoured by all parties, and I welcome the recent talks on strategic stability between the United States and the Russian Federation. We hope that they will re-start the arms-control talks in Europe and globally. We must also pay closer attention to other threats, of which I would like to focus on two examples. First, countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism is a shared priority. As a global body, the United Nations is well placed to promote the fight against terrorism. I look forward to the leadership of the new United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism in that area. Secondly, we must take health security more seriously. Diseases travel across borders rapidly and synthetic biology is an emerging threat. We need better prevention and national preparedness, and a global, multi-partner collaboration. The Global Health Security Agenda is an important forum in this area, and Finland and Australia are co-chairing an alliance in support of health-security capacity-building. We must take action before the next pandemic arrives. Population dynamics are of great importance. Although the most rapid phase of global population growth is receding, in many places populations are still growing. That is particularly the case in some African countries, where the potential exists for a four-fold increase by the end of the century. Growing populations often result in rapid urbanization. Cities offer people many possibilities, and urbanizationâ??s positive potential is huge. But if it is mismanaged it can also increase rootlessness, hopelessness and even radicalization. One antidote is to ensure that all individuals can reach their potential. Economic opportunities and human rights are vital. People must have a positive stake in their own societies. That will require dedicated efforts to empower individuals, including ensuring their access to education and basic services. Gender equality is a key priority in Finnish foreign policy. As a HeForShe IMPACT Champion, I attach great personal importance to this. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health and ensuring sexual rights and comprehensive sexuality education for all are key factors in sustainable development. As a candidate for the UNESCO Executive Board, Finland also considers gender equality, high-quality education and fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to be priorities. Climate change binds the South and the North together. None of us will be spared its destructive effects. Besides the direct environmental impact, it affects security and is a cause of forced migration. The rapid implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement is even more urgent than it was a year ago. The Agreement has a clear goal â?? keeping rising temperatures below 2Â°C. At the moment we are not on that path, and we must speed up our efforts, because the window for action is closing. Our transition from fossil fuels to renewables and energy efficiency must be much faster than what we are seeing right now. Everyoneâ??s efforts are needed. The Arctic is at the forefront of climate change. It is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. If we lose it, we will lose the whole world. We must find effective ways to slow down the warming of the Arctic. One of those is reducing emissions of black carbon and methane and their impact on the Arctic. The sources of black carbon are well known and solutions exist. What we need is shared willingness and determined steps to deal with the issue. The emissions should be reduced in the Arctic area first and foremost, but global action is also needed, as much of the black carbon is transported in from outside the area. I firmly believe that tackling this issue will be a genuine win-win for 17-29389 3/27 the whole of humankind. Finland currently chairs the Arctic Council, and combating climate change is one of our priorities. Finland celebrates 100 years of independence this year, and the theme of our centennial is â??Togetherâ??. Since our independence began, Finland has supported and respected the rules-based international order. In our interconnected world, promoting national interests also requires international efforts. I strongly believe that global challenges and threats must be addressed not by individual action alone but by the international community. Peace and security, human rights and development belong to all of us. Only together can we make this world a better place.",1,196
7759,Session 72 - 2017,FJI_72_2017.txt,FJI_72_2017,72,2017,FJI,"I want to begin by congratulating Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session and by wishing him every success in the upcoming year. As we all know, the global community faces a great number of challenges, of which climate change is only one. But I am sure that we all want to send a message of solidarity and sympathy tonight to the millions of people in the Caribbean who are suffering from the ravages of Hurricane Maria. It is an especially cruel ordeal so soon after Hurricane Irma paved a path of destruction through the Caribbean and the southern part of the United States. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected. The Fijian people share a special sense of solidarity with those who have lost either loved ones or their homes and possessions in such events. Last year, we lost 44 of our own people and a third of our gross domestic product when Fiji was struck by the biggest cyclone in its history. So, as the incoming President of the twenty- third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-23), I am deeply conscious of the need to lead a global response to the underlying causes of such events. The appalling suffering in the Caribbean and the United States reminds us all that there is no time to waste. I would also like to pay tribute to the new Presidentâ??s predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, the first Fijian to occupy the presidency of the General Assembly. Ambassador Thomson carried out his role with great distinction, and I especially want to thank him for the role he has played in bringing the parlous state of our oceans to global attention. The Ocean Conference that Fiji co-hosted with Sweden in June was an unqualified success. As a global community, we have begun the massive task of restoring the health of our oceans and tackling the overfishing that is stripping them of marine life and depriving millions of people of a precious resource, now and in the future. I salute the United Nations for appointing Ambassador Thomson as Special Envoy for the Ocean. It is an honour for Fiji to have one of our own leading an effort that is so vital to ensuring the implementation of a crucial Sustainable Development Goal. Next year will mark the fortieth anniversary of Fijiâ??s contribution to United Nations peacekeeping. As a small nation, we have suffered a great deal of pain from the loss of some of our finest troops on peacekeeping duties over the years. But our contribution is a very important part of how we see ourselves as a nation, with our men and women in uniform serving the global community by protecting ordinary people in troubled parts of the world. For 40 years, we have helped make the world more secure. And now we are determined to make a successful contribution to the wider security of the planet through our leadership of COP-23. There is no escaping the fact that climate change is as great a threat to global security as any conflict. Millions of people are already on the move because of drought and the changes to agriculture that threaten their food security. History has taught us that human beings will always fight over access to water. Unless we tackle the underlying causes of climate change, we already know that some places will become unlivable 17-29407 23/29 and others will disappear altogether. In my own region, three of our neighbours are at risk, which is why Fiji has offered to give refuge to the people of Kiribati and Tuvalu in the event of a worst-case scenario in which their homes sink beneath the waves. For the Fijian people, climate change is real. It affects our lives in every way. The entire villages that we are moving out of the way of rising seas, the loss of our ancestral burial grounds, the salinity affecting our crops and the constant threat of destruction to homes and infrastructure of the kind that we experienced last year are all evidence of that. The reason that our hearts go out to the people of the Caribbean right now is not only because we can empathize with them but because we fear the same fate. I implore the nations of the world to imagine a third of their gross domestic product being destroyed in the space of a year or so. Imagine another cyclone scoring a direct hit and wiping out decades of development. It is clear that global warming changes our very understanding of what our national interests are. It challenges us to understand that the only way for every nation to put itself first is to lock arms with every other nation and move forward together. Anything else is self-destructive for the world and for each nation. It may be tempting for political leaders to show that they are protecting some national industry or near- term economic goal, but we must ask at what cost. Wise leaders must work hard to convince their peoples to embrace the path that we know that we must take. There is no choice to be made between prosperity and a healthy climate, for how prosperous can we be if we must devote our resources to relocating entire populations or reinforcing major cities? How much does it cost to find new places to farm? What will the consequences be for global and regional security if nations begin to compete for safe land or have conflicts over the movements of climate refugees? It is obvious that we need to cooperate. We need to learn from each other and use the worldâ??s considerable resources to do the greatest possible amount of good for the greatest possible number of people. We need to continue to create prosperity and ensure the well-being of the nations and ecosystems of the world. If we view the process as some sort of negotiation in which each country tries to preserve its narrow national interests, we will all lose. We will be powerless to protect our own people from the consequences of climate change. Collective action is the only way forward. Wise men and women will understand that. That is why I took on the role of President of COP- 23 and why I have eagerly embraced the opportunity to be the first Pacific Islander to do so. It is about ensuring that my own people flourish and prosper, now and in the future. By collaborating with the other nations of the world through the process, we will ensure that together, humankind can flourish and prosper. Morocco will pass the ball to me and the Fijian team in Bonn in November, and we thank the Moroccan presidency of COP-22 for making such great strides towards the goal of fully implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Next year, Fiji will pass the ball to Poland. I want to assure the Polish presidency of COP-24 that Fiji will be supporting it throughout the entire process. Our own presidency would not be possible without Germanyâ??s wonderful assistance. We simply could not have staged an event of such size and complexity in Fiji. Out of necessity, we have forged a bond with Germany that is an example to the world of how countries at opposite ends of the Earth and of vastly different means and size can work effectively for a common goal. We did it with Sweden at the Ocean Conference in June, and we are equally proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Germany to deliver on the goals that the Paris Agreement has outlined. Fiji is deeply conscious that Governments alone cannot overcome the challenge at hand. That is why we are placing such emphasis on the notion of a grand coalition of Governments at every level with civil society, the private sector and ordinary citizens moving the agenda forward. I am reaching out to governors, mayors and leaders of every sort across our societies, people of faith, people on the front line in the climate struggle, women and the young people who represent our future. We are going to do things differently in Bonn. The formal proceedings will be led by our chief negotiator, Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan, and I will play a roving role. I will be on hand to resolve any difficulties that arise in the formal negotiations. In order to reflect the importance of our grand coalition, I will be travelling between the two zones in Bonn, that of the formal negotiations and the climate action zone, along with my good friend and our climate champion, Mr. Inia Seruiratu, as well as my fellow Pacific leaders. I am counting on them to help me get the message across that only by working together can we move the process faster and further. In the climate action zone â?? the Bonn zone â?? Fiji and Germany are bringing together all those who have a part to play in making our grand coalition a great transformation, including climate activists, companies at the cutting edge of technology, artists, creative people, dancers and performers. We will be stamping the zone with the Fijian bula spirit of optimism and inclusiveness that has made our islands famous throughout the world. In the formal Bula zone, we want the nations of the world to embrace what we in Fiji and some other Pacific countries call the spirit of talanoa, characterized by dialogue based on trust, empathy and the collective good. In our experience, it is the best way of getting things done, especially in difficult circumstances. It embodies engagement that is respectful, honest and cooperative and acknowledges that none of us, no matter how powerful, can solve the climate challenge on our own. For humankind to survive, flourish and prosper, we have no alternative but to cooperate. We have already established a solid foundation for our efforts in the presidency. The formal negotiations are progressing, and we are looking forward to welcoming ministers and their delegations and representatives of civil society to Fiji next month for our pre-COP meeting. We are already delighted to see the energy and sense of purpose of the leaders in our grand coalition. I am especially grateful to Governor Jerry Brown of California, whom I have appointed to help me as Special Envoy for States and Regions and who heads an impressive list of political leaders around the world who are part of the Under2 Coalition. As we all know, the Paris Agreement calls for global warming to be kept well under 2Â°C above the average temperature of the industrial age and as close as possible to 1.5Â°C. A year ago I stood here, before my appointment as President of COP-23, and called for 1.5Â°C to be our target (see A/71/PV.8). I meant it then and I mean it now. Fixing that number as our objective is urgent, and we must do it as soon as possible. I certainly carry with me the authority of the Pacific to pursue that objective, and at this point I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to a Pacific islander whom we have just lost but whose legacy will live on in these negotiations. Two years ago, Tony deBrum of the Marshall Islands took a very powerful slogan to Paris â?? â??One point five to stay aliveâ??. We intend to honour Tonyâ??s legacy, and I intend to draw on his spirit during my presidency. In addition to ensuring decisive action to limit global warming, we must also do a lot more to make nations and communities more resilient where the effects of climate change are concerned. We know that we are all going to have to adapt. But we must make special provision for those who are most vulnerable and have the fewest resources for coping with the catastrophic consequences we are witnessing all around us. We are pleased to be part of a serious engagement with Governments and the private sector aimed at securing innovative and more affordable access to insurance so that those affected by disasters can recover more quickly. It is a question of fairness and economic development, because without insurance, many nations and communities find restoration and rebuilding simply too great a burden. We are also encouraged by the rapid development of clean, affordable alternative-energy solutions for countries across the world, which offers great promise that we can achieve the 1.5Â°C target and prosper. I have no doubt that the role that I have embraced as COP-23 President is the most important ever undertaken by a Fijian leader. I appeal to my fellow Pacific leaders to support me as we tackle the greatest challenge that our region and the world have ever seen. I want to acknowledge the work of the past 30 years of the Alliance of Small Island States, which has consistently looked after the interests of our peoples and reminded the world that our interests are the interests of every global citizen. We are all in the same canoe, which is why we will have a Fijian ocean-going canoe â?? a na drua â?? in the main hall in Bonn to remind everyone of the need to fill its sails with the collective determination to move this process forward and deliver on the promise we made to each other in Paris. To all the nations that have yet to ratify the Paris Agreement, I say, please do so. I appeal to the nations of the world and to all the leaders of the grand coalition for their support. I draw my power as COP President from them and I will do everything in my power to use it wisely.",1,196
7760,Session 72 - 2017,FRA_72_2017.txt,FRA_72_2017,72,2017,FRA,"I am privileged to address the General Assembly, and I know to whom I owe this privilege. I owe it to all those who, just over 70 years ago, rose up against a barbaric regime that had seized my country, France. I owe it to the nations that heard the cry of those who resisted and that from the Americas, Africa, Oceania and Asia sent their sons and daughters to France to help. Not all of them were familiar with France, but they knew that Franceâ??s defeat would also mean the defeat of the ideals they shared. They were proud of those ideals and were prepared to die to uphold them. They knew that their freedom and values were dependent upon the freedom of other men and other women living thousands of kilometres from them. I owe the privilege to those who, once the war had ended, dared to attempt reconciliation and built a new international order. I owe it to people who, like RenÃ© Cassin, understood that human rights were at the very core of international legitimacy. I owe it to people who brought the guilty to justice, tended to the victims and rectified mistakes. I owe it to those who believed that the values that the war had trampled must be restored to their rightful place. Tolerance, freedom and humanity are the values on which the United Nations was built. And it was not because those values were beautiful but rather because they were just and made it possible to avoid the worst. I do not speak of all this merely to talk about history, but because today I hear several of our colleagues talking about the future of our world, and forgetting somewhat where we have come from. What might seem exotic and far removed from our immediate interests is perhaps what determines and will determine most what lies ahead for us. My country might have a unique place in the international order, but that means that it is also indebted to all those whose voices have gone unheard. I know that the duty of France is to speak for those whose voices are not heard. If we speak for them, we also speak for ourselves â?? now and for the future. Today I would like to speak for those forgotten voices. I have heard Bana, who lives in Aleppo and whose voice I want to bring here. She has lived under the horror of bombings, of police and militia. She has lived in refugee camps. The Syrian people have suffered enough for the international community to acknowledge its collective failure and to question its methods. To achieve just and lasting peace, we must focus urgently on a political settlement to the crisis by way of a transition, as the Security Council has called for through its unanimous adoption of resolution 2254 (2015). France and its partners have taken the initiative to support the efforts of the United Nations and to design, finally, an inclusive political road map for Syria. That is why I hope that we can establish a contact group made up of all of the five permanent members of the Security Council and relevant stakeholders. The so-called Astana process can be useful, but it is not enough, and the past few days have revealed many problems. We have to give ourselves the resources we really need to begin negotiations, because the solution will ultimately be a political rather than a military one. It is in the interests of all of us and, of course, in Syriansâ?? interests above all. In that context, I have already stated what our two red lines are. First, France will not waver where the use of chemical weapons is concerned. The perpetrators of the attack of 4 April must be brought to international justice, and that must never happen again. Secondly, it is absolutely crucial to ensure access to health care for all men and women and enable medical facilities to protect civilians. France will make this one of the priorities of its presidency of the Security Council next month. When we act to achieve peace in Syria we are acting for the Syrian people, but we are also doing it to protect all of us against Islamist terrorism, because what we are primarily fighting in Syria and in Iraq is terrorism. We are acting for all who perished in attacks in recent months, because jihadi terrorism has struck our fellow citizens across all continents, regardless of religion. We must therefore protect ourselves by joining forces, and security must become our first priority. That is the focus of the initiatives that France has launched for combating terroristsâ?? use of the Internet and all their financing sources. That is why I hope we can organize a conference in 2018 on this effort, which I urge everyone here to become involved in. It is also the focus of the military action that France has undertaken as part of the coalition in Syria and Iraq, in accordance with international law. We are fighting terrorism not only on the military and diplomatic fronts but on the educational, cultural and moral fronts, too. It is part of our efforts in Asia as well as in the Middle East and Africa. And it must bring all of us together. I have listened to Ousman, a schoolboy in Gao, and I would like to bring his voice in here today. Ousman is growing up in Mali under constant threat from indiscriminate attacks, and yet his only dream is to be able to go to school without risking his life. We are now all engaged in the Sahel â?? the United Nations, the countries of the region that are participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel, and the European Union and its member States. And I would like to pay tribute to all stakeholders by acknowledging that it is an extremely difficult challenge with a high cost in human lives. Our challenge there is, again, eliminating terrorism and, in order to do that, building national capacities so that States can take charge of their security themselves. Regardless of the resources we put there, our collective effort will not succeed if the countries that are most affected are unable to take on their own responsibilities in that regard. That is why I have supported the deployment of the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel since my first day in office, and I urge everyone here to mobilize collectively to that end, too. This is also why I want to invest in strengthening our support to African peacekeeping missions, because that is the future. We must all give new thought to the links between peacekeeping, regional organizations and host countries. Our capacity to respond to our peoplesâ?? aspirations for peace depends on it. Certainly, a military response can never be the only response. Here I would like to emphasize the importance of a political response, and in that regard I have in mind the implementation of the Algiers Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and our development policy. I have also listened to KouamÃ©, and I want to bring his voice in here today. Left on the roadside, he crossed Africa before putting his fate in the hands of smugglers in Libya. He crossed the Mediterranean and came safely to port when so many others perished at sea. The refugee, the displaced person and the person to whom we give the sad name of migrant has truly become the symbol of our age, of a world where we will never be able to halt the march of despair if we cannot turn the roads of necessity into roads of liberty. Such migrations are the result of politics, climate change or ethnic conflict. They are always the roads taken by necessity. Today necessity is a flight from the persecution of which the Rohingya â?? more than 400,000 refugees, most of them children â?? are victims. The military operations there must cease, access to humanitarian aid must be provided and the rule of law must be re-established because, as we know, what is going on is ethnic cleansing. France will take the initiative on this issue in the Security Council. Necessity means leaving to save oneâ??s family when war is raging and when international humanitarian law is no longer respected but becomes a tool to be exploited in the warring partiesâ?? strategy of violence, as it is in Syria. It means exile when the defenders of freedom are the first to be targeted by the powers that be. Protecting refugees is a moral and political duty and one in which France is resolved to play its part, by supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees wherever he has to intervene; by opening legal paths to resettlement in areas closest to the conflict zones in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey as well as in the Niger and Chad; and by defending the right to asylum and unequivocal respect for the Geneva Conventions. In Paris on 28 August, we brought together the African and European countries that have been most directly affected by the migration flows along the central Mediterranean route. We adopted a road map whose priority is combating the smugglers who traffic in despair. We must put an end to these intolerable violations of fundamental human rights by working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration to establish a humanitarian infrastructure and by helping countries of origin and transit to better control migration flows. But while short-term responses are a necessity for managing crises when we are dealing with terrorism and migration, what is at stake today is our ability to muster the political will to address the underlying causes of these sources of instability. Migration and terrorism represent the biggest political challenges that all of us may ever face. If we are to overcome such moral and civilizational challenges, it will be by pursuing a true policy of development, which is why I have decided that France should play its part by devoting 0.55 per cent of national revenue to public development aid for the next five years. I am grateful for the applause, but I have to temper it somewhat â?? first, because I know that some people were expecting more, that such aid is never enough, and that Franceâ??s response is still not enough, but mainly because it is not money that is the real issue; it is how effectively that money is used. It is what we spend the money on. It is about how we can be better at evaluating and taking responsibility for the money that we all contribute. Of course, I want France to do its part with development aid, but what I really want is for us to bring more innovation and intelligence to our aid, using different methods and taking on greater responsibility on the ground. That is what I want. The challenge we have today is in ensuring that development aid actually reaches the areas where it is needed, simply and efficiently, calculated correctly and for the purpose it was designed for. That was what we wanted to do with the Alliance for the Sahel, for example, which we launched with the European Union, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme. We also have to set clear priorities. The first is investing in education, because it is education that will help us win the fight against the obscurantism that is bringing down entire countries and regions today, both in Africa and the Middle East. I urge the international community to step up in February 2018 in Dakar when we re-establish the World Partnership for Education, which France will co-chair with Senegal. This is a key struggle for us all. We must give girls and boys the opportunity to escape obscurantism and to choose their own future, not the future imposed upon them or the one that we in this Hall would choose for them. Our second priority is to invest in health and combat major pandemics and malnutrition, because without education or health there can be no hope. In this fight for development, we must also support the role of women, culture and freedom of expression. Wherever the role of women is undermined, there, too, development is undermined, as is a societyâ??s ability to assume its rightful place in the world. These are not trivial issues; this is a deep-seated civilizational struggle. It is our struggle and these are our values, which are not relative but universal on all continents and at all latitudes. Wherever culture is undermined, there, too, our collective ability to rise to challenges is undermined. That is why UNESCO is today such an important organization and has such a key role to play with respect to ensuring a human face for the world at a time when widespread obscurantism seeks to eradicate its unbelievable diversity. We are fighting so that all cultures and languages can be preserved and so that progress can continue to be made. Freedom of expression, too, is a most urgent issue. The United Nations must protect the freedom of those who think, reflect and express themselves, in particular the freedom of the press. For that reason, I call for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the protection of journalists throughout the world; neither the fight against terrorism nor the more demanding world we are living in can justify any inroads upon that freedom. Finally, I wish to speak on behalf of my fellow Frenchman Jules, who lives on the island of St. Martin. I am thinking of his house, which lies in ruins, and of his fear that this may happen again because of climate change, which is leading to an increasing number of disasters. The future of the world is that of our planet, which is now taking revenge for the folly of humankind. Nature is calling us to task to shoulder our responsibility of humanity and solidarity. It will not negotiate with us, and humankind must defend itself by protecting it. Extreme weather events are exploding the traditional differences between the North and the South. The most fragile are always the principal victims, swept up in a whirlwind of injustice. We are all affected by climatic changes, from China to the Caribbean, in Russia and in the Horn of Africa. My country promised, before the Assembly, that we would achieve a universal agreement in Paris. That we did and signed it in this very Hall. That agreement is not up for renegotiation. It binds us and rallies us together. To take it apart would mean unraveling a pact not just between States but also between generations. It can be improved; we can have new contributions and fresh input, but we will not backtrack. I fully respect the decision of the United States. The door will always be open to it. However, we will continue our work, along with all Governments, local governments, cities, businesses, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world. We have the strength of pioneers, endurance and the certainty and energy of those who wish to build a better world. That better world will lead to innovation and job creation, despite the beliefs of those who see the future only in terms of the past. We will build such a world right now by making our national contributions, as France has done by adopting its climate plan, which places us on the road to carbon neutrality. On 12 December, we will be meeting in Paris with those who wish to move forward with real solutions by mobilizing public and private funding. Here I confirm that France will play its full role in this respect by allocating â?¬5 billion per year to climate action between now and 2020. Our unfolding ambition is reflected in the fact that this very afternoon we will be introducing a global pact for the environment aimed at shaping international law for the coming century, with the support of the United Nations agencies. At a time when some would wish us to stop, we must continue to advance, because climate change and extreme weather events will not stop. Our duty of solidarity and humanity will continue. Behind every one of our decisions are the voices and lives of the invisible masses whom we must defend, because we in turn were defended in the past. Why do we not heed those voices? Why are we not focusing on what 70 years ago gave humankind the strength to believe in itself: planetary responsibility, the desire for mutual assistance and faith in progress? When I speak of Bana, Ousman, KouamÃ© and Jules, I speak about all my compatriots and everyone elseâ??s compatriots, because our security is their security. We are inextricably linked in a community of fate, today and tomorrow. Global balances have changed radically in recent years and the world has become multipolar once again, so we must learn anew the complexity of dialogue as well as the riches it can bring to us. Our collective action is coming up against obstacles stemming from State instability. In Libya, six years after the military intervention there, I acknowledge, before the Assembly, Franceâ??s particular responsibility to ensure that the country regains its stability. The meeting held in La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 25 July enabled us to make progress on the reconciliation necessary for the success of the political process under the auspices of the United Nations. Together with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, we must succeed in 2018 in organizing elections that will mark the restoration of effective State authority. I will do my utmost to achieve that. Concerning Venezuela, collective action must enable the upholding of democracy and respect for all political movements. We must give no ground to the dictatorial trends that we see today. In Ukraine, too, we must tirelessly work to ensure the upholding of the commitments undertaken, bring about an effective ceasefire and work together with our partners, particularly Germany, to ensure that the parties to the conflict respect international law and end the conflict. Multilateralism is facing the challenge of nuclear proliferation, unable to ward off threats that we believed to be past but that have re-emerged today. Pyongyang has crossed a major threshold in terms of military escalation. This is an urgent, collective existential threat. North Korea has not to date given any sign of wishing to negotiate. Its authorities are determined to raise the stakes. Our responsibility, together with all of our partners, including China and Russia, is, through resolve, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table for a political settlement to this conflict. France rejects escalation and will not close any door to dialogue, provided that the conditions are met for such a dialogue to promote peace. It is that same goal that impels me to defend the nuclear agreement with Iran. Our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation enabled us to reach a solid, robust and verifiable agreement on 14 July 2015 and to ensure that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons. To denounce that now without proposing anything in its place would be a serious mistake, and failing to uphold it would be irresponsible, because it is a helpful agreement that is vital to keeping the peace at a time when the risk of a collapse into a death spiral is genuine. That is what I told the United States and Iran yesterday. For my part, I hope that we will be able to fulfil the agreement, by working to contain Iranâ??s ballistic activity and manage the situation after 2020, which the 2015 agreement does not cover. Let us by all means be more demanding, but certainly not by unwinding the results that previous agreements have already achieved. Look at the mess we are in today. Has the lack of dialogue done anything to contain the situation in North Korea for even a moment? What I want for all of us is a world where dialogue, controls and multilateralism provide us with effective, useful weapons. I do not know whether, 70 years from now, a future successor of mine will have the privilege of addressing the Assembly. Will multilateralism survive the time of doubt and change that we are going through? The fact is that we should be remembering the state that the world was in 70 years ago, shattered by war and stunned by genocides. Right now we need to rediscover the optimism, ambition and courage with which we met those reasons to doubt and the faith in what unites us. We must restore our trust in the universal founding principles of the United Nations, which protect all of us and guarantee our dignity, all over the world. But why have we ended up where we are? Because we have allowed the idea to take root that multilateralism is a kind of convenient game for diplomats around a table, a tool of the weak. That has gone on for years, because we let ourselves believe that our efforts were stronger and more convincing when we acted unilaterally. But it is not true. Because, sometimes out of cynicism, we let ourselves believe that multilateralism could not fix everything, and so we let deregulation of the world take over. We have been slow to address climate change and the new inequalities that unregulated capitalism creates. We have let the voices of discord shout the loudest. And in that game, the loudest voices win. Time and fading memory have made us forget the history that moulded us and allowed the belief to take root that we are stronger without multilateralism. The challenge that our generation faces today is to be able to get our faith back and to show that in todayâ??s world, nothing is more effective than multilateralism. And why? Because every one of our challenges is global â?? terrorism, immigration, climate change, the regulation of the digital world. They all have to be addressed multilaterally and on a global scale. Every time we turn away from multilateralism, the loudest voice wins. But it is only through multilateralism that we can achieve our vision of the world, because it is universal, not regional. Every time we give up on an idea â?? for example, that the situation of women concerns some people in parts of the world but not others, or that equality is an issue for one civilization but not others â?? we are abandoning the universality of the values that have brought us together in this Organization. In some countries we have already ceded the race to the strong. And that is because, every time, the great Powers, seated around the Security Council table, have ceded the race to the strong and to unilateralism, and have failed to live up to agreements they signed themselves. They have failed to uphold the glue that keeps multilateralism together â?? the rule of law. That is what has got us this far and can build sustainable peace. Today we need multilateralism more than ever, not because it is a comforting notion, and not because it is somewhere for thinking people to take shelter, but because it is about the rule of law, about interaction between peoples and about equality for us all. It is what will enable us to achieve peace and overcome our challenges. And the United Nations is indeed the Organization that can act in full legitimacy to preserve global equilibrium. That is why I want a more responsible, effective and agile United Nations, and why I fully support the Secretary-Generalâ??s plans for the Organization and his ambition and commitment to making it equal to the challenges facing our world. We need to get out of our offices and away from meetings with States and Governments and to seek new resources, so that we can see the world as it really is and reconsider some of the dogmas to which we have sometimes clung. We need a Security Council that can make effective decisions, without walling itself off through its right to the veto when mass atrocities are being committed. We need better representation for everyone here and for every continent. We need to coordinate crisis management better with the European Union, the African Union and the key subregional organizations. That is why France will stand beside the United Nations as it implements reform. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is only in a stronghold such as this that the forgotten voices that I wanted to bring here today can be heard, a stronghold where there is a place for everyone and where everyone can be heard even by those who do not wish to hear. To them I say that a refusal to listen to the oppressed, to victims, allows their miseries to grow and prosper until the day when they overwhelm all the rest of us as well. A refusal to listen means forgetting that at one time or another in our history, we were the oppressed, and others heard our voices. It means forgetting that our safety and security is theirs too, that their lives are connected to ours, and we cannot remain unscathed in a world that is going up in flames. A refusal to listen to those who call for help means believing that walls and borders will protect us. But it is not walls that protect us, it is our willingness to act and to change the course of history and our refusal to allow history to be written without us even as we imagine we are safe. It is our sovereignty and our sovereign use of force in the service of progress that protects us. A nationâ??s independence lies in its interdependence. A refusal to listen to those voices would mean believing that their despair is not ours, that we will always enjoy benefits that they can only dream of. But what if those benefits are our whole planet â?? what if they are peace, justice and freedom? Do we believe that we are the only ones who should enjoy them, tucked away in some corner? If we do not defend those shared benefits, we will all be doomed. We will be watching fires burn that history will blow back on our own children tomorrow. Today, more than ever, those shared benefits, our common goods, represent our shared interests. Our security is their security, and there are no sides, no division between those who believe in the rule of law and multilateralism and those who believe in a pragmatic unilateralism. That is a false notion. Our real effectiveness is playing out in this struggle right here. That is why I want to join with everyone here today, united in a belief in a strong, responsible multilateralism. That is our generationâ??s responsibility, if we do not want to abandon ourselves to fatalism. There is only one kind of courage we need, which is to listen to those voices and not to deviate from the mark we wish to leave on history. We must be constantly aware that we must work to reconcile our interests and our values. Our security is the common good of our planet. Our generation has no choice. It must speak for today and for tomorrow.",1,196
7761,Session 72 - 2017,FSM_72_2017.txt,FSM_72_2017,72,2017,FSM,"Let me at the outset congratulate you, Sir, on assuming your role as President of the General Assembly. I also congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for a job well done over the past year. I must also mention the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres. Since assuming the leadership of the Organization a few months ago, he has already shown himself to be more than equal to the tremendous tasks associated with his high office. As we gather here today in this great Hall, natural disasters and calamities are striking in many parts of our world. Hurricanes, typhoons and earthquakes have devastated communities and displaced thousands of people in just the past few days. To the victims and their families around the world, I offer our sympathies and condolences on behalf of the Government and the people of the Federated States of Micronesia. We condemn terrorist attacks, which have taken innocent lives. Micronesia pledges its resolve to stand united against terrorism, in solidarity with affected nations. On behalf of the Micronesian Government and its people, I offer our deepest condolences to all those nations and families that have suffered losses at the hands of terrorists. As we witness current record-breaking megastorms, we cannot ignore their connection to climate change, especially to ocean warming and sea-level rise. In the wake of those devastating events, we must not only stay committed to our collective fight against climate change, but we must also redouble our efforts. Climate change is one of the most serious threats to global peace and security, endangering the very existence of our islands. It needs to be at the top of the agenda of the General Assembly. As the United Nations undertakes efforts to reorient its work around the priorities of peace and prevention, the United Nations system will have to adapt. We reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative on climate change and security. Climate change mitigation is also essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the eradication of poverty, ending hunger, building resilient infrastructure and shared prosperity. Without progress in fighting climate change, our sustainable development efforts will be futile. That is particularly true for small island developing States. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has provided an avenue to enhance cooperation in our fight against climate change, and the world must seize the moment. Micronesia expresses grave concern that some countries have chosen to break with the international community and neglect the Paris Agreement, against the best scientific advice. As a small island developing nation at the forefront of the battle, Micronesia calls on all States to fully engage in global efforts to implement the Paris Agreement, support the Green Climate Fund and access thereto, and contribute innovative climate solutions. I would like to share with the Assembly a story of global cooperation at its finest. This is a story of a treaty that was designed to save the ozone layer and succeeded, but it has also made major contributions to climate-change mitigation. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is considered the most successful multilateral environmental treaty of all time. That is why the 194 parties to the Protocol met last year in Kigali and agreed to amend the Protocol and expand its scope. Specifically, the Kigali Amendment allows the Protocol to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are chemicals used in refrigeration and air conditioning that can contribute significantly to global warming. Phasing down the use of HFCs will help prevent 0.5Â°C of global temperature rise, and complementary energy-efficiency measures in the same sector could help avoid another 0.5Â°C of warming. We thank the parties to the Montreal Protocol that have already ratified the Kigali Amendment, totalling eight out of the 20 needed for the Agreement to enter into force. We call on other parties to ratify the Agreement as soon as possible, ideally before the next Meeting of the Parties, in Canada in November. Along with the Paris Agreement, the Kigali Amendment is a major step towards the survival of small island States. As the story of the Kigali Amendment demonstrates, with intelligence, perseverance and cooperation, we can achieve anything. That is the motivation that keeps us all working together for a better future. In the islands we say the ocean is us, as we are the ocean. As an island nation, Micronesia fully supported and participated actively in the United Nations Ocean Conference in June. The Call for Action from the Conference, entitled â??Our Ocean, Our Future,â?? highlights the actions required to achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 14. Micronesia supports the intention to organize a second United Nations Ocean Conference, in 2020, which will enable us to follow up on the commitments made at the first Conference and to assess our progress towards the full implementation of SDG 14 by 2030. We look forward to the work of the Special Envoy for the Ocean to maintain the momentum. At the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in Samoa, our leaders endorsed the Blue Pacific identity as the core driver of collective action in the Pacific region. That was a fitting progression from last yearâ??s Pohnpei Oceans Statement, as elements of the Blue Pacific narrative reinforce the potential for shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean. We must now show ambition in tackling the mounting threats to the health of our ocean. The special case of small island developing States must be enshrined in the forthcoming implementing agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We welcome the successful conclusion of the meetings of the Preparatory Committee, and now we must urgently launch and conclude the intergovernmental conference to draft and adopt a new legally binding agreement. For Pacific islands, fisheries are a mainstay of our economies, our most important renewable natural resource and an integral part of our sustainable development plans. Effective conservation and management of our tuna resource is important not only for us who depend on it for our livelihoods and sustainable development, but also for addressing global food-security concerns. We must remain steadfast in our efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in all its forms. I want to take this opportunity to express our concerns about the lack of recognition of, and respect for, the rights of coastal States such as Micronesia to manage fisheries in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs). In the Western and Central Pacific, some developed-country fishing nations are advocating for flag-based rights in regional fisheries management organizations. Such measures would undermine existing zone-based management measures and erode the ability of small island developing States, as resource owners, to exercise their sovereign rights under international law. That would not be an acceptable outcome. Therefore, we call on those developed-country partners to withdraw all such proposals and to actively support the efforts of small island developing States to increase benefits from the sustainable management of fisheries in their EEZs. Allow me to briefly thank the Secretary-General for his proposals on the peace and security architecture, management reform and other reform processes for the Organization. We commend his proposals, which will result in a more transparent, efficient and effective regime that is able to respond to the challenges our world is facing today. The United Nations must be fit for purpose. While reforms are vital to any organization, they must not disadvantage small island developing States; they must leave no one behind. For many years now, my country has also paid priority attention to the efforts by Member States to reform the Security Council, but those efforts have resulted in little progress. We need to break out of this cycle. It is high time to shift to real negotiations. In the Western Pacific, and especially in our greater Micronesian region, the provocative and aggressive actions by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea pose a threat to regional security and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Micronesia supports the actions taken by the Security Council. We call on the Council and on countries with the power and influence to help resolve the crisis to take action immediately to ensure that peace is achieved on the Korean peninsula. We gather in this great Hall and debate among nations, but we are speaking for our peoples. We are trying to advance their interests. We are seeking to improve their lives. As history has taught us, we will fail our nations and our peoples unless we work together for the common good. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development constitutes a people-centred approach. Consistent with that principle, the theme of this session of the General Assembly is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. We must believe in such a future and move towards it together. Multilateralism and the United Nations are more important than ever. Only together can we restore and maintain peace and security. Only together can we overcome the threat of global climate change. Only together can we build a sustainable future for our planet and all of our peoples.",1,196
7762,Session 72 - 2017,GAB_72_2017.txt,GAB_72_2017,72,2017,GAB,"At the outset, let me congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I wish to assure him of Gabonâ??s support in his fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to him. I also commend the valuable work of his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson. It is a privilege for me to convey my warm congratulations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres. I believe firmly that his rich and long experience is a valuable asset to our Organization, and I welcome his special emphasis on conflict prevention in his inaugural speech. The theme of the general debate of this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, lies at the very heart of our priorities. It reminds us all of the place that the human individual must occupy in our respective actions and of our obligation to reconcile development and durable peace with the preservation of the environment for present and future generations. It is up to us all to act to fashion a human species for whom a decent life for all will be self-evident. Along with security, peace is an essential prerequisite for the development of Africa, including my country of Gabon. In that connection, Africa continues to occupy the lionâ??s share of the Security Councilâ??s agenda, and my country therefore endorses the African position in favour of a permanent seat for Africa on the Council. Inasmuch as peace is essential at the international level, peace and security at the national level are the basic ingredients for development and for the participation of all in the democratic debate. Gabon is a country that bears the stamp of peace, and we want to remain the haven of fraternity and solidarity that we have always been. That is why, at the beginning of the year, I convened a political dialogue to which I invited all of the nationâ??s most prominent persons. Everyone who participated in the dialogue was able to candidly discuss all of our countryâ??s important issues and desired reforms. We reached compromises that were difficult but also dynamic and necessary â?? on the voting system, electoral procedures and the organization of powers. Moreover, the implementation of the conclusions of the political dialogue has already begun, with the recent formation of a new Government that includes representatives from the opposition and civil society. With the adoption first of the Millennium Development Goals and, subsequently, of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Organization is continuing its efforts to mobilize the international community in order to offer humankind a decent life on a preserved planet. Beyond such declarations, however, if we are to achieve the SDGs, the time has come to give the Organization the resources it needs to carry out its work through predictable and sustained financing. As for Gabon, the new Government is operating under a framework entitled â??Emerging Gabon 2025: a vision, a strategy, a road mapâ??, aimed at achieving sustainable development and diversifying the national economy. That approach, which seeks to reduce the countryâ??s dependence on extractive industries and dampen the volatility of raw-material prices, is already taking shape through an industrial base that is creating jobs and wealth, the Nkok special economic zone. Gabon has not been spared from the crisis that has affected our entire planet and that has been reflected in an economic slowdown that has had a negative impact on employment, particularly for young people. In response, we have adopted an economic recovery programme aimed at providing new economic momentum through measures that adjust the budget, develop infrastructure and encourage the private sector to leverage our economyâ??s diversification and transformation. Nevertheless, my Government is striving to offer the people of Gabon better living conditions through a number of measures, ranging from reducing the prices of food staples to building new hospitals. I have also initiated an equal-opportunity programme that will enable all Gabonese people to enjoy the same resources as they embark on a path of personal and collective fulfilment. To that end, I have placed womenâ??s empowerment at the heart of the Governmentâ??s agenda. The future of our planet will depend on our determination to honour the commitments that we undertook in the Paris Agreement during the twenty- first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We do not have the right to disappoint our peoples at this historic moment, because the challenges posed by global warming are not simply environmental in nature â?? they are also political, economic and security challenges. We have even less right to disappoint our peoples, given that the reality that we may wish to ignore calls attention to itself every day with increasingly brutal force, in the form of all the recent environmental disasters. I would like to take this opportunity to express the condolences and moral support of the people of Gabon to the countries that have been victims of the recent hurricanes and cyclones, as well as the victims of the earthquake in Mexico. Gabon will not deviate from its path. Our public policies will continue to be aimed at managing our resources responsibly and sustainably. In that spirit, my country has just created 20 marine protected areas in addition to our existing 13 national parks on land. I have also instructed the Government to strengthen its reforestation policy so as to ensure the sustainability of our forests. With regard to my countryâ??s ongoing commitment to those key issues, I have agreed to lead the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change for the next two years, following the term of my Egyptian brother President Al Sisi. I will be responsible for bringing Africaâ??s voice to all climate-change negotiations. At the subregional level, my peers have also appointed me Secretary-General of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). My task will be to spearhead an institutional reform process in that important regional integration body. We are even more determined to ensure economic integration in our subregion because we believe that joint development is needed in order to deal with the fluctuations in the international market. Through its Office in Libreville, ECCAS supports Central Africa in its efforts to deal with the peace and security challenges in the region. In that regard, member countries have confirmed their firm determination to fight the beast of terrorism in all its forms regardless of its motivation. To that end, the subregional counter-terrorism strategy for Central Africa, which was recently endorsed in YaoundÃ© and is in line with the African Union counter-terrorism strategy, translates our commitment to eradicating that scourge through concrete steps. I take this opportunity to commend the upcoming holding of a joint summit of ECCAS and the Economic Community of West African States on counter-terrorism, which I have always hoped to see happen and which was encouraged by Security Council resolution 2349 (2017). I also commend the initiative taken by the countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel to establish a subregional force to effectively combat terrorism and all other threats to peace and security. Combating terrorism is a multifaceted and long- term struggle that requires cooperation among States and solidarity with the victims of such barbarism. The response cannot be exclusively military. I therefore call for the implementation of the relevant provisions of resolution 2199 (2015) in order to reduce the sources of financing for these criminal networks. In addition to terrorism, another serious threat to many countries, including mine, is poaching. In that regard, my country has sponsored an important resolution aimed at pooling our efforts to contain the problem, which decimates our flora and fauna and encourages instability in a number of regions, particularly in Africa. Speedy implementation of the recommendations put forward in the resolution is essential and should guide us in seeking the proper balance between the protection of nature and the survival of local populations, who are actually the main victims of poaching. Among the worrying current situations in Africa, that in the Central African Republic requires our sustained attention. Gabon continues to have a presence in that brother country as part of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. I call on our various partners to support the action plan developed by ECCAS and the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, as well as the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. Similarly, the arms embargo must be lifted for the legal and legitimate Government of the Central African Republic exclusively, so that it can restore security and its authority throughout the national territory. The resilience and defiance of the negative forces that are ravaging the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic and other parts of the Central African subregion derive their strength from the illegal exploitation of underground natural resources and wildlife. International measures designed to combat the illegal trade in such resources must be properly enforced if we wish to defeat the armed groups that continue to carry out such criminal activities. Working to foster peace also requires eliminating weapons of mass destruction by implementing the relevant international instruments. Some parts of the Middle East have been the focus of the serious threats to international peace and security caused by the nebulous terrorist organization known as the Islamic State, which is exacerbating instability in Syria and Iraq. In that connection, we must address the question of Palestine, which remains a thorn in the side of the international community. In my view, the resumption of direct talks between the two sides remains the only way to reach a solution. I commend the efforts by the United States and France to push for a resumption of the peace process. Similarly, we have noted the recent events on the Korean peninsula and remain firmly committed to peace and stability in that part of the world. We call for strict compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions in that regard. Another major human tragedy unfolding before our eyes is the situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar. In the twenty-first century it is simply unacceptable that men, women and children are being killed or forced to flee their country for the mere fact that they belong to a particular religious community. The Assemblyâ??s universal conscience cannot and must not accept that. Finally, and in connection with international solidarity and justice, lifting the embargo that has plagued Cuba for several decades is only fair. Our Organization is blowing out its seventy- second candle. Its universal vocation has been firmly established. I am confident that, with our collective determination, it will be able to overcome the current multifaceted challenges to peace and security in the world. That is why prioritizing human beings by ensuring peace and a decent life for all on a protected planet is no longer a simple ambition but a collective duty.",1,196
7763,Session 72 - 2017,GBR_72_2017.txt,GBR_72_2017,72,2017,GBR,"I would like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Mexico following the devastating earthquake. I also want to reiterate my sympathies to those affected by the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean. Our thoughts are with them all at this time. As we meet at the General Assembly, we face challenges that go right to the heart of who we are as nations â?? challenges that test our values, our vision and our resolve to defend the rules and standards that underpin the security and prosperity of our fellow citizens. As I argued in my speech here last year, many of those challenges do not recognize or respect geographical boundaries. I think, of course, of the terrorism that has struck so many of our countries â?? including my own, five times this year â??and, fuelling that terrorist threat, of the increasing numbers being drawn to extremist ideologies, not only in places riven by conflict and instability but many online in their homes, thousands of miles away from those conflicts. I think of climate change, which is depleting and degrading the planet we leave to our children. And I think of the vast challenges that come from the mass displacement of people. Many are refugees fleeing conflict and persecution. Others are economic migrants prepared to risk everything on perilous sea crossings in the desperate search for a better life for themselves and their children. Through that migration we also see the challenges of economic inequality, between countries and within them. That inequality, together with weaknesses in the global trading system, threatens to undermine support for the forces of liberalism and free trade that have done so much to propel global growth, and it is pushing some countries towards protectionism in the belief that that best defends the interests of their own people. As the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by States deliberately flouting, for their own gain, the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security â?? the unforgivable use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against its own people and, perhaps foremost in our minds today, the outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons by North Korea and a threat to use them. I believe that the only way for us to respond to that vast array of challenges is to come together and defend the international order that we have worked so hard to create and the values by which we stand. For it is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause among nations to act together in our shared interests and form the multilateral system. It is that rules-based system that we have developed â?? including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris Climate Agreement, and laws and conventions like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons â?? that enables a global cooperation through which we can protect those values. Indeed, the defining purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations are to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations, to achieve international cooperation in solving the problems of an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian character, and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends. I do not see those as vaunted ideals to be held to their own sake. Those values and the rules they imbue are central to our national interest, to our security and prosperity. The international system, with the United Nations at its heart, is the amplifying force that enables countries to cooperate and live up to those standards in word, spirit and deed, to our collective and individual benefit. If the system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples. Those of us who hold true to our shared values, who hold true to that desire to defend the rules and high standards that have shaped and protected the world we live in, need to strive harder than ever to show that institutions like the United Nations can work for the countries that formed them and for the people who we represent. That means reforming the United Nations and the wider international system so it can prove its worth in helping us to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. It also means ensuring that those who flout the rules and spirit of our international system are held to account, that nations honour their responsibilities and play their part in upholding and renewing a rules- based international order that can deliver prosperity and security for us all. First, we must insure that our multilateral institutions can deliver the aspirations on which they were founded. Think of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees looking after those who have been driven out of their homes; the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons striving for a world free of chemical weapons; the United Nations Childrenâ??s Fund helping children in danger. Those are all vital missions where the United Nations surely has a unique role to play. That is why the United Kingdom has over 70 years been such a pioneering supporter of those organizations, and more. But we should also acknowledge that throughout its history the United Nations has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery. When the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the United Nations and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of States as Members and donors. Even more important, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely on the Blue Helmets, who rely on that sign I stand in front of today to come to their aid in the darkest of hours. We must begin by supporting the ambitious reform agenda that Secretary-General Guterres is now leading to create a more agile, transparent and joined-up Organization. Much of the work will be practical and unglamorous. It will require the United Nations to deliver better cooperation on the ground between agencies, remove competition for funding and improve gender equality. But it will also require real leadership to confront damaging issues that have beset the United Nations. I therefore welcome the Secretary- Generalâ??s new circle of leadership on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, and I am pleased to be part of that initiative. We, the nations of the United Nations, need to give the Secretary-General our backing for those reforms. As an outward-looking, global Britain and the second-biggest funder of the United Nations, the United Kingdom will remain committed to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on development and humanitarian support. We will use our military to support peacekeeping, and our diplomats will continue to work to tackle conflict and to support peacebuilding. In turn, the United Nations and its agencies must win our trust by proving to us and the people we represent that they can deliver. That is why we will remain generous in our funding but will set aside 30 per cent to be paid only to those parts of the United Nations that achieve sufficient results. But this is about more than technical reforms, important as they are. It is also about reforms that enable the United Nations to truly respond to the global challenges of the twenty-first century. At last yearâ??s General Assembly we undertook to do far more to resolve the challenges of refugee and migration flows. We agreed to develop global compacts to address the causes and the consequences of the mass movements of people we see today. That was an important step to elevate significantly our global response and enable us collectively to tackle this challenge of our times. In the year ahead, as well as agreeing the principles of those compacts, we must ensure they can be applied in practice. We must do more to identify, protect and support refugees and those hosting them near conflicts. On migration, our starting point must be that it can benefit both countries and migrants themselves, but only when it is safe, orderly, well managed and legal. If we do not manage that effectively, we will fail both our own citizens and those taking those dangerous journeys, and we will push more people into the curse of modern slavery at the hands of the human traffickers and organized criminal groups that drive that inhuman industry. But the steps we are agreeing through these compacts alone will not be enough. For if people cannot find jobs, opportunity and hope for themselves and their families where they live, they will continue to look elsewhere. As the United Nations and as Members, we must work harder to combine the efforts of our development programmes with the private sector and the international financial institutions to support the creation of jobs and livelihoods that will address not just the consequences but the causes of this great challenge of our time. The truth is that, despite our best efforts, we are not succeeding. We must do more. The same is true with terrorism, where again, the challenges we face today are vastly different from those of previous eras. When terrorists struck London and Manchester this year the world saw our cities come together in defiance. Our Parliament carries on. Ariana Grande came back to Manchester and sang again. London Bridge is bustling with people. Our communities came together at the Finsbury Park mosque in North London, and Londoners got back on the Tube. The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life. But defiance alone is not enough. As leaders, we have all visited too many hospitals and seen too many innocent people murdered in our countries. In the past decade, hundreds of thousands have been killed by terrorists across the world. That is a truly global tragedy that is increasingly touching the lives of us all. This year is the tenth anniversary of the death of the woman who introduced me to my husband and who was known well to many of us in the United Nations. Benazir Bhutto was brutally murdered by people who actively rejected the values that all of us here in the United Nations stand for, in a country that has suffered more than most at the hands of terrorists. She was murdered for standing up for democracy, murdered for espousing tolerance and murdered for being a woman. When I think of the hundreds of thousands of victims of terrorism in countries across the world, I think of their friends, their families, their communities, devastated by that evil, and I say, enough is enough. Of course, we must continue to take the fight to these terrorist groups on the battlefield. The United Kingdom will remain at the forefront of that effort, while also helping to build the capabilities of our alliances and our partners to better take on this challenge. 24/29 17-29395 We must also step up our efforts as never before to tackle the terrorist use of the Internet, for as the threat from terrorists evolves, so must our cooperation. That is why today, for the first time in the United Nations, Governments and industry through the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism will be coming together to do just that. Tech companies have made significant progress on that issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online and to increase significantly their efforts to stop it being uploaded in the first place. That is a major step in reclaiming the Internet from those who would use it to do us harm. But ultimately it is not just the terrorists themselves who we need to defeat, it is the extremist ideologies that fuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, sow division and undermine our common humanity. We must be far more robust in identifying those ideologies and defeating them across all parts of our societies. As I said in the aftermath of the attack on London Bridge this summer, we have to face the fact that this will require some difficult conversations. We all need to come together, to take on that extremism that lives among us and to nurture the common values that must ultimately win out. They are the values of the United Nations. And yet, despite our best efforts, we as nations and as a United Nations have not found the ways or the means to truly take on that threat. That is why today, as I talk about United Nations reform, I ask the Secretary-General to make the fight against terrorists and the ideologies that drive them a core part of his agenda, at the heart of our development, peacebuilding and conflict-prevention work. To give that effort the prominence it surely requires, I am calling on the Secretary-General to make that a theme of next yearâ??s General Assembly and use it to harness the efforts of Governments, the private sector and civil society so that we can truly strike the generational blow against that vile evil in our world. As we do so, we must clearly strike the balance between protecting our people and protecting their freedoms. We must always guard against those who would use the fight against terrorism as a cover for oppression and the violation of human rights. As we look at the situation in northern Burma, I call on the Burmese authorities to put an end to the violence, allow humanitarian access and fully implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. By reforming our multinational institutions, we can strengthen their ability to deliver for the people we serve, protect the vulnerable and fight injustice. We can enable multilateralism to multiply the effect of our individual commitments through its convening power and spending power, through the economies of scale it can bring, the standards it can set, the moral leadership it can harness and the legitimacy it can confer. But multilateralism can only reflect the values that individual States project and can only multiply the commitments that they are prepared to make. It is strong nations that form strong institutions and that provide the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that brings stability to our world. It falls to us all to decide whether we will honour the responsibilities that we have to one another. I have talked about the role of the United Nations in stepping up on counter-terrorism. But that is an area that we as States have critical responsibilities that the United Nations cannot itself address alone, for it is inescapable that the terrorism, conflict and instability that we see across the world are in many cases driven by the actions of States acting through proxies. When countries back groups like Hizbullah to increase instability and conflict across the Middle East, support so-called separatists in Ukraine to create instability on Europeâ??s eastern borders, or give tacit support to criminal groups launching cyberattacks against our countries and institutions, they call into question the very rules and the international system that protect us. That is why, both globally but also in our own continent of Europe, the United Kingdom will remain steadfast in our commitment and responsibility to ensure the security and stability of our friends and allies as we have done for generations. Just as it the responsibility of nations not to seek to advance their interests through terrorist or proxy groups, so it is also the responsibility of each of us to act together in the face of the most egregious violations of our common rules and standards. Clearly, responsibility for the chaos and tragedy that we see in Syria lies firmly at the door of Al-Assad. He and his backers have continually frustrated the efforts of the United Nations to act as the broker of peace through the Geneva process. As responsible States, we must not abandon our support for the United Nations attempts to secure peace and stability in Syria. Indeed, we must continue to call on all those with influence on the regime to bring them to the table. But in recent weeks, the United Nations has also confirmed what we all knew, namely, that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on its own people. In the face of that fact, we have a responsibility to stand up, to hold the Syrian regime to account. That responsibility sits with us all, but a particular, special responsibility lies on the shoulders of the permanent members of the Security Council. As one of those five members, the United Kingdom takes our special responsibility seriously. I am proud that we have used the full weight of our diplomacy to ensure that we have not had to exercise our veto in a generation. We seek to foster international cooperation, not frustrate it. But others have not done so. One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the past five years as in the whole of the second half of the Cold War. In doing so they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons. As a result, in Syria, the United Nations has been blocked. That has undermined the values that we hold dear and the international rules-based system that is the basis of security and prosperity around the world. Now we face an even more immediate, global danger in the activities of Kim Jong Un and his regime in the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. Time after time, he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding States, contempt for his neighbours and contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security. On that challenge, the United Nations in recent weeks has shown it can step up to the task, with last Mondayâ??s Security Council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the twenty-first century. We have seen regional and global Powers coming together and, as in the founding Charter, putting aside limited self- interests to show leadership on behalf of the wider world. But despite those efforts, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea continues to defy and provoke the international community and threaten its neighbours. Unless all Security Council members continue to live up to the special responsibilities that are placed upon us and, in seeking to resolve that crisis, to be prepared to take on necessary measures to tackle that threat, we will not be able to bring stability to the Korean peninsula. As the world looks on, I am calling for further steps and for nations with that special responsibility to work together and exert the pressure we know is necessary to force Kim Jong Un to change his ways. Let us not fail this time. Let our message to North Korea be clear: our determination to uphold those rules is stronger by far than their determination to undermine them. Throughout the history of the United Nations, countries have shown time and time again that by being true to our values, rules and standards, it is possible to come together and to deliver in ways that have the most extraordinary impact on the lives of the people we serve. I believe we can do so again. We must do so again, and we will do so again.",1,196
7764,Session 72 - 2017,GEO_72_2017.txt,GEO_72_2017,72,2017,GEO,"At the outset, let me express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that have affected North America over the past several days, including the hurricanes that have devastated Caribbean island nations and parts of the United States and the earthquakes that have impacted Mexico. We convey our solidarity to the Governments and the peoples of those nations during these difficult times. No country, including Georgia, is immune from natural disasters. Solidarity is what strengthens nations when addressing such severe challenges. My fellow countrymen share with me the honour of addressing the General Assembly today, because the message that I have been entrusted to deliver is one that they understand in their bones, having personally experienced it, lived it and embraced it. That message â?? their message â?? is straightforward: by putting Georgian citizens at the centre of our strategy, we aim to further strengthen democratic institutions, ensure peace and accelerate economic growth. Those are the essential multipliers for sustainable development, a project that connects us with the region and the world. This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Georgiaâ??s membership in the United Nations. During that period, we have managed to transform our country from a recipient of United Nations humanitarian aid to a top reformer that was recently elected as Chair of the Open Government Partnership. Georgia brings to that task the same vision that it espouses for itself: putting its citizens at the centre of its priorities. Georgiaâ??s chairship of the Open Government Partnership will support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Goal 16, on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. In implementing the SDGs by incorporating them into our national policies, we have seen the need for the institutional reform of the United Nations, and we support the new vision of Secretary-General Guterres as reflected in the Declaration of Support, to which we recently subscribed. When I spoke before the Assembly last year (see A/71/PV.13), Georgia was heading into This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 (verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org). 17-29597 (E) *1729597* ________________ A/72/PV.14 21/09/2017 general elections. That resulted in our people entrusting us with increased support to lead the country. The people saw two things. First, they saw that we are committed to making democratic rights and security the key drivers of all our policies. Secondly, they saw that we offer a clear path for further reforms. Our citizens feel the changes that international institutions have been clearly referring to. Georgia has advanced in all international rankings over the past five years. The Fraser Institute ranks the Georgian economy as the fifth freest in the world. We have come to grips with corruption. The Heritage Foundation ranked Georgia thirty-first in terms of freedom from corruption in 2017, an improvement from its ranking of sixty-ninth in 2012. Transparency International echoed that progress in 2016 by ranking Georgia first in the region in that regard. We have prioritized the protection of property rights. The World Economic Forumâ??s Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017 has raised Georgiaâ??s ranking by 77 since 2012. We are committed to an independent judiciary. The World Economic Forum ranks Georgia at sixty-third in that regard, an increase in rankings of 28. In the critical area of law enforcement and physical security, the World Bank ranks Georgia twenty-sixth with respect to combating organized crime, an increase in rankings of 41. We are not making merely cosmetic changes. We promised our people that we would introduce a parliamentary system and improve our Constitution so as to conform to the best European standards. In addition to addressing numerous contradictions in the current Constitution, the new draft introduces many new progressive initiatives, such as the right to physical integrity, the rights of persons with disabilities, the right to access to the Internet, environmental protections and many more that are in line with the recommendations of the European Commission for Democracy through Law, also know as the Venice Commission. Those commitments reflect Georgiansâ?? aspirations to attain full membership in the European Union and NATO. Georgians understand that to be their destiny, as Georgia has long been an integral part of Europeâ??s broad cultural and historical tapestry. In parallel with constitutional reform, we began implementing our four-point economic reform plan aimed at ensuring quick economic growth. We launched an ambitious education reform in order to facilitate links between the educational system and industry and develop demand-based higher and professional 2/42 17-29597 education and enhance the economic skills and capacity of the labour force. Living in an innovative society is a key to success for our talented young people. We are further investing in our national ecosystem and in integrating it into the global one so as to open doors and build bridges connecting our innovators with world markets. Prudent macroeconomic policy has been the foundation of our success in the regionâ??s turbulent economic environment. The World Economic Forumâ??s Global Competitiveness Report has advanced Georgia by 97 places in the rankings since 2012. This month, Moodyâ??s upgraded the sovereign credit rating of Georgia to Ba2, acknowledging that Georgia has successfully overcome the regional shock of 2014-2016. In order to increase incentives to invest in Georgia, we have implemented a bold taxation reform, which includes abolishing the profit tax on undistributed earnings and liberalizing the tax administration system. We anticipate up to 5 per cent economic growth this year, rising to 7 per cent and higher in the coming years. We are committed to upgrading Georgiaâ??s infrastructure. That is important in order for Georgia to realize its geostrategic aim of serving as a hub for doing business in the region, connecting East and West. Upgrading our infrastructure is essential so as to ensure the rapid delivery of services, achieve efficiency in tourism and logistics, and effectively take goods to market. We see that as a powerful way to create employment that pulls people out of poverty. We have agreed to a multi-year programme with the International Monetary Fund and have secured financing for projects worth several billion dollars from international financial organizations. Georgia, like Ukraine and Moldova, has signed an Association Agreement with a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement with the European Union (EU) and has secured visa-free travel to the EU. At the same time, Georgia has become the first country in the region to sign a free-trade agreement with China. On the one hand, we are integrating into the EU internal market and, on the other hand, we are bringing Asian markets closer to us. That enables Georgia to use the full potential of its free trade networks as part of one of the most exciting development ventures of our time. We are contributing to the One Belt, One Road project, which will facilitate trade in high-value ________________ 21/09/2017 A/72/PV.14 goods and services between Europe and Asia, cutting significant time from the length of traditional seaborne transport around the peripheries of Eurasia. Asia and Europe will meet in that grand adventure through the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project, which we are implementing together with our Turkish and Azeri partners, and Georgiaâ??s new state-of-the-art port on the Black Sea at Anaklia. That deep-water port will be capable of handling the largest container ships, which will result in a multifold increase of Georgiaâ??s cargo- transit capacity. Anaklia will be developed by multiple international players and will be operated by a well- known American company. Georgia is now less than 10 days from East Asia and within five days of any point in Europe. We are creating an efficient multimodal transit infrastructure that will forge links and processes, and will cement relationships among States and people from Europe to Asia. It represents the fundamental connection between building economic stability for Georgian citizens and achieving a more prosperous and peaceful region. In a world full of challenges â?? hot and frozen conflicts, State and non-State aggressions â?? Georgia is no exception. And here, too, we have put our citizens at the centre of our strategy. United Nations Members are well aware that the Russian Federation continues to occupy two historical regions of Georgiaâ??s sovereign territory in violation of its many international obligations, including dozens of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Since the beginning of 2017, the Russian Federation has intensified its policy of occupation and factual annexation of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia. It has implemented so-called integration treaties and signed so-called agreements with de facto authorities to absorb Georgiaâ??s occupied regions into Russiaâ??s military, political, economic and social systems. It has also accelerated its military build-up in both of the occupied regions of Georgia. The Russian Federation has intensified the fortification of the occupation lines by installing razor-wire fences, trenches, so-called border signs and other artificial barriers. Families have even endured having razor- wire fences cut through their dwellings and farmyards. Vulnerable groups, such as people in need of medical care and schoolchildren crossing to get an education in their native language, which is prohibited in the occupied regions, have been blocked by closed crossing points. Meanwhile, Russia continues to install motion 17-29597 3/42 detectors and other technologies in order to assert full control of all crossings along the occupation line. Georgia is firmly committed to the peaceful resolution of the Russia-Georgia conflict. The Georgian Government complies with the EU-mediated ceasefire agreement. It has many times reaffirmed its adherence to the legally binding non-use of force. Russia has not reciprocated. Georgiaâ??s consistent efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict are reflected in the testimonies of many countries and international organizations. I would like to thank world leaders for addressing the need of accelerating peaceful conflict resolution and for supporting Georgiaâ??s territorial integrity and sovereignty during this general debate. Every year, the General Assembly adopts a resolution reiterating the right of return of all internally displaced persons and refugees to the occupied regions. Georgians are grateful for the support of the United Nations, but the resolutions have not translated into reality for hundreds of thousands of my compatriots waiting to return to their homes, simply because one State Member of the United Nations refuses to comply with its international obligations. The Government of Georgia is providing new instruments to rebuild trust with our compatriots living across the occupation line. We are determined to make the benefits of Georgiaâ??s European agenda available to the people on the other side of occupation line. Our substantial package of initiatives for those under occupation include providing opportunities for trans-administrative borderline trade and access to Georgiaâ??s free trade opportunities in the global marketplace. We also offer them health care, education and other social benefits. Despite the challenges we face, Georgia is a significant contributor to Euro-Atlantic security. Our strategic partnership with the United States has proved to be key for our development and stability, and we are committed to deepening those ties further. The EU Global Strategy has recognized Georgiaâ??s success as a prosperous, peaceful and stable democracy and as a significant contributor in its neighbourhood. We continue our active participation in international operations, including in Afghanistan and in the European crisis-management operations in the Central African Republic and Mali. In 2014, Georgia became a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and joined three counter-ISIS working groups on counter-financing, on counter-messaging and on foreign terrorist fighters. Georgia is a party to 14 United Nations counter- terrorism conventions and to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, and fulfils its commitments in that regard. Georgia is growing. Georgia is vibrant. Georgia is resilient in the face of challenges. Georgia carries its share of international responsibilities. Georgia is all of those things, because Georgia is its citizens. They are at the centre of our Governmentâ??s strategy, and that is where they will remain. As we have reached out to the world, the world has come to us. Our citizens are the beneficiaries of greater connectivity to the world. Their economic success is a prerequisite for sustained well- being and prosperity, both at home and well beyond Georgiaâ??s borders. I speak today as one steward of our nation, with thanks to all who love and support Georgia.",1,196
7765,Session 72 - 2017,GHA_72_2017.txt,GHA_72_2017,72,2017,GHA,"It has been 60 years since my country, Ghana, became a Member of the Organization. We joined when we became independent, some 12 years after the first meeting of the Organization in San Francisco, and Ghana has been an active participant in the United Nations ever since. I want to thank the United Nations for the honour done Ghana by my appointment by the Secretary- General as co-Chair of the advocacy group of eminent persons for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to continue in the position that was held by my predecessor as President, His Excellency Mr. John Dramani Mahama. That mark of trust in Ghanaâ??s leaders is a matter of justifiable pride for the Ghanian people, a trust I pledge to uphold. On 25 September 2015, when the SDGs were adopted, there were sceptics who feared that the Goals were too many and too complex to be successfully tackled, even with concerted effort. The lesson that we have learned from the experience of the Organization, however, is that once the world puts its collective mind to something, the chances are that we will get it right. Every day, something happens to bring home to us, the inhabitants of the planet, that we are in it together. There is no better or more dramatic indication of that truth than the images that have recently dominated our television screens of devastation caused by floods in Houston, Texas; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Mumbai, India; Palpa, Nepal; Dominica, Puerto Rico, Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Martin, all in the Caribbean, and Niamey, in the Niger. One of the most modern cities in the richest, most powerful nation on our Earth suffered the same fate as did Niamey in the Sahel region of Africa, one of the poorest parts of the world. At the height of the raging storms, one thing became clear. It did not matter if you were in the richest or poorest part of the world, the awesome power of nature was on display and we humans came across as the same sad creatures at the mercy of nature. As I watched and listened along with the rest of the world, it occurred to me that taken altogether, the SDGs are indeed a worthy set of Goals for the world. They bear repeating â?? no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequality, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, life below water, life on land, peace, justice and strong institutions, to be achieved through partnerships for the Goals. We should work hard to achieve the Goals; the world will be a much better place. Ghana was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to gain its freedom from colonial rule. This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of its independence, and it is auspicious that I am addressing the Assembly for the first time on the birthday of our historic first President Kwame Nkrumah â?? the day we have set aside to commemorate him. We believe that it is time Africa came of age and held its rightful place on the world stage. Africa will be neither a pawn nor a victim. This Africa will be honest with itself and with the world. It will shed its cloak of poverty and become prosperous. We are under no illusions about the hard work it will take to achieve our stated goals, but we are not afraid of hard work. We know that the critical ingredient in making sustainable economic progress is to ensure a stable, democratic system of Government. I believe that we are making that progress in Ghana. After years of political turmoil and accompanying economic chaos, a consensus has emerged in our Fourth Republic. We have had political stability for the past 25 years and a multiparty democracy in which regular elections are now an accepted feature of our governance. I am here today because of elections last December, in which the people of Ghana voted out an incumbent Government and gave me and my party the mandate and honour to govern our nation for the next four years. We continue to be a beacon of democracy and stability on the continent. Our institutions of State are growing stronger and we have made more progress with our economy than at any time since independence. We are nowhere near where we want to be, but we are determined to realize our potential and make Ghana a prosperous nation. There will always be the adventurous among us Ghanaians who would want to seek challenges in different parts of the world. We wish them well, and expect that wherever they go they will be welcomed and treated with dignity. But we are working to grow our economy and open up opportunities for all our citizens. No longer should Ghanaians feel that they have to subject themselves to the intolerable and inhumane conditions of crossing the Sahara and drowning in the Mediterranean in hopes of making a living in Europe. We have just started the free senior high school programme that aims to guarantee secondary education for all of Ghanaâ??s children. It will ensure that all our children will be educated at least to the secondary level, and that money, or the lack of it, will no longer mean being denied an education. That has already led to an increase of more than 90,000 children entering secondary school in the current academic year who would otherwise have dropped out at by now. Sustainable Development Goal 4, which aims to ensure inclusive, equitable, quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, will be within our reach by the target date. We do not want to be a scar on anybodyâ??s conscience. We want to build an economy that is not dependent on charity and handouts. Long and bitter experience has taught us that no matter how generous the charity, we would remain poor. We want to build a Ghana that looks to the use of its own resources and their proper management as the way to engineer social and economic growth in the country. We want to build an economy that looks past commodities in order to position our country in the global marketplace. We are not rejecting aid, but we do want to discard a mindset of dependency and living on handouts. We want to build a Ghana beyond aid. It is an easier platform on which to build sustainable relationships. In talking about sustainable relations, Africa and, indeed, Ghana are committed to ensuring that we remain a continent free of nuclear weapons. Three weeks ago, highly enriched uranium was flown out of Ghana back to China, signalling the end of the removal of all such material from the country. Our nuclear reactor has since been converted to using low-enriched fuel for power generation. A world free of nuclear weapons is in our collective interest. I wish to reaffirm my countryâ??s commitment to maintaining friendly and cordial relations with all the countries and peoples of the world. Ghanaâ??s full engagement, through the Economic Community of West African States, in the process of West African integration, and through the African Union, in the process of African integration, remains a goal of my Government. Regional and continental integration are in Ghanaâ??s interest, as they represent one of the surest ways of establishing the conditions for prosperity on the continent in the decades ahead. They will also help to ensure security and combat the scourges of terrorism, extremism and intolerance. The conflicts that continue to plague our continent in Libya, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali would be more effectively resolved if the international community were to support and not undermine the efforts of our regional and continental organizations to deal with them. Ghana will also continue to be active in the multilateral organizations to which we belong, such as La Francophonie, the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, because we believe multilateral action and international cooperation are in our common interest. We want to build a Ghana that will enable our people to deal with the rest of the world on an equal playing field. I am saying nothing new when I draw attention to the urgent need to reform the Organization. While it has been talked about and scheduled for a long time, we have somehow never found the courage or the will to reform the United Nations. Ghana supports the process of United Nations reform, especially of the Security Council, as set out in the African Common Position on United Nations reform, based on the Ezulwini Consensus. The time is long overdue to correct the long-standing injustice that the current structure and composition of the Security Council represents for the nations of Africa. We cannot continue to preach democracy and fairness and insist on peace and justice around the world when our global Organization is not seen by the majority of its Member States as having a structure that is just and fair. Indeed, many see it as helping to perpetuate an unfair world order. The Organization provides the best vehicle for the world to manage its many and varied problems, and we would undermine its credibility and fail in our duty if we did not reform the United Nations. Let us not dare to let ourselves and future generations down. The time for reform has come.",1,196
7766,Session 72 - 2017,GIN_72_2017.txt,GIN_72_2017,72,2017,GIN,"It is a great honour for me, as the current Chairman of the African Union, to take the floor in this melting pot of multilateralism to address the Assembly. The theme that unites us is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. It is a topic of particular relevance to the African continent. At the outset, I would like to convey my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I have no doubt with respect to the dynamism that you will imprint on our work in order to build on the work of your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, to whom we pay tribute for having made Africa his priority, thereby bestowing a remarkable impetus to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Africa, once subjugated, enslaved, malleable and marginalized, has awoken. It has risen up to fight for sustainable development, justice and good governance. Today more than ever, Africa is determined to take its destiny into its own hands. It is fully determined to be the main stakeholder in its development and to fully play its role in the management of international affairs. The task will not be easy. However, we have faith because we have the potential and the assets necessary to lift our continent to great heights on the world stage. With that in mind, Africa extends a sincere and friendly hand to all partners of goodwill, conscious of the following principles: that there can exist true happiness only when it is shared; that there can be wealth only when it is equitably distributed; that there can be viable and supportive partnership only when it is equal; that there can be enduring peace only when it is inclusive; that there can be sustainable development only when it respects and consolidates the dignity of peoples. The interdependence of the challenges facing humankind necessitates a paradigm shift in our perceptions and actions, particularly in Africa, whose priorities must be understood not through empathy but rather through pragmatism. In todayâ??s world, destinies of States are no longer isolated. Massive refugee flows, large-scale migrations, natural disasters and pandemics, which all touch on our collective consciousness, represent the sad illustration of that reality. Our new approach should place more emphasis on human beings and the restoration of their dignity if we want to eradicate poverty and achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the African Union Agenda 2063. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda at the international level and Agenda 2063 at the regional level constitute major steps forward in our fight against poverty, provided that we honour our commitments. The fact that Africa is lagging will not always be the case. Africa has been the most dynamic continent over the past decade. According to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, that growth will continue despite falling prices of raw materials, which are set outside the continent, and the fact that our economies remain heavily dependent on them. Given that situation, we need to diversify our economies and make them more resilient through increased investment in the sectors with real potential for sustainable growth, such as agriculture, infrastructure, information and communications technologies and energy. The industrialization and structural transformation to which Africa aspires will depend not only on our access to energy, but above all on the continentâ??s economic integration through the effective implementation of the continental free trade area, which is a prelude to an African common market. Africans yearn for prosperity, which is energetically embraced by the young population and is being addressed energetically by African leaders, who have decided to dedicate the African Union theme to 2017 to youth and to proclaim 2018-2027 the African Decade for Technical, Professional and Entrepreneurial Training and Youth Employment. The African Union has resolutely undertaken to find lasting solutions to the numerous challenges confronting young people with a view to making that stratum of society, which represents 70 per cent of our population, the real driving force of development on our continent. That will guarantee stability, security, peace and the harmonious and sustainable development of our planet. I therefore cannot fail to advocate for an African initiative aimed at recruiting, training and deploying 2 million community health-care workers throughout the whole of the continent. I urge the international community to support that initiative, which will create decent jobs, prevent pandemics and ensure the well- being of our peoples. Africa has decided to take responsibility for itself and to speak henceforth with one voice in order to find lasting solutions to its problems. The appointment of Heads of State as champions allows the African Union to talk with one voice on crucial matters. We have launched an institutional reform process to enhance the effectiveness of our Organization, streamline its action and reaffirm its political, economic and financial autonomy, thereby enabling us to play a leading role on the international scene. The Kigali decision to impose a 0.2 per cent levy on eligible imports to finance the African Union demonstrates Africaâ??s resolve to shoulder its responsibilities. In the same vein, we are determined to eradicate hotspots in Africa by promoting dialogue and finding African solutions. We urge the international community to focus its action to that end, in particular in Libya, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, where some parallel initiatives are inhibiting the return to stability. Africa must no longer be left on the sidelines of decisions affecting it. To that end, it will strive to establish an international institutional architecture equipped to effect the changes our people rightly expect. The Security Council, which has the primary responsibility of maintaining world peace and security, no longer reflects current realities. How is it that Africa, the third Power in terms of demography in the world, is not represented at an appropriate level within the Security Council, while 70 per cent of questions discussed there affect Africa? It is high time to repair that injustice, which has gone on for too long. We reiterate the pertinence of the African Common Position as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus. We call for the enlargement of the Security Council in the two categories of membership, including two permanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seats for Africa, chosen by the African Union. Furthermore, if it is not possible to abolish the veto, the new permanent members of the Security Council must enjoy the same prerogatives and privileges as the current members. In terms of managing crises and conflicts in Africa, the African Union promotes a regional approach. Partnership between the United Nations and the African Union must be part of a dynamic to build the capacities for action of regions, which can best understand the root causes of crises and conflicts and find appropriate solutions to them. To that end, Security Council resolution 2359 (2017), on the deployment on the joint force of the Group of Five for the Sahel, is an important milestone towards consolidating the partnership that we are seeking on questions of peace and security in Africa. I reiterate our appeal for the effective mobilization of the resources necessary to operationalize that force. The African Union will spare no effort to assume its responsibility to contribute 25 per cent to the financing of peacekeeping operations in Africa, as mandated by the Security Council. Regarding the prospect of silencing the guns by 2020, we welcome the vision of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, placing the quest for peace at the heart of his action, with a particular focus on preventive diplomacy. The African Union is fully committed to prioritizing prevention, mediation, promoting dialogue, finding peaceful political solutions and peacebuilding, which are less costly than peacekeeping operations, the effectiveness of which raises many questions. We encourage the reform initiative of Secretary-General Guterres, in particular the restructuring of the peace and security architecture, and recall that in order for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations to be viable and effective, it must include all Member States, which must be able to make their contributions through the dedicated intergovernmental processes. Regarding terrorism and extreme violence, the African Union firmly condemns the barbaric acts that have struck Mali, Burkina Faso, the Niger, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Iran, and reiterates its deep sympathy to and solidarity with the Governments and peoples affected by those heinous crimes. The African Union considers that only through increased international cooperation, especially with respect to the exchange of information and intelligence, will we be able to fight that scourge and stem its sources of financing. It goes without saying that our aims will be fully achieved only if additional efforts are deployed to eradicate poverty, exclusion and radicalization. We can defeat terrorism once and for allonly all by putting an end to poverty, as it flourishes in that climate. Africa must therefore manage its energy and develop its infrastructure in order to ensure inclusive development. How can we remain silent confronted with the daily torments of the Palestinian people, victims of occupation? The African Union reiterates its unfailing support to the long-suffering people of Palestine in its legitimate struggle to reaffirm its inalienable right to independence. Africa remains convinces that any viable and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily involves the creation of two States living side by side in security, within secure, internationally recognized borders based on those before 1967. We also remain very concerned by the situation on the Korean peninsula, and we urge all parties to exercise restraint. We reaffirm our commitment to the total denuclearization of the peninsula, in line with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The twenty-first century will undoubtedly be the moment when Africans will have a bigger and more decisive say. There is an increasingly strong feeling among African leaders and young people that the time for renewal has come. African women and young people are determined to write a new page in the history of humankind. Let us give them the opportunity or they will seize it for themselves. Together, let us create a globalization that is more humane and positive. Let us make our planet safer and let us preserve it. To that end, the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Plan of Action and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change offer a reference framework. Let us strive to implement them effectively. I cannot conclude without launching an urgent appeal to the international community to provide better assistance to Sierra Leone, affected by one of the worst natural disasters in its history. Once again, we offer our compassion to and solidarity with the people and Government of that brotherly country.",1,196
7767,Session 72 - 2017,GMB_72_2017.txt,GMB_72_2017,72,2017,GMB,"With warm greetings to all members of the General Assembly from the new Gambia, we thank the Almighty God for making this great gathering of global leaders possible once again this year. Allow me to formally congratulate the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the Organization on their leadership and commitment to the values of the United Nations. After more than 70 years of existence, the United Nations undoubtedly remains the ultimate international platform for finding solutions to global challenges, as we in the Gambia know all too well. Today, on my maiden appearance at this great forum of world leaders, let me take this opportunity to reaffirm The Gambiaâ??s firm commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. My Government fully appreciates the United Nations central role in the pursuit of preventive diplomacy to avert crises around the world. The recent political crisis that took place in my country created a new democratic beginning, and the experience taught us useful lessons that Gambians will not easily forget. We learned that willpower, national unity, decisive regional intervention and the undivided and clear support of the international community could produce positive outcomes. Also of importance was the coordinated international action inspired by our common values of solidarity, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, which were critical in sending the right message to the former President to respect the will of the people and leave without bloodshed. During those difficult times, we knew we had friends â?? ones who came to our aid and who have since kept faith with us. We therefore would like to seize this great opportunity to thank the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for their timely and firm intervention in bringing peace to The Gambia. We also thank all our regional and international friends who stood by us in our critical hour of need. Thanks to their collective efforts, The Gambia is now on a solid path to peace and good governance, and ready to resume playing our traditional role among the champions of human rights and democracy. Gambians have made an irreversible choice to close a dark chapter in our history, and today our national agenda is one of reform and transformation. Like any other restored democracy, we are facing enormous challenges in the revival of our economy and a comprehensive reform of our laws and our administrative and judicial institutions. The modernization of our security sector and the consolidation of the rule of law and human rights are part of our reform programme. It is only by overcoming these challenges that we can reinforce our democratic gains, and my Government is committed to delivering a new Gambia that is fit for our children to be proud of. Indeed, young people were all along at the forefront of our democratic transition, and addressing youth unemployment is a top priority for my Government and will no doubt create enormous opportunities. We also recognize the crucial role of Gambians in the diaspora in contributing to the transformation of our motherland. Let me seize this opportunity to sincerely thank our development partners and friends for the invaluable budget and policy support they are providing to the Government to help address the challenges of job creation and youth irregular migration. My Government is committed to using such resources wisely for sustainable socioeconomic development. We may be a small country but we have huge needs. As a matter of urgent priority, we have developed a national development plan in line with the transformative agenda of the new Gambia. This development blueprint is designed to put the country back on track to economic growth and prosperity following two decades of mismanagement, corruption and widespread human rights violations. This new plan is built on sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies that will lead to economic stability and growth over the medium and long terms. It has also incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals and other commitments contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement is critically relevant to The Gambia because climate change means a lot more in our situation. When land productivity declines and water shortage intensifies, young people from rural areas are often sent away to ease the burden on their families and to find new sources of income. This sadly explains why many young Gambians have been forced to make the long and dangerous journey to Europe. The journey is so risky that many perish on the high seas and never reach their final destination. Countless others disappear into immigration detention centres or vanish in the sands of the Sahara desert. Those who are able to complete the journey are often dismissed as economic migrants and sent back home. This sense of hopelessness and frustration also provides fertile ground for smugglers and extremist groups to recruit innocent young people into the criminal underworld. Young people do not deserve this experience; they deserve the chance to enjoy a safe and prosperous future at home. Creating new employment opportunities that provide young people with sustainable incomes and connect them to a revitalized land and a healthy and productive environment is an investment in the future of the nation. This is a key priority of our national development plan. Over the past decade, we have lost many of our friends and development partners through the wrong policy choices, but since the restoration of democracy and good governance many of our long-standing partners are coming back to work with us. We are in the process of rejoining the Commonwealth and the International Criminal Court. We are also committed to being part of the African Peer Review Mechanism. We are finalizing plans for a roundtable donorsâ?? conference to mobilize resources for the long-term development of the country. The continued support, solidarity and partnership of the international community will be critical to the success of that conference. Although The Gambia did not go through armed conflict, the political crisis that we experienced arose as a result of decades of bad governance, weak State institutions, the rule of fear and growing intolerance. We were on the brink of physical violence and armed conflict. We therefore express our deep appreciation to the United Nations Office for West Africa, the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office for the critical initial support they have rendered to my country. The pursuit of peace and security in Africa and the world will always be a major foreign policy goal for The Gambia. We will pursue good-neighbourliness and cooperation with our sister Republic of Senegal, and the countries of ECOWAS will remain our strategic partners. West Africa is on the march towards the consolidation of its democratic gains, but as a region we are facing serious threats to our peace and security. Terrorism, extremism, religious intolerance, organized crime and drug trafficking are seriously undermining our development efforts. Recent attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire and the Sahel in general underscore the urgent need for greater regional and international cooperation in addressing those challenges. The indifference, injustices and indignities in isolated parts of the world create real threats to global peace, prosperity and democracy. We need to take bigger and bolder steps to close the gap between the North and South, as the world is too imbalanced. We remain deeply concerned that the Israeli- Palestinian conflict still defies resolution. My Government firmly subscribes to the idea of a two- State solution for the two peoples to live side by side in peace and harmony. We therefore call on the Secretary- General to vigorously pursue that formula in the interest of lasting peace. Continued support in the areas of transitional justice and security sector reform will certainly go a long way towards entrenching peace, justice and democracy in The Gambia. 17-29281 13/24 There is a shortage neither of ideas nor of resources to fix the major problems facing the human race. What has always been scarce is political will, and unless adequate resources are invested the pace of development will remain slow and a minimal impact will be achieved. It is against that backdrop that I am calling on the private sector to emulate philanthropists in their generosity towards the most isolated, marginalized and deprived sections of the world. Providing safe drinking water, roads, power, health care and education is key to restoring human dignity. In our foreign policy, as part of our historic friendship we fully recognize the One China policy. The Peopleâ??s Republic of China is the sole representative of the Chinese people and a true friend of The Gambia. Our two countries continue to strengthen cooperation on the basis of a win-win approach, built on mutual trust and respect within the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. An organization like the United Nations, by virtue of its functions, will always require some level of reform of its management systems. The intergovernmental character of the mandates entrusted to the Secretariat requires the existence of trust and accountability between Member States and the Secretariat. As the United Nations embarks on its proposed reforms, we stand ready to give it full support in the interest of an effective and more relevant world body. Last but not least, one long-standing issue is the pending question of Security Council reform. Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said that no reform of the United Nations can be complete without reform of the Security Council. That remains true today. Africa will not give up its legitimate and historic quest for true representation on the Council, and The Gambia fully supports the African Unionâ??s demand for the long- overdue reform of the Security Council. I want to conclude by reaffirming my optimism and confidence in our collective ability to uplift humankind from the clutches of poverty; to institute a global order of peace, firmly held together by justice; and to love, care and tolerate each other. In tune with our national anthem, we pledge our firm allegiance to those values that we hold ever true. I offer the best wishes from the people of The Gambia â?? the smiling coast of Africa.",1,196
7768,Session 72 - 2017,GNB_72_2017.txt,GNB_72_2017,72,2017,GNB,"I am honoured to stand at this rostrum and speak to the international community gathered here in the full expression of our universality. Allow me to convey greetings from the people of Guinea-Bissau to all Heads of State and Government, representatives of the States Members of the United Nations, who have come to add pomp and substance to this session of the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. To your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson, I would like to express our recognition of his performance and wish him continued success in his remarkable diplomatic career. As we all know, the world today is full of complex and grave challenges, such as hotspots of political instability and geopolitical tension around the world, the seriousness of which cannot be overlooked by the statesmen and citizens of the world; the scourge of terrorism, which unfortunately does not seem to be abating, as a phenomenon that deserves our unanimous condemnation; the human tragedy of migration waves, particularly those crossing the Mediterranean, and the saga of refugees; glaring social inequality, the expanding geography of poverty, and the intensity of human suffering, which we see in vast areas of the planet; and the sorrow of racial, gender and religious discrimination and the threat of climate breakdown on a planetary scale, with prospects of frightening, and not unlikely, consequences. In short, it is not difficult to imagine how many ills of the world are addressed by the United Nations on a daily basis, and require the attention and constructive engagement of the international community represented here. The United Nations has a long history of solidarity with and commitment to Guinea-Bissau. It began with our struggle for national liberation and has not been broken since. Our goal is to further strengthen our institutional engagement with the United Nations. In so doing, we are merely reaffirming our firm belief in international law, peace and security among nations and the social and moral progress of humankind, which are the values on which the United Nations was created. We continue to be going through a period of institutional challenges in Guinea-Bissau, for which the Conakry Accord laid out a solution in October 2016. There are challenges related to the functioning of some of our core political institutions, namely the Parliament and the Government, but it is with profound solemnity that I inform the General Assembly that civilian peace reigns in my country. There are no reports of universal human rights violations that merit complaints or that are worthy of concern. Public safety indicators related to people and property follow a normal pattern. Regular payments are being made to public servants, and on the foreign debt service and internal arrears. The marketing campaign for our main export crop, cashew nuts, broke all records, which had a positive impact on the social environment in Guinea-Bissau. Recently, our public finance controls were praised by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral partners. The State and civil society are very far from any political breakdown. Indeed, we are fortunately not counting the dead or injured in Guinea-Bissau, nor are we assessing any damage to public property resulting from a breakdown in the authority of the State. The most recently held summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which convened in Monrovia, placed its trust in the Bissau- Guinean peopleâ??s determination to internally resolve the problems related to the political and institutional impasse that has affected my country for the past two years. In that regard, we are pleased that the African Union, at its most recent summit in Addis Ababa; the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) Council of Ministers meeting in Brasilia; and the United Nations put the political situation in Guinea-Bissau back on their agendas. With the patience, wisdom and solidarity of our international partners â?? ECOWAS, the African Union, the CPLP and the Secretary- General, who is retaining his Special Representative in Guinea-Bissau â?? we will overcome the political and institutional impasse that persists in my country. We have taken note of the General Assemblyâ??s agenda, which, in fact, is largely consistent with our own hopes and concerns. The subregion of the Economic Community of West African States where Guinea- Bissau is located has significant potential for economic growth, consistent poverty reduction and the sharing of social welfare. There is nothing unattainable in our dream to drive â?? at the subregional level, together, in peace and security, and with productive work â?? the inclusive social progress that we all desire. We have examples of success in our subregion, but we also see distressing signs on the ECOWAS horizon of potential threats to both the internal constitutional order of States and geopolitical stability in the subregion. Terrorist acts are seriously affecting Burkina Faso, Mali, the Niger, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire and Nigeria, with clear and grave consequences for peace, social cohesion and stability. Guinea-Bissau fully supports the pooling of efforts in the context of the Group of Five for the Sahel, advocates the integrity of Mali, and calls for an all- out fight against terrorism in all its manifestations. Indeed, in order to face so many challenges at the same time, namely internal security, the preservation of the territorial integrity of States and peacekeeping within the space of ECOWAS, we need help. We therefore count on the United Nations and all of its specialized agencies, and all our international partners. Only if we work together will we be able to transform our subregion into a bastion of peace and internal security and, by extension, a bastion in the service of international security. The Sustainable Development Goals are a challenge, but no development strategy is worthy of such a title if, in the case of Guinea-Bissau, it does not begin by placing the issue of food security squarely and sustainably at the core of its concept. To let Guinea- Bissau, a country with a widely recognized agricultural capacity, slip into dependence on large volumes of imported rice every year was certainly one of the worst economic policy mistakes that was made. The challenge we face is very clear. It is the political and economic challenge of food security. It is the moral challenge of overcoming poverty. It is the test of ensuring zero hunger in Guinea-Bissau. With that as the focus of our approach, we are merely restating the central item on the General Assemblyâ??s agenda in another way â?? promoting health from cradle to the grave. I will surprise no one when I state that there is no positive health indicator that can stand against the violence of poverty, hunger or malnutrition. There is no way to bring down the morbidity and mortality indicators that assail us as a result of the scourges of AIDS, malaria, diarrhoea and infectious diseases, without sustained poverty reduction, and if we do not successfully take on the moral challenge of zero hunger. At a more specific level, my country has made progress with regard to the health care that we provide to our population, in particular to children and women of reproductive age. However, given that the State alone is unable to guarantee that public service to the entire population, we continue to rely on international cooperation and United Nations support through its specialized institutions. But health and poverty are not the only elements that go hand in hand. In the context of poverty and extreme nutritional deficiency, we do not see how we can aim for good education for our children. According to recognized scientific criteria, 12 per cent of Guinea-Bissauâ??s territory is comprised of ecologically protected areas. In that regard, I can say without hesitation that one of our most important educational achievements has been the development of a vigilant, ecological awareness of an increasingly sharp and active sense of environmental responsibility, in particular among the youth of Guinea-Bissau â?? the foundation of our future. But we are realistic; we have a long road ahead of us and much effort to be made in order to ensure environmental sustainability, as we economically exploit our natural resources. We consider the Paris Agreement to be a fundamental victory in harmonizing Statesâ?? environmental policies and in their promotion worldwide. We must enhance our relations with the Peopleâ??s Republic of China, a country that has been our friend since the difficult years of our struggle for national liberation. As the One China policy is consistent with peace and security in the region and with Chinaâ??s yearning for its unity to be restored, we reiterate our full solidarity with the Peopleâ??s Republic of China. Security Council reform remains a need that the international community has rightly highlighted. Guinea-Bissauâ??s position is the same one that we, as an African country, advocated for and adopted within the framework of the African Union. I express the solidarity of the people and the Government of Guinea-Bissau to the people of the Republic of Sierra Leone, who have suffered greatly from the natural disaster that has assailed their country. We also offer our solidarity to all countries that have been victimized by natural disasters that cause irreparable loss of human lives, the destruction of property and great suffering among the survivors. I express the unfailing solidarity of Guinea-Bissau to the Republic of Cuba, which has provided support to the Bissau-Guinean people at our most challenging moments. Today, as in the past, we call for the lifting of the economic embargo that has prevented that friendly nation from developing normally for more than 60 years. We also support the hopes of the Palestinian people for the establishment of their own State, coexisting side by side with the State of Israel, based on trust, peace and security. I will close my remarks with a reference to the women of Guinea-Bissau. I would like to say that women in Guinea-Bissau are still far from taking the place that they deserve in our society and in our institutions in general. The policy of gender equality â?? more specifically of equal opportunity for girls and women in Guinea-Bissau â?? is undoubtedly a test for my countryâ??s democracy. It is a great challenge for our political parties and all Government officials in Guinea-Bissau. I hope that all of the political, economic and social actors in my country will continue to converge on the legitimate advocacy for womenâ??s rights and, in general, for the promotion of human rights in Guinea-Bissau.",1,196
7769,Session 72 - 2017,GNQ_72_2017.txt,GNQ_72_2017,72,2017,GNQ,"Although we currently live in a world of unrest and insecurity that is being scourged by an unprecedented global economic crisis, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is participating rather optimistically in the political and diplomatic open debates on the items on the agenda of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We believe that the topics selected for debate encapsulate the concern of every nation to achieve the objectives that were proposed in San Francisco in 1945, so that we can achieve a world of peace, well-being and security for humankind. We wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We believe that his wealth of political and diplomatic experience, that of his Government and the experience of the other members of the Bureau will help to guide our fruitful discussions to build a better world. We also hope that the work of this session will continue on from the previous sessionâ??s endeavours, during which, under the guidance of His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, the United Nations made a correct assessment of the current state of global affairs. That further fuels our optimism that we can arrive at definitive and sustainable solutions for the complex problems affecting our planet. In that joint endeavour, the work of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, has been highly praiseworthy, which is evident from the selection of issues before us. It should be recalled once again that Chapter I of the Charter of the United Nations enshrines the intent of its Member States to build a world of peace and well-being for humanity by encouraging friendly relations and mutual respect for the independence and sovereignty of every nation. No Member State should consider itself exempt from that duty. We believe that all the Governments of the world, if one is politically honest, are working for the welfare of their nations, which is why every country designs programmes to promote human rights, the democratization of society and socioeconomic development, thus ensuring the well-being of their populations. However, despite our optimism in this debate, we express our deep concern about the numerous armed conflicts and the sociopolitical instability that are ruining the socioeconomic structure of States, precisely because of interventions in the internal affairs of other States, which is specifically condemned by the Charter of the United Nations. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is greatly concerned, because major wars that have destroyed entire nations have had Member States as powerful participating actors. Such States believe that armed force is the only way to bring about peace and resolve conflicts, while forgetting that war can never do that. Rather, it compounds and perpetuates conflicts, leading to disorder, destruction, desolation and ruin. Military force should never be the recourse used by the United Nations to ensure international peace and security. The Assembly must remember that international peace and security can be ensured only when every country enjoys internal peace and each countryâ??s fundamental and inalienable rights are respected. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is fully aware of and grateful for the support and confidence of almost all Member States regarding its candidacy as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We wish to convey here our total rejection of the use of force as the only recourse available to the United Nations. We are party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We condemn not only the use and manufacture of such weapons in conflicts between States, but also their possession and distribution. We believe that the terms of that Treaty are still insufficient â?? they should include the destruction of nuclear weapons, wherever they may be. Their possession by some States makes other States believe they have the right to possess them as well. As a member of the Security Council, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea will cooperate with all States to ensure peace in the world, which should mean ensuring peace in each country and protecting its political, economic, social and cultural rights. There is also a great deal of uncertainty about the fact that, despite the commendable initiatives in the 1990s to combat malnutrition, hunger, climate change and others, and despite the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals held in 2010, after more than 20 years not much progress has been seen in those areas. On the contrary, there has been an increase in the number of people in the world who go hungry; the environment continues to deteriorate, causing major disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and the deaths of thousands of human beings and the destruction of the infrastructure needed for human existence. The United Nations is still very far from achieving the established goals for the well-being of humankind. We take this opportunity to express the condolences and solidarity of the people and the Government of Equatorial Guinea to the nations suffering from disasters: Mexico, the United States, the countries of the Caribbean and Sierra Leone, in Africa. At the same time that we see those factors, we are also witnessing international terrorism, extremism, xenophobia, human trafficking, emigration, piracy, the phenomenon of mercenaries, major epidemics, transborder crimes and an acute economic crisis that is currently affecting the entire world. All of those phenomena make it necessary to achieve greater awareness among nations of the need to establish more direct cooperation among States and for all nations to undertake united, dynamic and coordinated action. No matter how powerful a country may be, such events mean that we must all pay attention, because no State is exempt from the responsibilities resulting from the overbearing actions taken by some States against others. We must therefore focus more on bringing about peace in the world and ensuring a healthy environment, eliminating nuclear weapons and combating terrorism and piracy, which affect all countries. No country should act as a policeman who imposes on others the principles of good governance, to which we all have committed ourselves anyway. We want a world with a spirit that is equally participatory and egalitarian for women and men, and for nations large and small. We want a reform of the Security Council that enables the equitable participation of all continents and guarantees the rights of all nations. We want cooperation based on fairness. We want respect for the cultural principles and values that ensure the existence of every nation throughout the ages. The premise here is that, in the absence of wars and the adverse phenomena we have mentioned, the world could move towards sustainable development, the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 of the African Union. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea has taken a giant step forward in its development, such that expectations for its economic emergence have been estimated to occur by 2020. Unfortunately, however, its strategy has had to be considerably modified because of the current economic crisis. That is what is currently being experienced in our country with regard to peace and development. The threats to peace and stability that we have seen over recent years have been provoked from the outside, with attempts to occupy the country and acts of piracy and terrorism that have been aimed at destabilizing the peaceful and democratic system of the existing Government. They are attempts to disturb the peace and create riots for the benefit of fortune-hunting adventurers. That has resulted in unjust and gratuitous accusations against the leaders of our country and others in the subregion, disparaging the legitimacy of our national sovereignty, and even ignoring the decisions of international justice. All of that has been part of an attempt to confuse international public opinion about the reality of the progress achieved by Equatorial Guinea in order to justify, as always, an intention to impose so-called humanitarian intervention in our country. In conclusion, we appeal for greater global consensus to fight the phenomena impeding the progress and well-being of humankind. A more inclusive and participatory consensus on the strategies of action of the United Nations and other international economic organizations is needed. The United Nations must lead us forward with the idea of a globalized world engaged in united action that does not condemn or punish, but rather helps the most needy to overcome the challenges of development.",1,196
7770,Session 72 - 2017,GRC_72_2017.txt,GRC_72_2017,72,2017,GRC,"First of all, I would like to wish every success to the new Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and reaffirm our full support for his work. Allow me also to congratulate you, Sir, on both your election to the office of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and on the choice of this yearâ??s main theme. Our world is changing rapidly today. We are going through a second era of machines â?? an era in which machines are no longer an extension of physical strength but provide spiritual wealth and knowledge. Although today they are faster and smaller, they have an immense impact on our daily lives, affecting the way we work, produce, communicate and interact. This new trend could be described as the fourth Industrial Revolution. It brings with it innovations and advantages, as well as challenges, especially for States. These challenges must be addressed in an effective manner if we are to survive in the complex international reality of today. States have to show resilience and meet the needs of their peoples in terms of human rights, communication, growth and innovation. They have to evolve, but this evolution must linked to that of the Organization. Will the United Nations be able to keep pace with these developments and adapt to new, emerging realities? In the light of this double adaptation, this is an extremely critical time. It will require reforms that can enable the United Nations to remain relevant in an ever-changing world that is very different from the one that existed in 1945. If the United Nations is to retain its ability to fulfil its mandate, it must evolve to meet the challenges before us. As insecurity and instability abound over large swathes of the globe, Greece is formulating a multidimensional foreign policy with a view to actively contributing to the attainment of peace through concrete proposals in international forums and regional organizations and the promotion of stability through political initiatives. More specifically, we favour the prospect of broadening the agenda that the institutionalized dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations is addressing on an already wide array of issues of global concern. In line with our shared vision, we all want to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction. In that context, we firmly condemn North Koreaâ??s ongoing illegal nuclear-weapon and ballistic-missile programmes, including its most recent test, which seriously endanger regional and international peace and security. Considering the developments in disarmament and non-proliferation that we have seen over the past year, I believe that it is now more imperative than ever to seek avenues of dialogue with the participation of nuclear-weapon States. That could be a way to bridge the gap between the step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament and a non-verifiable immediate and total ban. While it is situated close to regions that are extremely turbulent, such as the Middle East and parts of North Africa, Greece continues to be a pillar of stability. In that context, we have recently undertaken many initiatives, such as the Rhodes Conference for Security and Stability and the International Conference on Religious and Cultural Pluralism and Peaceful Coexistence in the Middle East, held in Athens, as well as the recently established Ancient Civilizations Forum, whose latest meeting took place here in New York only yesterday. The Rhodes Conference focuses on a positive agenda of cooperation among 20 European and Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, with the aim of fostering stability and security in the region. I would also like to mention that, together with Cyprus, in a context of promoting peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, we have established a number of trilateral forms of cooperation that include Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. Our main objective is to develop a positive and multidimensional agenda for cooperation in international affairs, with a focus on synergies and joint activities, especially through culture, as one of the main drivers of soft power in international relations, and in other areas of cooperation such as trade, education and research. Enhancing regional cooperation in the Balkans is also the basic principle behind the Greek initiative of quadrilateral meetings launched in Thessaloniki in April 2016 between the Foreign Ministers of Greece, Albania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. At their forthcoming meeting in October, with a view to developing an effective response to the refugee crisis that is in line with European democratic values and principles, the four countries will focus on identifying ways for improving their interaction on issues such as return operations, the exchange of information and tackling smuggling, human trafficking, terrorism and organized crime and energy networks. The Syrian war has taken a terrible toll in human lives and has displaced millions. A cessation of hostilities is essential to ensuring progress in the political negotiations. Greece sees no alternative to a political solution to the crisis, and we fully support an inclusive political dialogue in Geneva under United Nations auspices. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a constant threat to regional stability and security, and the current situation on the ground is not sustainable. We support a two-State solution, meaning the establishment of a sovereign and independent State of Palestine living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, while at the same time ensuring that Israelâ??s long-standing quest for security is satisfied. With regard to Libya, Greece considers the international efforts to stabilize the country to be crucial. We firmly believe that there can be no military solution to the crisis in that country and support every effort to achieve peace and security there. Terrorism remains one of the major global challenges we face, and the significant progress we have seen recently in the fight against Daâ??esh deserves special mention. Strengthening international cooperation among all the relevant actors and improving the exchange of information constitute key elements in tackling the flows of foreign fighters. At the same time, we must address the root causes of violent extremism. Greece is actively involved in our shared fight against terrorism. In the context of the work of preventing terrorists from exploiting resources for their activities, we particularly support international efforts aimed at promoting concerted international action against the illegal trade in antiquities and cultural artefacts. We consistently pursue friendly relations and enhanced cooperation with all our neighbours with a view to promoting stability and prosperity for all. In the Western Balkans, Greece remains a firm supporter of the European Unionâ??s enlargement policy. The rise of nationalistic rhetoric in the region is very worrying, however. We want to underline that actions and statements that undermine good-neighbourly relations should be avoided at all costs. We should also emphasize that we maintain a friendly approach to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Greeceâ??s initiative aimed at designing and implementing bilateral confidence-building measures has strengthened relations between us and facilitated efforts to address more sensitive matters, such as the ongoing issue of our neighbourâ??s name. In that respect, Greece will continue its systematic efforts to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the issue of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedoniaâ??s name. Our position is clear â?? the name must be mutually acceptable. Where Greek-Turkish relations are concerned, we believe they can be built only on a basis of full respect for international law, including the international law of the sea. We have repeatedly pointed out that good- neighbourly relations are not served by a neighbour that persistently challenges Greeceâ??s sovereignty and sovereign rights. With regard to the Cyprus issue, our objective is summed up in the concept outlined by the Secretary-General at the international Conference on Cyprus â?? which is to make Cyprus a so-called normal State, one that is sovereign, independent and free of foreign-occupation troops, external guarantees and rights to intervention. Unfortunately, the July Conference on Cyprus in Switzerland ended without an agreement being reached, because the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot sides were the only parties at the Conference that did not share the goal of the normal-State concept. Greece is prepared to continue discussing the key international issue of security and guarantees as soon as Turkey demonstrates clear willingness to resume negotiations on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as within the framework of the parameters outlined by the Secretary-General in Crans-Montana. In the area of civil and political rights, we actively support the fight against racism and all forms of discrimination, whether on religious, gender, sexual or any other grounds. In that regard, Greece, with the aim of prioritizing the safety of journalists and media workers, especially in conflict areas, will submit a relevant thematic draft resolution in the Third Committee at the current session. In the framework of the Human Rights Council, my country has also spearheaded an initiative with its successful submission of a draft for Human Rights Council resolution 35/28, on the convening of the Social Forum in 2018 in order to focus on the promotion of human rights through sport and the Olympic ideal. My country remains committed to the protection of human rights in all policies that address large movements of migrants, with particular attention to the needs of migrants, including children, in vulnerable situations. We also believe that implementing that framework correctly is more important than ever if we are to protect those who need it, combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling and return those not entitled to international protection to their homes, while at the same time tackling the root causes of migration through effective cooperation with countries of origin and transit. Finally, the issue of ensuring the social and economic inclusion of legal migrants is equally important and deserves our full attention. Greece has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring the full and effective implementation of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and its annexes, adopted by the Assembly at its seventy-first session. We also emphasize our commitment to working in the context of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration to be concluded by 2018. I would like to assure the Assembly that, as a founding Member of the Organization, Greece will lend it its unfailing support as the United Nations works to rise to the task of creating a more peaceful and prosperous future, with justice and solidarity for all, especially for generations to come.",1,196
7771,Session 72 - 2017,GRD_72_2017.txt,GRD_72_2017,72,2017,GRD,"I bring warmest greetings from Grenadaâ??s Prime Minister, the Honourable Keith Mitchell. Prime Minister Mitchell sincerely believes in the work of the General Assembly and is absent only because he believes that, as Chairman of the Caribbean Community, his presence in the region allows his colleague Prime Ministers to travel to New York to plead the cases of their hurricane-stricken countries. Our hearts and prayers go out to all the victims in our Caribbean region, in Mexico and across the world who are presently suffering the adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters. Within the last few weeks, our fellow members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the Caribbean small States of Barbuda and the Commonwealth of Dominica were ravaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria, which caused near-total destruction and the loss of many lives. Our hearts also go out to the people of Cuba, with whom our region shares a very special friendship. I implore the international community to recognize without delay our responsibility to assist all those affected by natural disasters. I join those before me in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as President of this international organ. I am confident in your stewardship and assure you of my delegationâ??s cooperation and support. I also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his able stewardship of the Assemblyâ??s seventy- first session. I also wish to thank both you and Secretary- General Guterres for your leadership and willingness to serve as guardians of the spirit of our Charter of the United Nations. I believe there is value in repeating your astute and entirely relevant observation that the Charter makes only five references to war, while peace is referenced 47 times. Over the next few minutes, I will endeavour to offer Grenadaâ??s interpretation of what it means to strive for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, the theme for this session. I would like to say a few words on climate change. I am sure that almost every speaker here mentioned something about climate change, because, as we all know, it is a very relevant and topical subject. Certainly, based on recent activities in the Atlantic, we just cannot dispute that the climate is changing. In fact, 97 per cent of actively publishing climate scientists agree that climate change is due to human activities. For those who question the veracity of that science, the cluster of extreme weather events over the past few years ought to suffice for sounding the alarm. Extreme weather events disproportionately affect our planetâ??s most vulnerable, such as women, children and the elderly. Therefore, Grenada advocates that special attention be paid to those groups. As we assess the physical damage caused by such disasters, let us never forget the psychological toll they take take on survivors. We reiterate Grenadaâ??s commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Speaking in his capacity as Chair of the World Bankâ??s Small States Forum in June, Grenadaâ??s Prime Minister lamented the withdrawal of key partners from the Agreement. Therefore, we encourage them to reconsider. The Government of Grenada has adopted an ambitious Blue Growth agenda to take advantage of our vast maritime territory and its countless resources. Grenada aims to be the beacon of sustainable development for maritime States around the world. Our relatively small size makes it an interesting and achievable project. Our Blue Growth master plan offers many opportunities for collaboration. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has emphasized the need to advance measures to develop sustainable ocean-based economies in the Caribbean. The word â??Caribbeanâ?? reminds us of beautiful beaches, such as the world-famous Grand Anse beach in Grenada. Our recent endeavours aim to use our maritime waters in a sustainable manner, governed by robust policies in our peopleâ??s interest. I previously alluded to the many variables that influence the sustainability of our planet. Small States such as Grenada and other CARICOM countries have to battle to maintain our access to financial markets. In March, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a report titled, â??Recent trends in correspondent banking relationshipsâ??, which highlights some of the challenges facing the financial institutions and Governments of small States. Observing that the number of correspondent banking relationships has decreased, the IMF anticipates a negative effect on global trade and economic activity this year. Furthermore, in the specific cases of Grenada and the rest of CARICOM, the high cost of compliance with the international tax agenda was underscored at the Ninth General Meeting between the United Nations system and the Caribbean Community in July. Added to the threat of lost correspondent banking relationships, we also have to deal with the unilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions as money launderers and tax havens. Grenada has worked tirelessly to sign tax information exchange agreements and has signed 14 of those agreements since 2010. It pains us as policy-makers when we expend our limited resources to comply with rules, only to face unjust consequences when we are quite evidently in compliance. There are no easy answers to those challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from draconian approaches to such matters when dealing with vulnerable small developing States such as ours. Grenada also supports resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. We also believe that renewed dialogue may augur well for the discovery of a mutually acceptable solution for both parties. Lastly, on finance, I am proud to report that Grenadaâ??s structural adjustment programme has been highly commended locally, regionally and internationally. In May, the IMF reported that â??Grenada has continued with steadfast implementation of reforms and made progress toward achieving the key program goals.â?? Through the leadership and wisdom of our Prime Minister and the sacrifices of the Grenadian people, Grenadaâ??s economy is on solid footing today. Grenadaâ??s thriving economy is proof that the structural adjustments are not inherently bad. Investment, both foreign and local, is at its highest levels in recent years. Although we are cautious to declare victory, we are very confident that we are headed in the right direction. Grenada believes that all 7 billion of our planetâ??s humans are entitled to certain fundamental human rights. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights is unambiguous. We should all be guided by article 1 of the Declaration, which states that all humans are born free and equal. On the issue of international security, Grenada continues to work with our international partners in the interest of world peace. Grenada is active and compliant numerous matters of international security. Grenada views the situation on the Korean peninsula with great trepidation and the hope that the conflict will be resolved peacefully. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is inherently destructive and serves no useful purpose for humankind. Therefore, Grenada urges its friends and allies to desist from all development and testing of such weapons. Each year, $105 billion are spent on developing nuclear weapons. That amounts to around $12 million per hour. If we are willing to make the shift from destruction to construction, the people of Barbuda, Dominica, Cuba, Mexico and other countries suffering from recent disasters will be forever grateful to the world. Grenada remains concerned by recent political and social developments in Venezuela. In his capacity as Chair of CARICOM, Grenadaâ??s Prime Minister has offered CARICOMâ??s help in facilitation of dialogue between the Government and the opposition in Venezuela. CARICOMâ??s approach must necessarily be impartial. CARICOM will not attempt to dictate terms to either side. We seek to encourage meaningful dialogue on the premise that the Venezuelan people can come together to safeguard the future of all of Venezuela. In the meantime, Grenada believes in the art of diplomacy and the principle of respect for sovereignty. Turning to matters of health, the year 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the landmark signing by CARICOM Heads of Government of the Port of Spain Declaration on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While some progress has been made in reducing NCDs, there is still much work left to be done. The Caribbean region has the highest burden of non-communicable diseases in the Americas. Therefore, we urge key allies to continue to partner with us as we attempt to correct that unfortunate reality. Grenada has made important progress in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS. Only 0.3 per cent of our population presently lives with the disease. The work of Grenadaâ??s National Infectious Disease Control Unit and our health-care practitioners and policymakers must be highly commended for their work in that regard. That work, however, is greatly supported by international assistance that is being depleted â?? as it already has been in some Caribbean countries â?? without foreseeable replenishment. Grenada thanks the Global Fund, the United States Presidentâ??s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Pan American Health Organization and the German Development Bank for their assistance. I urge donors to be flexible in their relief responses. We cannot wait for data while our people suffer. The data will come eventually, but in the meantime, lives, families and communities are at stake. I would like to close with the assurance that Grenada believes in the United Nations system. I have had the honour of representing the people of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique on several occasions at this noble institution. As I retire from active political life, I am very optimistic that the window is still open for us to leave a peaceful, habitable and prosperous planet for future generations. The challenges of our time are dynamic and continuous, and we would be remiss to put anything but our planet first.",1,196
7772,Session 72 - 2017,GTM_72_2017.txt,GTM_72_2017,72,2017,GTM,"May my first words be of solidarity with the people and the Government of Mexico, given the tragedy that has beset that beautiful country today. Guatemala has made available a search-and-rescue team. Similarly, we wish to express our most sincere solidarity with all the Caribbean islands that have been affected by storms and hurricanes. I am grateful to Mr. Peter Thomson for his excellent stewardship as President of the General Assembly during the previoius session, and I wish Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k every success as President of the Assembly at its current session. I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome most warmly Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, whom I have already congratulated. As a sign of of our commitment to peace and development, on 6 July we signed our commitment to the national development agenda, which incorporates the Sustainable Development Goals in our national development plan â?? Kâ??atÃºn: Our Guatemala 2032 â?? in order to achieve the goals, targets and indicators set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and thus to affect the well-being of Guatemalans. Similarly, my country has as its priority guaranteeing food security, attaining respect for and promoting human rights, ending poverty, improving the lot of the most vulnerable, stewarding our natural resources and making gender equality a reality. Guatemala is committed to submitting to its third Universal Periodic Review by the Human Rights Council next November and to a review of its compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In a historic event for indigenous peoples, we have drawn up, through consensus and inclusive dialogue, an operational guide for the holding of consultations with indigenous peoples, pursuant to Convention No.169 of the International Labour Organization. The guide will help public institutions to comply with their obligations in consultation with indigenous peoples on the type of development they want to achieve. Again on human rights, I wish to recall that Guatemala, after 36 years of internal armed conflict, signed a peace agreement and took on the even more arduous task of peacebuilding. That conflict was conditioned by international ideological polarization engendered by political doctrines that are alien to us. Its aftermath weakened State institutions, preventing them from providing necessary services to our people. We recognized our weakness in proceeding alone and therefore turned to the United Nations. At our initiative, we entered into an agreement with the Organization to establish the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). That experience is unique in the world and has an important mandate that necessitates faithful compliance, not only only as it pertains to us but as a function of the rule of law. The Commission started its work in 2007. At first, it was to last for two years, a period that has been extended five times, most recently on 4 September. This extension, which I signed in advance, shows our firmest commitment to strengthening and supporting the Commission so that it achieves its goal of transferring its capacities to the State institutions, without setback or challenge. My Administration has significantly increased the budget allocations for the justice sector. The increase is unprecedented in the history of the country so that it may have a strong judicial system. CICIG has performed much good work, and that is precisely why we support it. The limits of its mandate are the political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala, the laws of our country and the agreement itself â?? the establishment and elaboration of CICIG. We â?? Guatemala and the United Nations Secretariat â?? are the guarantors of its observance. It is a principle of our country that nobody should interfere in the administration of justice. Whatever form interference might take â?? direct or indirect, through the media or any act that, though it might not appear connected, could affect sovereignty â?? it could affect the working of the country. Our Government is fully committed to the fight against corruption and impunity. We have therefore begun the process of reviewing the interpretation and the correct implementation of the CICIG agreement, whereby we hope, in an objective and balanced fashion, to perfect, fine tune and correctly implement the task of the Commission, while guaranteeing due process, the presumption of innocence, and avoiding, at all costs, selective persecution, the politicization of justice and a litigation culture in politics. We trust that we will soon begin the relevant actions for both interested parties. The environment is one of the many issues that we wish to address. On 25 January, Guatemala signed and ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. That is a clear demonstration of my countryâ??s level of commitment to meeting its international and national obligations in that regard. I take this opportunity to thank President Emmanuel Macron for his initiative in the global pact for the environment, which we support. Aware of its own high degree of vulnerability and threats of nature, Guatemala already has a national action plan on climate change, so that our domestic legislation may be carried out to achieve mitigation, adaptation and resilience to climate change. With regard to nutrition and food security, with the support of the World Food Programme we have put together the final report of the strategic review of the situation in Guatemala in that regard, with an emphasis on chronic malnutrition and its root causes. With that tool, we are working hard on our national strategy for the prevention of chronic malnutrition for the period 2016-2020, which is related to the Sustainable Development Goals. Faced with the threat of transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, my Government has made the strengthening of justice and security institutions a priority. With that goal in mind, we have been working hand in hand with our international partners to end crime, corruption and drug trafficking once and for all. In June, the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America was held in Miami, in which Guatemala was recognized for its strong commitment to the Alliance for Prosperity, its continued support in the fight against drug trafficking and its determined work to advance the shared goals of promoting security in the region. A major issue for my country, with which we have always dealt seriously, is the interinstitutional and international efforts in the migration phenomenon, with special emphasis on the alliances with El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and the United States of America. Alongside those actors, we have focused on efforts to boost the economy and improve security conditions in order to reduce migration and decrerase the risk migrants face when embarking on a dangerous journey in search of a better quality of life. That is why we value the efforts of all States Members of the Organization in the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is planned as an updated mechanism within the United Nations that prioritizes the capacity, work and contribution of migrants, regardless of their immigration status. Consistent with the need to care for our nationals, we have expanded our consular assistance in the United States in order to promote and protect the human rights of migrants in this country and provide consular assistance closer to them. I would also like to mention that, in April, Panama and Guatemala signed an information exchange and migration alert agreement, which facilitates the mobility of people from both countries and establishes cooperation links in migration matters. In that context, I want to refer to our so-called young dreamers, who help make up a group of people who bring talent, knowledge and work to the development of the communities where they currently live. Like other countries that count on dreamers protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, Guatemala hopes that human sentiment and the regional solidarity of the Government of the United States will prevail so that in the coming months Congress will adopt legislation that allows that group of young people and children to attain permanent legal status and enable them to stay and study in the United States. My countryâ??s role in the multilateral sphere aims to contribute to strengthening the conditions for sustainable peace on the ground. It is precisely in that sphere, where peacekeeping is one of the most noble tasks of the Organization, in which Guatemala is proud to participate. Our commitment is reflected in the deployment of our contingents to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other missions on the African continent where we actively participate, as well as in Haiti, where Guatemalan personnel directly support national efforts with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, whose mandate is about to end. We are also honoured to continue participating in the United Nations Mission in Colombia. We will continue to contribute constructively to those international efforts with the highest level of professionalism and dedication. Guatemala, in line with the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative on nuclear weapons, strongly condemns acts of provocation and destabilization that undermine international peace and security and increase tensions not only at the regional level, but also worldwide. Those acts impede peaceful dialogue with a view to contributing to denuclearization. We have repeatedly condemned the nuclear tests carried out by North Korea, as they are a flagrant violation of international law and various resolutions of the Security Council, as well as of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Collective security can be achieved only through the prohibition and total elimination of nuclear weapons. For that reason, tomorrow Guatemala will sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, thereby taking an important step to reach a world free of nuclear weapons. My country is concerned about the serious situation facing the Venezuelan people. The political crisis afflicting that beautiful fraternal country is drifting towards the possibility of a rupture of the democratic order, a lack of constitutional guarantees, the violation of human rights and continuous acts of violence, persecution and political repression. We share the serious concern of other countries of the region. That is why we seek to explore ways to contribute to the restoration of democracy in that country through a peaceful and negotiated exit. Before the Assembly, I want to reaffirm the commitment of my country to resolving permanently and definitively, in the International Court of Justice, our territorial, insular and maritime dispute with Belize, a country with which we aspire to have a privileged relationship and a permanent dialogue about the solution of our common problems. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to send a message of unity to my country. We are experiencing a moment of polarization that is not favourable to that and will not lead us to any safe place. I have welcomed the call for dialogue by some parties, and today, as a democratically elected representative of national unity, I call on all sectors to engage in a serious dialogue on themes that are truly structural, in which we seek solutions to the problems, with all of us participating and helping as a nation. That participation will allow us to speak of deep reforms to the State, which we must solve in the areas of security and justice, and of economic and social development, both rural and urban, as well as the issue of political participation and the functioning of the State. I will return to my country, as always, with hopes of a better future.",1,196
7773,Session 72 - 2017,GUY_72_2017.txt,GUY_72_2017,72,2017,GUY,"Let me begin by expressing the deep condolences and solidarity of the Government and people of Guyana to the victims of yesterdayâ??s earthquake in Mexico and those of Hurricane Maria, which virtually destroyed the Commonwealth of Dominica two days ago. The Cooperative Republic of Guyana congratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We are confident that under your guidance progress will be made in advancing the international agenda and realizing the theme of this yearâ??s Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Guyana also appreciates the sterling performance of your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, in his stewardship of the Assembly during the past year. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment last year and to wish him a successful tenure. Today, I am speaking of people, peace and the planet. Nothing is more important in this general debate than ensuring that all representatives here respect its theme, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. First, the theme enjoins us to focus on people â?? people of all countries and in all circumstances. It is about the human condition of people in States that are large and small, rich and poor, strong and weak. It is about humankindâ??s condition everywhere on Earth. The world is facing several serious humanitarian crises. In too many parts of the world, children still die from preventable diseases or go to bed hungry. In some places, women are denied equal opportunities for enjoying a good life. The gap between the worldâ??s rich and poor remains unacceptably wide. Conflicts within States have spawned international refugee crises, resulting in the displacement of millions from their homelands. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent our collective desire and determination to eradicate hunger and poverty from our planet while promoting equal opportunities in education, employment and social justice for both men and women. The adoption of the SDGs has catalysed our aspirations for a better world into concrete and forward-looking actions and objectives. The Goals seek to promote respect for peopleâ??s inherent dignity and their rights as human beings. However, their advancement is being obstructed by human rights violations, by peopleâ??s involuntary migration from their homelands and by terrorism and warfare. The challenge for the United Nations is resolving to reinforce respect for the rights of citizens within the governance structures of our Member States. Secondly, I am speaking of planet Earth. A sustainable planet is humankindâ??s ultimate patrimony. Nothing is more vital to peopleâ??s survival. We have been indifferent too long to the need to protect the planet, and now its sustainability is threatened on many fronts. Climate change is not a fiction or the invention of a few extremists. This year, the small island States of the Caribbean and parts of North America have felt the devastating fury of a series of hurricanes â?? Harvey, Irma, JosÃ©, Katia, Lee and Maria, to whose frequency and ferocity humankind has contributed through the reckless exploitation of Earthâ??s resources. Hurricane Irma was a deadly, destructive portent of the extreme vulnerability and fragility of the small island developing States and low-lying coastal States of the Caribbean, and Guyana is playing its part, within the limits of its resources, to provide relief to the affected populations of our sister Caribbean States. Guyana signed and celebrated the Paris Agreement on Climate Change last year in this very Hall. We renew our commitment to its goals this year in a demonstration of Guyanaâ??s pioneering role in global environmental stewardship. It must be remembered that in 1989 â?? three years before the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was held in Rio in 1992 â?? Guyana had the foresight to enter into an environmental covenant with the international community by dedicating 360,000 hectares of its rainforests, â??to develop, demonstrate and make available to Guyana and the international community systems, methods and techniques for the sustainable utilization of the multiple resources of the tropical forest and the conservation of biological diversityâ??. Twenty years after that international initiative, Guyana entered into an agreement with the Kingdom of Norway, â??to work together to provide the world with a relevant, replicable model of how Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, known as the REDD-plus programme, plus conservation and sustainable forest management, can align the development objectives of the forest countries with the need to combat climate changeâ??. Guyana is part of the Guiana Shield, one of the worldâ??s last remaining blocks of pristine rainforest. The Guiana Shield is the source of 15 per cent of the worldâ??s freshwater reserves. Its biodiversity provides ecosystem services, such as food, fresh water and medicinal products. It provides environmental services, such as the regulation of the water cycle, water quality and pollination. The Shieldâ??s forests capture and store carbon, mitigating the greenhouse effect. In other words, the Shield is essential to life on Earth. Guyana calls on the United Nations to help protect and preserve the Guiana Shield as a global resource for the survival and sustainability of our planet. I will now speak of peace. Striving for peace has been the principal purpose and preoccupation of this Organization throughout its existence. A good life for the worldâ??s peoples and sustainable use of the planetâ??s resources are predicated on peace with justice, including justice within and between States. The world is weary of war. Striving for peace must be humankindâ??s ceaseless quest. The United Nations is the paramount global instrument of peace. It has a vital role to play in ensuring respect for international law through the International Court of Justice and the Security Council. In striving for peace, we must aim to resolve long-standing inter-State conflicts. In that regard, Guyana supports the call for reform of the Security Council, in order to give an even greater voice to developing countries. We reiterate our support for a two-State solution to the Palestine-Israeli conflict. We affirm the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and a dignified existence. We demand the withdrawal of the injurious economic embargo on the Caribbean island of Cuba, which frustrates its right to development. Striving for peace and the right to development have been Guyanaâ??s most serious concerns since national independence in 1966. When I addressed the Assembly last September (see A/71/PV.8), I explained the danger that we have been facing on our borders as a consequence of the territorial claims of our neighbour to the West, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. I outlined to the worldâ??s nations the peril that Guyana was enduring on its borders at the hands of Venezuela. Venezuelaâ??s claim to Guyanaâ??s territory, however, has not diminished or been diverted. Guyana remains imperilled. Disturbing developments in Venezuela have attracted the worldâ??s attention and roused the concerns of many of us about the privations of its people. The Caribbean people want the Caribbean to be a zone of peace. Venezuelaâ??s claim on Guyanaâ??s territorial integrity, however, would be a threat to that zone and that peace. Venezuela is more than four times the size of Guyana, and yet it claims two-thirds of Guyanaâ??s territory, including its maritime space. We depend on our territorial and maritime resources for our countryâ??s development and for propelling our people out of poverty. After 51 years of Guyanaâ??s independence, the Venezuelan claim persists. An eminent international tribunal provided a full, perfect and final settlement of the issue 118 years ago, in 1899. Venezuela repudiated that arbitral award in 1962 in the Special Committee on Decolonization, as British Guiana â?? as we were then â?? strove to achieve its independence. This is a warning to the world, through the Assembly, that peace will be jeopardized in our region if justice does not prevail, not only within Venezuela, but also with regard to its border controversy with Guyana. Four Secretaries-General have been seized of the Venezuelansâ?? claim. The choice has become one between a just and peaceful settlement in accordance with international law, and a Venezuelan posture of attrition that is increasingly blustering and militaristic. In this matter, protraction is the enemy of resolution and the ally of sustained conflict. Fortunately, as they indicated publicly, former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and current Secretary- General AntÃ³nio Guterres have both decided that if, based on the 1966 Geneva Agreement, significant progress has not been made by the end of 2017 towards arriving at a full agreement on a settlement of the controversy, the International Court of Justice will be the next means of peaceful settlement, unless Guyana and Venezuela jointly request otherwise. Guyana has been working assiduously with the Secretary-Generalâ??s personal representative and looks to the international community to ensure that Venezuela is not allowed to thwart the process of judicial settlement, which is the clear and agreed path to peace and justice. The people of the world yearn to fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment â?? an attainable objective of the Sustainable Development Goals endorsed by the United Nations. Peace for the worldâ??s peoples is the mandate of the United Nations. Peace can be achieved by addressing the worldâ??s humanitarian crises, promoting justice within and between nations and resolving long- standing conflicts between States. Planet Earth can provide a good life for all. The planet can be protected from the ravages of climate change and reckless damage to its ecology and biodiversity. United, the nations gathered in this Hall can fulfil the promise of the Charter of the United Nations and the theme of the General Assembly to focus on people, strive for peace and protect the planet.",1,196
7774,Session 72 - 2017,HND_72_2017.txt,HND_72_2017,72,2017,HND,"On behalf of the people of Honduras, I would like to extend greetings to the General Assembly. The Honduran people extend solidarity to their Mexican brothers and sisters in the wake of the recent tragedy. I reiterate our commitment to continuing to provide supplies and support. Three years ago, I addressed the General Assembly for the first time. Three years later, I would like to reflect on how Honduras has met the challenges it has encountered. Today, I would like to share with the Assembly and with the world how we are building a new Honduras. Four years ago, transnational organized crime in Honduras led to high levels of violence seen in very few countries around the world. At the end of 2013, there were 75 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, and two years prior to 2013, the figure stood at almost 90 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. From 2013 to date, however, the murder rate of 75 per 100,000 inhabitants has fallen by almost 30 percentage points. The most recent Global Peace Index issued by the Institute for Economics and Peace indicates that our management of the situation has placed Honduras 17 places higher in the global peace ranking. We have also managed to lower our fiscal deficit to 3 per cent from 8 per cent of gross domestic product. We have improved the Honduran economy and growth this year stands at 4.1 per cent. Our exports have increased, investments are on the rise and our national reserves are enough to purchase almost six months worth of imports. The countryâ??s national currency has been revalued and inflation is very moderate. Risk-rating agencies have raised Hondurasâ?? credit rating. Our rating is now the best we have ever had. This year, we, along with neighbour Guatemala, started the first customs union of the Americas. Honduras and Guatemala now have a zone with free movement of goods, services and people. In addition, we are negotiating with our brothers of El Salvador and Nicaragua to join the customs union and, in the future, we hope that Costa Rica and Panama will also become members. In that way, we will become the seventh largest market in Latin America. El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras have also launched a plan to develop the Gulf of Fonseca, which has the support of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. That will enable us to create a genuine hub for economic, tourism and social development in the Pacific region. It will be the regionâ??s first special economic zone. This region, formerly rife with conflict among the three nations, will become a development hub for the good of our three countries. I would also like to share with the Assembly the fact that Honduras is poised to make extraordinary headway in attracting investment. I am referring to the establishment of employment and economic development zones, in which both national and international investment will have institutional guarantees in four key areas â?? the legal, economic, administrative and political spheres â?? based on good practices that are familiar to companies and workers in prosperous countries. My country and peopleâ??s very productive labour force will then have the best opportunities in the world, under the Honduran flag. Based on the economic development plan, Honduras 2020, we will be creating at least 600,000 new jobs for Hondurans over the next five years. Over the past four years, we have invested approximately $2 billion in infrastructure to make Honduras a major logistics hub in Central America. We have built airports, ports in the Atlantic and the Pacific, highways, an interoceanic highway and a next-generation customs model. All of this will allow the Central American region to have an outstanding logistics system. We are also making strides in the areas of transparency and counter-corruption. We are the only country in the world that has signed an agreement with Transparency International to work with that organization in five civil service sectors. We have made considerable progress in applying international standards when acquiring and setting up infrastructure, through the Construction Sector Transparency initiative. We are cleaning up our national police. We are creating a new police institution. We are strengthening our public ministry. We are created anti-corruption courts. We entered into an agreement with the Organization of American States to establish what we call the Mission of Support against Corruption and Impunity. In addition we have reorganized system through which the national health system purchases medicines. In line with our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 1, our Administration has implemented the most ambitious social programme to protect our most vulnerable citizens. We have named this programme Better Life. It helps us to bring dignity to our compatriots suffering from extreme poverty. There are already nearly 2.5 million participants involved in at least one of the components of Better Life. I would also like to state that Honduras fully supports the reform of the United Nations system promoted by the Secretary-General in order to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our countries face major challenges due to climate change, the emergence of the nuclear threat, poverty, organized international crime, terrorism, racism, intolerance and human rights violations. These are challenges that we must analyse and face together with determination and absolute commitment. Climate change has been relentless, bringing a tragic series of hurricanes and tropical storms. I wish to express our solidarity and condolences to our brothers affected by the destructive force of these recent natural phenomena, and we encourage the Assembly to assist the countries, predominantly in the Caribbean, that have suffered so much devastated. Honduras will be present, as we have already offered, for our brothers. Nuclear weapons also pose a serious threat to humankind, and worse still is the threat of using them. Honduras rejects the recent nuclear-weapons tests. We support the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, as well as the channels conducive to the diplomatic management of tensions and threats to world peace. Poverty is high on the agendas of Governments in developing countries. We have a duty to overcome the structural conditions that exclude large sectors of our societies from access to goods and services that would otherwise allow for a dignified life and opportunities for the comprehensive development of peoples, families, our communities and our countries. Poverty has effects on the environment. It fosters internal and international migration and has serious social consequences stemming from the breakdown of the family breakdown and the separation it engenders, generating insecurity and violence. It causes much suffering. We must combat poverty with social safety nets, access to basic health and education services, inclusive and sound credit and technical assistance to avoid depriving people of the goods that are essential to life. However, as developing countries we face the problem of the criterion that developed countries have adopted to allocate cooperation resources. What do I mean? Just think. The criterion used is that of classification by means of the national income of countries at three levels: high, medium and low. The premise is that most help will go to low-income countries, and that middle- and high-income countries have a greater internal capacity to overcome poverty. Because of that, the countries that are most harmed when it comes to access to international aid are those classified in the middle-income category, as is the case for Honduras. Our country is committed to the defence and promotion of human rights. For Honduras, respect for the human person constitutes a State policy. We recently established a secretariat for human rights. We have institutionalized a mechanism for dialogue between the Government and human rights organizations, and we also manage the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras, which is already open and functioning. It is very painful for any person to be forced to leave their family, customs and the land of their birth. The migrants of our era are our new martyrs. They are the new heroes who fight abroad, fight adversity, work tirelessly, carry out the most difficult work under the most difficult conditions and yet still press on. They are still able to contribute to their countries of destination with their talent, culture, dedication, efforts and by paying taxes. Our Honduran compatriots, who migrated when they faced difficult circumstances in our country, make us proud of their endeavours, and we therefore demand that they be treated in a way that is dignified and commensurate with their contribution to the countries to which they have gone to build a new life. Honduras is endeavouring to improve the conditions of our citizens so that they do not have to leave, to abandon their homeland and families in search of opportunities in other countries. However, we are also working with our brother countries in Latin America to ensure that there is recognition of the contribution of those who, due to natural phenomena, have been granted temporary protection status, and for children who had to leave with their parents, grew up far from their homeland and began to dream in another. May those dreams continue. May dreamers imagine a new world and be fuelled by hope, turning their yearnings into reality. We have worked for that new world the last four years. That new world is the reason we are here today. We are confident that our actions will allow us to see the rising of a new sun, of a new day. Nothing and no one can forbid us to dream. Let us continue to dream. Together, we can build a better world for our children and for the children of our children.",1,196
7775,Session 72 - 2017,HRV_72_2017.txt,HRV_72_2017,72,2017,HRV,"Let me take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to all those affected by the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria and to the people of Mexico, who have been hit by successive earthquakes in past few days. Twenty-five years ago, my countryâ??s first President, Franjo TuÄ?man, addressed the General Assembly as Croatia was being admitted to the United Nations, which brought us back into the fold of free nations. At that time, he appealed to the international community to help end the aggression against Croatia and establish lasting peace. Since then, my country has been rebuilt, modernized and profoundly transformed and has become one of Europeâ??s top tourist destinations. Today Croatia is a State member of the European Union and NATO. Building on its unique historical circumstances, we are now actively participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe and providing development aid to societies in need. I address the Assembly as the Prime Minister of a country that in that relatively short time has served on the Security Council, presided over the Economic and Social Council and chaired the Peacebuilding Commission, and which is currently a member of the Human Rights Council. Today we celebrate the International Day of Peace. I would like to reiterate that, as a peace-loving nation â?? as symbolized here at the United Nations by the recently restored Peace Monument by our great sculptor, Antun AugustinÄ?iÄ? â?? Croatia is a strong advocate of a rules-based international order. At the national and global levels, we believe that institutions need to be more open to the public and genuinely involve people in their decision-making. It is only through an active and informed citizenry that we can make Governments accountable and create credible institutions. Only well-functioning institutions ensure the implementation of the rule of law. Such citizen involvement brings about a welcome mix of representative and participatory democracy by bringing forward substantiated arguments and avoiding superficial and misleading populism. Croatia places great emphasis on peace, justice and strong institutions as one of the 17 goals to transform our world. Our own experiences in building State institutions were a particular challenge for a country that achieved peace and re-established its territorial integrity only 20 years ago. Croatia is dedicated to assisting others in post-conflict transitions with its own experiences in reconciliation and confidence-building. We were a recipient of international security assistance, including through several United Nations missions. One of the most successful peacekeeping missions to date was the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, which ended in January 1998 with the peaceful reintegration of our formerly occupied territories. We put at the worldâ??s disposal that unique know-how and extensive expertise as a useful complementary contribution to the international communityâ??s efforts in similar situations, such as with the implementation of the Minsk agreements in Ukraine, where we can draw many parallels. Discussing strong international organizations globally also means addressing the strength of this institution â?? the United Nations. As the world changes, our firm belief is that the United Nations must also keep up and change. Croatia supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s drive to reform the Secretariat, especially in peacekeeping and development. The Secretary-Generalâ??s surge in diplomacy is also a much- needed development. Security Council reform is central to United Nations reform. It is vital that its membership â?? both permanent and non-permanent â?? be regionally balanced and more reflective of the world 70 years into the Organizationâ??s life. In particular, we believe that the path to achieving that goal would be expedited by enlarging both categories of membership, including by ensuring that the Group of Eastern European States is better represented in the Security Councilâ??s non-permanent membership. One of the effects of globalization is that the world is faced with an unprecedented number of people on the move. Refugee crises and mass migration are a reality. One in 30 people around the world is a migrant. Croatia has faced acute refugee and migrant crises in the past. The approach we took â?? and will always take â?? was one that put people first. In the context of the upcoming negotiations on the global compact on migration, we advocate an approach to human mobility that prioritizes the safety, dignity and the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, no matter where they come from or where they are headed. As with all global challenges, a holistic approach is required in that regard. We therefore need to work together to fight the root causes of mass migrations â?? be it poverty, failing States and wars or climate change and natural disasters â?? while standing against exploitation and abuse in the context of human trafficking and people smuggling. In the framework of the European Union, Croatia is working with its partners on stemming the illegal flows of people, especially from the Eastern Mediterranean-Balkan route, while at the same time providing concrete support to countries of origin to address root causes, in particular through its development aid programmes. In addressing crises across the globe, our focus should be on early warning, prevention and diplomacy. Any post-conflict measure comes too late, especially in terms of human life. Conflicts need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and require tailor-made approaches. While a consistent approach to conflicts by the United Nations, and in particular by the Security Council, is essential for the Organizationâ??s credibility, copy- pasted, one-size-fits-all approaches are not the most effective way to proceed. In understanding the situation and risks on the ground, we must in particular draw on the knowledge and experience of local populations, neighbouring countries and regional organizations. Croatia believes that when addressing conflicts and crises â?? be it in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else in the world â?? it is important to have a global, comprehensive approach based on solidarity and coordinated international effort under strong United Nations leadership. Such an approach would include political, humanitarian, socioeconomic, stabilization and security elements, and in which reconstruction goes hand in hand with reconciliation and building resilience. Our contribution to peacekeeping operations will continue to be an important component of our foreign policy, both through direct participation and sharing our experiences and expertise or know-how. Croatia has contributed to 19 United Nations peacekeeping operations to date, and we are currently preparing our contribution to United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Like many other countries, apart from United Nations peacekeeping operations, we also participate in international operations led by other organizations, such as the European Union, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal values. We should spare no effort in their promotion and protection. Any violation of human rights requires an immediate and appropriate response. We advocate tighter links between the Human Rights Council and the Security Council. We also acknowledge the importance of the principle of the responsibility to protect. We take particular pride in the fact that one of Croatiaâ??s top diplomats leads the United Nations efforts in that regard. We welcome the establishment of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, as it is evident that there is a real need for strategic coordination and leadership for our global counter-terrorism efforts. It is also necessary that we continue working on preventing and countering radicalization and violent extremism. Croatia fully supports the recent unanimous Security Council action on North Korea, whose actions represent a direct threat to international peace and security. We appeal to the North Korean authorities to discontinue developing and testing nuclear weapons and to fully meet their commitments under international law, the relevant to the Security Council resolutions and the global non-proliferation regime. Adherence to the standards, principles and rules of international law and their faithful implementation provide a firm foundation for lasting peace and stability worldwide, to which we are deeply attached. In that regard, I would particularly like to recall the principles of good faith and free consent. We believe that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means and in conformity with international law. It is of the utmost importance that all international adjudications meet the highest legal standards and fully respect their own relevant rules. Compromising the impartiality or independence of international adjudicators or tribunals, as was the case in the terminated arbitration process between Croatia and Slovenia, makes their decisions legally void â?? and left Croatia with no choice other than to withdraw from the arbitration process. We consider that that example of undermining the rule of law is a discouragement for States considering third-party dispute settlement. At the same time, we want to solve the open border issue with our neighbouring friend and ally Slovenia through bilateral dialogue. In addition, Croatia strongly supports the full and unequivocal implementation of all applicable rules of international humanitarian and criminal law, as well as the full investigation and punishment of all atrocities. Preserving peace and stability in South-East Europe is obviously of key importance for my country. While the world faces many overwhelming challenges, we should bear in mind that regional stability in South- East Europe is still to be entrenched. By transferring our knowledge and promoting the integration of the countries of South-East Europe into the European Union and NATO â?? if they so wish â?? Croatia actively encourages stability in the region. We believe in building strong societies in our neighbourhood, while aiming to shift away from containing crises towards prevention, political dialogue and active engagement. That is especially important in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the proper implementation of the constitutional equality of its three constituent peoples â?? Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats â?? is a prerequisite for ensuring the full functionality and stability of the State and its European integration process, which we wholeheartedly support. Two years ago, through the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the international community properly recognized the limits to the reach of individual Governments. Universal challenges indeed demand our joint response. In addition, cooperation with academia, the business community and civil society is indispensable, but it would be unwise not to also tap the ideas and ingenuity of each individual in our respective societies, especially of our youth, who, in the age of modern technology, are absorbing knowledge and acquiring skills in a faster and more open manner. It is therefore our global task to adjust our educational systems to form future responsible citizens, to give them job opportunities and fit the real needs of our labour markets. Coming from Croatia, the homeland of the great inventor Nikola Tesla, I cannot but stress how vitally important it is that the United Nations facilitate a transformation towards the age of the digital economy and narrow the digital divide, which could generate new inequalities. Eradicating poverty remains our primary development objective, since it is a cause and consequence of conflict, instability and crises. But it is only by paying equal attention to transformational, cross-cutting elements â?? such as human rights, equality, good governance, the rule of law and inclusive societies â?? that we will be able to achieve true sustainable development. As we are witnessing the daily erosion of climate conditions and increasing natural disasters, more is required from humankind. That burden is ours to bear. In recent months, unfortunately, my country was not spared wildfires and floods either, which reached unprecedented dimensions. Those increasingly worrying warnings are a call to action, without delay. Croatia has already demonstrated its dedication to global efforts to preserve the environment by ratifying the Paris Agreement. Two days ago I expressed our principled support to the new French initiative â?? the Global Pact for the Environment â?? aimed at better coordinating global action against climate change. In the context of sustainable development, synergies among global, national and local policies need to be strengthened. We believe that next yearâ??s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will offer a platform to discuss efficient measures for a true transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, such as the pivotal goal of making cities and human settlements inclusive and safe, while granting their inhabitants a proper quality of life. Croatiaâ??s commitment to multilateralism is unwavering. We believe in the United Nations system and our joint potential to promote effective, inclusive and sustainable global governance based on the rules and principles of international law. It is with that aspiration in mind that Croatia joined the United Nations 25 years ago. A quarter of a century later, I stand before the Assembly with the same noble ambitions and responsibility for respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and economic betterment, for solidarity with humans living in precarious conditions and for common issues concerning our planet. Only with joint vigour to that end can we advance and materialize our professed common goals and values. It is incumbent upon us to do so, and the time is now.",1,196
7776,Session 72 - 2017,HTI_72_2017.txt,HTI_72_2017,72,2017,HTI,"At the outset, I would like to convey our sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. Today, all eyes rightly turn to the United Nations, whose mission has never been so essential. That is why we must pursue the reform process started years ago, in order to better adapt our Organization to modern reality so that it can effectivelyattain the goals enshrined in the founding Charter of the United Nations. In that connection, I welcome the vision and leadership of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. I hope that under his able leadership, the Organization can honour the commitments and initiatives aimed at improving living conditions for everyone on our planet and enabling the United Nations to confront global threats and prevent and resolve conflicts. The Republic of Haiti fully supports any initiative that reduces international tensions, defuses crises and achieves peaceful settlements to disputes. We believe that the United Nations must act in the context of conflict prevention. The Republic of Haiti has always spoken out against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and firmly condemns any tension generated by the desire to possess and produce nuclear weapons. In the Middle East, the Syrian crisis continues to shock our universal conscience. In this very Hall, numerous resolutions have been voted on calling for an end to that inhumane tragedy, which has left countless dead. The prevailing status quo in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, punctuated by intermittent violence, will obviously not produce a solution. The Republic of Haiti calls for an honourable exit from the present situation that can benefit our brother people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and urges all the parties involved to engage in dialogue and negotiation. The successful negotiated outcome of the conflict in Colombia shows that it is not armed confrontation and blind violence that resolve disputes. May the victory in Colombia serve as an example to us all. The Republic of Haiti, true to its ideals of peace, dialogue and friendliness among peoples, would very much like to see a window of opportunity offered to the Republic of China on Taiwan, so that it can participate in the major decisions that we, the Member States, have adopted to improve the human condition on planet Earth. As I address the Assembly for the first time, I recognize our immense responsibility for addressing the environmental challenges and threats confronting the planet. The Republic of Haiti is committed to the environmental dimension of sustainable development. As an island State, Haiti is determined to strengthen its resilience in the face of the natural disasters that affect the Caribbean region every year. The Haitian people are making tremendous efforts to recover from the damage caused by Hurricanes Matthew and Irma. Similarly, the unprecedented scale of destruction by consecutive hurricanes inflicted on our sister Caribbean countries, including Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica, as well as parts of Texas and Florida in the United States of America, shows the adverse effects of global warming on our planet. In that regard, the Republic of Haiti would like to express its solidarity with the victims in general and the people of the Caribbean in particular. We also stand with the victims of natural disasters and the people and the Government of Mexico. In that regard, my country attaches particular importance to the fulfilment of commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, especially since the prospects for sustainable development are shrinking in the wake of environmental crises and climate degradation. We therefore hope that major greenhouse-gas-emitting countries will contribute the necessary resources for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. We firmly believe that we must honour the pledge to equip the most vulnerable countries with the means to help them make the energy transition to renewable energies and bolster their resilience to the adverse effects of climate change. In the Caribbean, and in Haiti in particular, the latest events have reminded us of the extent to which climate change affects our countries. And at the same moment, the spectacular power of Hurricane Maria threatens us again. But the fact is that what happens to us is not fated, but is rather a result of human beingsâ?? actions on their environment, which we have a shared responsibility to repair. The victim countries, including the Republic of Haiti, do not have the spare resources to respond adequately to the tragic consequences of climate change. I call for an increase in insurance coverage for hurricanes and other natural disasters. The small Caribbean countries, with severely limited economic resources, need an insurance system that is proportionate to the threat. To that end, in January 2018, when Haiti assumes the presidency of the Caribbean Community, we intend to organize a regional conference to set up an inter-State commission to agree on an appropriate strategy. It will be a logical follow up to Haitiâ??s call at the fifth summit of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, held in CancÃºn, Mexico, in May, for the creation of a regional fund to finance programmes to mitigate the effects of natural disasters in the region. The fund would be financed based on a percentage of the gross domestic product of the affected countries and by developed countries that emit greenhouse gases. Haiti would like to take this opportunity to appeal to States Members of the United Nations that are affected by climate change to take this approach as well. This year unquestionably marks a break with the instability that has been such an obstacle to the development of the Republic of Haiti. Since my accession to the presidency on 7 February, my Administration has worked to consolidate democracy and the rule of law by making efforts to create conditions conducive to socioeconomic development and political and social stability. First, the Haitian Government has been uncompromising in tackling corruption â?? overbilling for public contracts, misuse of State property and cheques made out to fictitious employees, all facilitated by corrupt individuals who, through such despicable crimes, steal the fruits of education from the children of the Haitian people. Corruption, in all of its forms, plagues and atrophies the economy. It has deeply weakened our political foundation and destabilized the countryâ??s social fabric. Corruption is a crime against development. The millions of dollars spent Haiti in recent decades were sometimes channeled into contracts that destabilized the national economy to our peopleâ??s detriment. It is therefore high time that official development assistance and our domestic resources served the interests of the entire Haitian nation. Corruption deprives the Haitian Government of the resources it needs to provide basic services to the population. If it is not stopped but rather continues to spread, it will fuel political and social instability. It deprives the vast majority of Haitians of adequately distributed electricity, a quality education for their children, clean drinking water and social and economic opportunities. With the aim of reversing this devastating trend, the new Haitian leadership is waging a determined struggle against corruption. As regards the public administration, the Government is working on five priorities based on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are working with Parliament to strengthen our republican institutions in order to provide citizens with better access to public services. This policy has been given tangible form through the Caravan of Change, a strategy aimed at providing electricity 24 hours a day through clean energy. We are looking to manage groundwater, irrigate agricultural land and tend to our rivers, which, if not cared for, pose an environmental threat. We are also striving to overcome our housing deficit and to provide 12,000 more classrooms throughout the country. With regard to the rule of law, measures currently under way aim to guarantee the independence and increase the effectiveness of our judicial apparatus. We are strengthening our fight against corruption, contraband and impunity. We are reinforcing public security by continuously improving and building the capacities of the Haitian National Police. At the same time, we are remobilizing Haitiâ??s armed forces, which are working in accordance with a new development framework and strictly in line with the Constitution. The international community has been supporting national and public security in Haiti for 13 years, and with every national disaster, friendly countries have had to come to the aid of the Haiti people, showing why we need a strong defence force and why Haiti, following the departure of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), will gradually establish a military force to accomplish three key mandates. We will first create an engineering unit able to contribute to major public-works projects and intervene promptly following natural disasters. Secondly, we will launch an aviation unit for training young people in aeronautical mechanics and pilots able to fly helicopters in the wake of natural disasters; and thirdly, we will have a medical unit able to care for the victims of natural disasters and residents of the most remote areas of our country. On the economic front, despite our lack of national resources, the Government is mobilizing all levers at its disposal to get the economy back on a path to growth. This year, through a legislative agenda based on the joint efforts of the political parties, we have enacted eight of nine laws geared to improving the business climate. Similarly, through its dynamic policies, my Administration is taking necessary if politically controversial measures to get Haitiâ??s economy back on a path to growth and to create decent jobs, particularly for young people concerned about their futures. In that regard, our human resources management office is working in a framework of State reform, through public examinations, to recruit 12,000 young civil servants in order to give new impetus to the growth and development of public administration, and will be replacing civil servants who are on the brink of retirement. We are determined to provide other alternatives and opportunities, particularly to the most vulnerable sectors of our society, to ensure that they are not tempted to leave the country, sometimes putting their lives in danger, in search of better living conditions. Haiti cannot continue to see its young people flee in search of opportunities, driven by the corruption and the destruction of national institutions that have significantly widened the gap between citizens and the State. We wish to thank all friendly countries of the region who have taken in Haitian migrants and will therefore contribute actively to international efforts in 2018 to adopt a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The Haitian Government has undertaken efforts to give its agricultural sector new momentum through the Caravan of Change. All of the countryâ??s departments will benefit from the public authoritiesâ?? efforts to develop their potential for social and economic development. In one area of Artibonite, and in the South, in Grandâ??Anse and Les Nippes, we have already launched a strategy whereby the once moribund State will relaunch long- neglected but essential work. We intend to do our all to halt the accelerated degradation of the environment and make Haiti more resilient to climate change, improve basic essential public infrastructure, increase the provision of basic services, and stimulate the private sector and foreign direct investment. What is really at stake here, and what is crucial, is creating an enabling environment for strong, sustained and inclusive growth that will create jobs. Our long- term goal is to make Haiti a magnet for investment. The Haitian people are acutely aware that they are primarily responsible for taking ownership of and organizing the country in a sovereign fashion. All our endeavours at the economic level are focused on making rational use of our scant resources and doing everything we can with them. While we are deeply grateful to the United Nations for its commitment to Haiti, I would be remiss if I did not recall two lamentable situations that have arisen from its presence in our country. On the one hand, we have seen odious acts of sexual exploitation and violence committed by certain peacekeepers or other members of United Nations staff; and on the other, we have witnessed the introduction of a cholera epidemic into Haiti. The harmful consequences of these demonstrations of international solidarity imply, as the United Nations has already recognized, a moral obligation to enact measures to provide the resources necessary to eliminate cholera in Haiti. Improving the health-care system, including by eradicating cholera, is a priority of the Haitian Government. Despite the recent progress, the number of victims stands at approximately 10,000 and, regrettably, continues to grow. There are tens of thousands of cholera orphans. The time has therefore come for the United Nations to truly live up to its noble ideals, based fundamentally on respect for human rights, by assuming its full responsibility for remedying a situation that has done serious harm to the Haitian people. It is high time that the United Nations honoured the commitments it has made under the new approach to fighting the cholera epidemic recommended by the Secretary-General and approved by the General Assembly. We therefore align ourselves with the urgent appeal launched by Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres to establish a trust fund to fully implement the two components of this new approach. We also welcome the decision taken by the General Assembly to reallocate $40.5 million from the MINUSTAH budget for 2015-2016 to the fight against the epidemic. We would like to see other international partners follow that example. We want to ensure that the sick receive adequate care, that the victims and their children get due compensation, and that drinking water and sanitation systems in Haiti are developed under the auspices of the National Directorate for Drinking Water and Sanitation. The Republic of Haiti is resolutely committed to making progress and strengthening the rule of law. Of course, these objectives remain works in progress. The new leadership of Haiti will spare no effort to foster the great transformations necessary to bring the State out of its traumatic and painful lethargy. The Haitian Government is working tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of its people. These are vital prerequisites for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Political stability is the most important of all public goods, as I said in my election campaign. In that regard, I intend to continue the dialogue I began last week on building robust institutions in the political sphere, a dialogue in which almost all the political parties in Parliament and all local authorities took part. Moreover, in the coming weeks, my Administration will begin a national consultation in all sectors with a view to achieving the stability required to undertake a programme of economic and social development over the next 25 years at least. Economic, political and social stakeholders in Haiti are aware of the overriding obligation they have to promote social peace in order to fulfil the destiny that has been reserved for our noble and great nation, a cradle of liberty, equality and fraternity, the Republic of Haiti.",1,196
7777,Session 72 - 2017,HUN_72_2017.txt,HUN_72_2017,72,2017,HUN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. For those of us from Central Europe, it is highly significant that a Central European candidate was elected to such an important position. It shows that Central Europe is a strong region that has attained success through policies that are based on rationality and common sense. His election, along with the fact that Poland was elected to the Security Council as a non-permanent member, serves as proof that the Visegrad Group is strong and capable of speaking with a loud, united voice. Now, as we convene at the General Assembly, it is evident that we are living in extremely challenging times. Economic, political, defence and military relations are changing extremely rapidly. Coming from Central Europe, I would like to highlight three very important issues from our perspective: migration and the threat of terrorism, the relationship between the East and the West, and the rights of national minorities. Europe currently finds itself on the front lines of significant global changes. Since the end of the Cold War, Europe has never had to face as many challenges as it does now. As a result of the migration crisis, Europe is facing the most serious threat of terrorism in its history. The European Union is facing its toughest challenges since its foundation. Western Europe used to be the most secure, safest and most peaceful region globally. A couple of years ago, we watched the news on television about terror in the Middle East, and we were sure that such events would surely never take place in Europe. To the contrary, the fear of terrorist attacks has become a part of everyday life. Between 2015 and 2017, Europe suffered 30 major terror attacks, which took 300 innocent lives. Churches, airports, beaches and concerts have become sites for execution, which can take place within a couple of seconds. That development is a direct consequence of two phenomena. The first is the massive influx of illegal migrants. During the past two and a half years, 1.5 million illegal migrants have entered European Union territory without any kind of control, checks or regulation. That has definitely provided an opportunity for terrorist organizations to take advantage of that flow and send their terrorists and fighters to the European continent. Secondly â?? and here I will surely offend some by breaking taboos and challenging dogma â?? we must admit that the earlier social integration procedures in the Western part of Europe have failed. Some of the attempts to integrate migrants who arrived in Europe previously have been totally unsuccessful and, in many places in Western Europe, parallel societies have been constructed. We must honestly admit that we are shocked, after the barbaric terrorist attacks in Europe, the massive violations of national and international laws and regulations, and the loss of thousands of lives on the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere, that there are still leaders of international organizations and representatives of powerful countries who claim forcefully that migration is a favourable phenomenon that is to be encouraged. That is extremely irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour. Encouraging waves of migrants endangers tens of thousands of people â?? there are those who risk their lives to reach a place where they think they might find a better way of life, and those who are put at risk of becoming victims of the terrorists who seek to take advantage of those migratory waves. Hungaryâ??s position is quite clear. All States have the fundamental right and responsibility to ensure the security of their own people, all States have the fundamental right and responsibility to protect their own borders, and all States have the fundamental right and responsibility to make decisions on their own â?? including as to whom they allow to enter their territory and whom they do not. Hungary has made enormous efforts to comply with its international obligations. We have spent â?¬800 million on protecting not only ourselves and the border of Hungary but also the external border of the European Union and the external border of the Schengen Area. We have also built physical infrastructure and mobilized human resources. Again, altogether that has cost â?¬800 million. I must remind the Assembly that this is not the first time in history that we have had to protect the Western part of Europe as well as ourselves. But of course, as we are a Christian country, we accept our responsibility to help those in need. Hungaryâ??s principle is to provide help when it is needed, and that is why we help and assist Christian communities in the Middle East so that they can stay or return once conflicts are over. We have spent almost â?¬2 million rebuilding 200 houses in the Iraqi township of Telsqof, making it possible for more than 1,300 people to return. We have spent â?¬4 million on building schools, covering medical expenses and ensuring that Christian communities are able to stay and flourish. We offer 100 scholarships on an annual basis to youngsters whose families are being persecuted in the region. We understand that the rights of people should be restored when they have been violated. We must work to help people stay as close to their homes as possible, and we have to help people return to their homes as soon as possible. We call for more support for countries that have taken care of refugees from war-torn areas, such as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and the Kurdish region of Iraq. However, we are all aware that a complete and definitive solution for the migration crisis can emerge only by tackling the root causes, which includes overcoming military conflicts beyond Europeâ??s borders and eliminating terrorist organizations. I would like to turn now to my second point, namely, the relationship between the East and the West. I represent a small Central European country, and we are all aware that major international conflicts can be resolved through agreements between the super- Powers of the West and the East. This is why pragmatic cooperation between East and West is necessary if we wish to eliminate the most dangerous terrorist groups worldwide. Hungary is therefore proud to contribute 200 troops to the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Cooperation between the East and the West is necessary if we wish to overcome the war and create peace in Syria, thereby making it possible for people to return and in order to decrease the migratory pressure on Europe. It is necessary to create peace in Libya and ensure stability there for the future. It is also necessary to address the extraordinary challenge posed by a communist dictator who is threatening the world with a nuclear programme, violating all possible international regulations and values. We Central Europeans read this from history: whenever there is a conflict between the East and the West, Central Europe will certainly lose out. We do not want to be losers anymore. That is why we call for a better and more pragmatic relationship and cooperation between the East and the West based on mutual trust and respect for each other and for international law. In my third, and final, point from a Central European angle, I would like to highlight the importance of the rights of national minorities, which is a highly sensitive issue for Hungary, as millions of Hungarians live outside our borders. The rights of national minorities are among the most highly protected in international relations. There is an international consensus â?? we believe, at least â?? that the rights of national minorities must be respected by all members of the international community, and discrimination against any kind of minority is simply unacceptable. One of the most important elements of national minority rights is the right to use and receive education in oneâ??s mother tongue. Why is that so important? Because the best way to create difficulties for national minorities is to prohibit them from using their native language by law. It is not an accident that language rights are also enshrined in a variety of guiding documents and international standards on the matter, such as the 1992 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, the three principles on language and education of UNESCO and the various recommendations of the United Nations Forum on Minority Issues on the implementation of the the Declaration. Those documents describe a similar basic approach for State authorities to meet their human rights obligations involving language. Unfortunately, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a new law on education on 5 September. That new law drastically curbs the already acquired level of minority rights in education and language use. The new law takes away the right to receive an education in their mother tongue from all children older than 10. It is a shame that we are seeing that kind of legislation adopted in the twenty-first century in a country that is making great efforts to make quick progress on the economic integration process of its Association Agreement with the European Union. That law clearly discriminates against the minorities living in Ukraine. Article 1 of the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education clearly states that, â??[t]he term â??discriminationâ?? includes any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference which, being based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in educationâ??. It is obvious that the new Ukrainian law on education clearly violates those United Nations conventions and international norms. We therefore stress that it would establish a very dangerous precedent if the United Nations were not to act and remained silent in that regard. We strongly urge the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to begin investigating the new Ukrainian law on education and use all the means at his disposal to address the serious violations of fundamental minority rights brought on by the new Ukrainian law. Hungary will always stand by Hungarian communities, regardless where they live in the world, and we will never let them down. That is our obligation. That is our responsibility, and it comes from our heart, as well.",1,196
7778,Session 72 - 2017,IDN_72_2017.txt,IDN_72_2017,72,2017,IDN,"Allow me to begin by wishing a happy new year to those who celebrate the Islamic New Year 1439 Hijri. May peace be upon us all. I would also like to extend Indonesiaâ??s deep sympathy with and condolences to those affected by the recent natural disasters, including the earthquake in Mexico, the hurricanes in the Caribbean and parts of the United States, as well as floods in South Asia and other parts of the world. Our prayers go out to all the victims. May I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. Indonesia is committed to contributing to his successful presidency. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji for his able stewardship as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We commend his role in driving a universal push for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are all represented on the same world map, yet we see many different worlds. Our world today is far from equitable. The peoples of our world experience war, hunger, extreme poverty and illiteracy. Peace and equal prosperity are far from being reached. Therefore, Indonesia welcomes the theme of this yearâ??s session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. The theme recognizes the importance of placing the needs of our peoples first and highlights the fact that peace, prosperity, and sustainability are mutually reinforcing. In that context, I wish to underline three important points for achieving peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. First, it must be underlined that peace is never given; rather, it has to be developed and nurtured. We must work towards creating a global ecosystem of peace and stability. Indonesiaâ??s experience in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations shows that building such an ecosystem is fundamental. It is fundamental for economic development and fundamental for the prosperity of the people. Indonesia firmly believes that developing a global ecosystem of peace and stability is doable. However, to succeed we must practice the habits of dialogue, inclusiveness, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use of force. More importantly, we must develop the United Nations as a robust global institution that emphasizes the maintenance of peace, security and stability. Key to that is ensuring that the United Nations reform process results in a strong, effective and relevant United Nations. It was for that reason that Indonesia co-sponsored the declaration of support for United Nations reform. Furthermore, we must also strengthen international peacekeeping and peacebuilding mechanisms. Indonesia is honoured to have played a part in mediating conflicts, peacekeeping and peacebuilding beyond our borders. We have been and will always be ready to be a part of a global solution. Over the past 60 years, we have contributed more than 38,000 personnel to 28 United Nations peacekeeping operations. We currently deploy more than 2,700 peacekeepers in nine peacekeeping missions. We are also determined to contribute 4,000 personnel by 2019 and increase the number of female peacekeepers. Beyond peacekeeping, Indonesia is an active member of the Peacebuilding Commission. We underline the need to ensure sustainable peace at the global level, which requires a global culture of prevention. It is also important to ensure a strong partnership among the United Nations, the relevant regional organizations and national Governments. A global ecosystem of peace and stability requires the international community to settle one of the longest- standing unresolved conflicts â?? that of Palestine and Israel. This year marks half a century of the illegal occupation of Palestine. We shall not give up. Palestine is at the heart of Indonesian foreign policy, and Indonesia will continue to support it. After 50 years of stalemate, we need a fresh approach â?? one that is sustainable and innovative and can bring about a two- State solution. We must not stop with the attainment of sustainable peace. A decent life for all people must be our global goal. That leads me to my second point. There must be synergies between sustaining peace and the development agenda. We must cultivate peace and stability to work for us in achieving sustainable development. The international system is well equipped to attain a decent life for all. A number of global commitments have been agreed, including the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to name but two. However, commitments must be translated into concrete actions. The key to that is the means of implementation for the least developed and developing countries. Adequate funding, technical assistance, capacity-building and the transfer of technology are important elements for success. It is also important to support regions with huge potential that have undertaken great reforms towards sustainable development. Africa is one such region. For Indonesia, South- South and triangular cooperation is our way to support development in the least developed and developing countries. Over the past three years, we have organized 167 South-South and triangular cooperation programmes, from which more than 2,000 participants from the least developed and developing countries have benefited. Indonesia is also proud to host the first Indonesia-Africa Forum in April of 2018, which shows our commitment to strengthening a partnership with Africa towards achieving sustainable development. Synergy between sustaining peace and the development agenda requires a society that is just and inclusive and fully respects human rights. There should be no more man-made humanitarian crises in the world. Indonesia shares the concern of the international community regarding the developments in Rakhine state. We have proposed a 4+1 formula to the Government of Myanmar, placing the needs and welfare of the people at its centre. It would first require restoring stability and security. Its second tenet is restraint and non-violence. Third is to provide protection to all people in Rakhine state. Fourth is immediate access to humanitarian assistance. We also wish to implement the recommendations of the team led by Kofi Annan. That is why a people-centred Government must be at the heart of national development programmes. That is why Indonesia continues to strengthen democracy and good governance at all levels. Over the past 10 years, through the Bali Democracy Forum, Indonesia has also shared the experiences and best practices of its democracy, working to strengthen democracy in its wider region. Furthermore, development must not be achieved at the expense of the environment. Despite the sceptics, climate change is real. It is happening as we speak. Like many small island developing States, Indonesia, with more than 17,000 islands, is experiencing changing weather patterns and rising sea levels. That will affect the sustainability of our development and even our survival. Indonesia is therefore fully committed to the Paris Agreement. We call on all countries to implement their obligations under the Agreement. One of the greatest challenges to our global order and development agenda is the threat of terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism. The threat is real, imminent and ever-present. Terrorism undermines peace and disrupts development. Therefore, my third point concerns the urgent need for global action and partnership in combating terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism. The key to tackling terrorism is to address its root causes: extreme poverty, illiteracy and massive youth unemployment. In most cases, radicalism and terrorism take hold of young, angry men, who think they have no hope because their country is destroyed, in combination with authoritarian Governments and invasions of big countries. In Indonesia, we have adopted a comprehensive approach to addressing terrorism, radicalism and violent extremism in the form of a seamless combination of using hard and soft powers and strengthening law enforcement and the rule of law. At the same time, we are fostering engagement with communities through education, empowerment and interfaith and cultural dialogue. Indonesia has also implemented a comprehensive programme for the deradicalization and reintegration of those who have been radicalized or gone to the dark side. We have deradicalized more than 1,600 extremists in over 72 prisons in Indonesia. In this digital age of social media, terrorism is like cancer; it spreads quickly and it is deadly. No one country can address it in isolation. Global cooperation and a comprehensive approach are the only panacea to eradicate the threat. As global challenges become more complex, it is evident that unilateralism is not a sustainable solution. The world needs strong partnership â?? a true global partnership. Indonesia has long believed in such partnership. That belief stems from our embedded national slogan â??Bersatu kita teguh bercerai kita runtuhâ??, which translates as â??united we stand, divided we fallâ??. Indonesia has always desired to contribute to global partnership, global peace and security, and global prosperity. Indonesia has presented its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2019-2020. Indonesia is a true partner for world peace. We are counting on the support of those present for our candidacy.",1,196
7779,Session 72 - 2017,IND_72_2017.txt,IND_72_2017,72,2017,IND,"Let me begin by offering my heartiest congratulations to Foreign Minister LajÄ?Ã¡k on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. For those of us fortunate enough to represent our nations as Foreign Minister, it is a particularly happy event that one of us has this honour. I addressed the Assembly last year as well (see A/71/PV.22). This year has seen much change both in the Assembly and the world it represents. We have a new Secretary-General at the United Nations who is determined to prepare and strengthen the United Nations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. We welcome his efforts and see in him a leader who can give practical shape to a vision. Our world today is trapped in a deluge of troubles of which the most dangerous is surely the relentless rise of violence. The evil of terrorism and the ideas that provoke it are spreading like wildfire. Climate change stares us in the face, and its threat is growing. Maritime security is an increasing worry. For many compelling and terrible reasons, people are leaving the psychological, cultural and economic comfort of their homes to seek refuge on distant shores, giving rise to global anxiety. A large part of the worldâ??s population still suffers from hunger and poverty. Young people are beginning to lose hope as they confront unemployment. Women, historically the victims of discrimination, are demanding what they should have â?? gender empowerment. The danger of nuclear proliferation is back in the headlines. Cybersecurity has become a source of deep insecurity. In 2015, we set ourselves the target date of 2030 for finding solutions to many of the challenges on our agenda. Two of those years have already passed. Surely it is already time to ask how much has happened. If complacency ends up defining the next 13 years, we will be in danger of losing control. We need a sense of urgency, as well as unshakable fortitude, if we are to take the decisions that can avert catastrophe. I am pleased that India has displayed the courage and leadership needed to take such tough decisions and launch its interlinked process of sustainable development. My Governmentâ??s most important priority is the complete eradication of poverty, and there are two ways of addressing that curse. The traditional method is through incremental levels of aid and hand-holding, but our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen the more radical route, through economic empowerment. The poor are not helpless; we have merely denied them opportunity. We are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. We are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers. All of our economic programmes have one main purpose â?? empowering the poor. Jan Dhan, Mudra, Ujjwala, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India â?? describing them all would take more time than I have at my disposal. I shall therefore dwell only on three core programmes. The Jan Dhan plan must surely count as the worldâ??s largest financial inclusion scheme. Those who had no money were able to open bank accounts with no balance. No other country in the world has enabled even those with no money to have a bank account and passbook. That impossibility has now become possible in India. At least 300 million Indians â?? almost the equivalent of the population of the United States â?? who had never crossed the threshold of a bank now have bank accounts. That was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks have achieved that visionary goal set by our Prime Minister. While some have still to be included, the target has been set. Every Indian family will have a bank account. Mudra Yojana has enabled the Government to fund the unfunded. Today, through Mudra, people who had never dreamt that bank credit could be an option for them are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro-businesses. I am particularly pleased to be able to say that 70 per cent of those loans have gone to women. Unemployment spreads despair. Through Skill India, Start-Up India and Stand-Up India, poor and middle-class youth are being trained to match their talents with bank credit and become self-employed as small-scale entrepreneurs. Ujjwala is one of the Governmentâ??s signature schemes. Poor women who had to work hard in the kitchen were sometimes left blinded by the smoke from their stoves. The poor are being provided with free gas cylinders so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. Uniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core of that programme. Demonetization was a courageous decision to challenge the black money that disappeared from circulation and was one of the by-products of corruption. India has now also passed legislation for a goods and services tax under which there is one tax throughout the country, without the disorganized and punishing system of multiple taxes under different categories in different parts of the country. Our Save the Girl, Educate the Girl campaign is reducing gender inequality. Our Clean India programme is generating what can only be described as a revolutionary change in social attitudes and habits. At this point, I would like to note that nations with rising capabilities can generate these kinds of change, but the developed world must become an active partner in helping vulnerable countries that are still mired in stagnant poverty to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) horizon by 2030. That is why the principle of global partnership was included in the SDGs. I am happy to report that this year India has launched an India-United Nations Development Partnership Fund. Regrettably, while we are fully engaged in fighting poverty, our neighbour Pakistan seems to be engaged only in fighting us. On Thursday, from this rostrum, Pakistanâ??s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi wasted rather too much of his speech (see A/72/PV.14) complaining about us, accusing India of State-sponsored terrorism and violations of human rights. Those listening had only one comment to make â?? â??Look who is talking.â?? The country that has been the worldâ??s greatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity has become a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about humanity and human rights from this rostrum. Pakistanâ??s Prime Minister claimed that his nationâ??s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, bequeathed a foreign policy based on peace and friendship. I would like to remind him that while it remains open to question whether Mr. Jinnah actually advocated such principles, what is beyond doubt is that from the moment Indiaâ??s Prime Minister Modi took his oath of office, he has extended the hand of peace and friendship, and Pakistanâ??s Prime Minister must answer why his nation has spurned that offer. Prime Minister Abbasi recalled old decisions that have long been overtaken by events, but his memory conveniently failed him where it matters. He has forgotten that under the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, India and Pakistan resolved to settle all outstanding disputes and issues bilaterally. The reality is that Pakistanâ??s politicians remember everything but conveniently manipulate those memories. They are masters at forgetting facts that undermine their version of events. Pakistanâ??s Prime Minister spoke of a comprehensive dialogue between our two countries. I would like to remind him that on 9 December 2015, when I was in Islamabad for the Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference, a decision was made by his leader, Mian Nawaz Sharif, then still Prime Minister, to renew dialogue between us through what he called a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. The word â??bilateralâ?? was used consciously to remove any confusion or doubt about the fact that the proposed talks would be between our two nations and only our two nations, without any third party present. Mr. Abbasi must answer why that proposal withered, because Pakistan is responsible for aborting that peace process. I would just like to ask Pakistanâ??s politicians why it is that although India and Pakistan became free within hours of each other, today India is recognized as an information-technology super-Power and Pakistan only as a pre-eminent exporter of terrorism? Have they ever thought about what the reason for that might be? There is only one reason for it. India has risen despite being the principal destination for Pakistanâ??s nefarious export of terrorism. There have been many Governments under many parties during the 70 years of Indian freedom, because India has maintained its democracy. Every Government has done its bit for Indiaâ??s development. We have marched ahead consistently, without pause, creating integrated management systems, education and technology services and AIMS foundations in education, health, space and the entire range of human welfare. We have established scientific and technical institutions that are the pride of the world. But what has Pakistan offered the world or, indeed, its own people, apart from terrorism? We have produced scholars, doctors, engineers and scientists. It has produced terrorists and terrorist camps â?? Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen and the Haqqani Network. What has Pakistan created? It has created terrorists and jihadists. Doctors save people from death; terrorists send them to their death. Pakistanâ??s terrorist organizations are not only attacking India, they are also affecting two of our neighbours, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. In the history of the General Assembly, it may be a first that a country has asked for a right of reply in order to respond to the statements of three different countries. Does that simple fact not illustrate the reality of Pakistanâ??s actions? If Pakistan had spent on development what it has spent on developing terror, both it and the world would be safer and better off today. Terrorism is at the very top of the list of problems to which the United Nations is searching for solutions. We are the oldest victim of this terrible, even traumatic terrorism. When we first began pointing to this menace, many of the worldâ??s great Powers dismissed it as a law-and-order issue. Now they know better. The question is what we do about it. We must all look within ourselves and ask whether the action we are taking even approaches the level of our talk about it. In bilateral and multilateral discussions we all condemn this evil and piously declare our determination to fight it. The truth is that these statements have become rituals. The fact is that when we are required to fight and destroy this enemy, the self-interest of some makes them duplicitous. That has been going on for years. Although India had proposed a comprehensive convention on international terrorism as early as 1996, two decades later the United Nations has not been able to agree on a definition of terrorism. If we cannot agree on a definition of our enemy, how can we fight together? If we continue to differentiate between good terrorists and bad, how can we fight together? If even the Security Council cannot agree on the listing of terrorists, how can we fight together? In all sincerity, I would like to ask the Assembly, through you, Madam, to stop seeing this evil with self- defeating, indeed meaningless nuance. Evil is evil. Let us accept that terrorism is an existential danger to humankind. There is absolutely no justification for such barbaric violence. Let us display our new commitment by reaching an agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism this year. I have identified climate change as one of the significant dangers to our existence. India has already said that it is deeply committed to the Paris Climate Change Agreement. That is not because we are afraid of any Power, influenced by friend or foe or tempted by some imagined greed. It is an outcome of a philosophy that is at least 5,000 years old. Our Prime Minister has, on his personal initiative, launched the International Solar Alliance as witness to our abiding commitment to this cause. When we talk of world peace, we mean peace not only among human beings but also with nature. We understand that human nature is sometimes inimical to nature, but we would like to amend human nature when it tends in the wrong directions. When we inflict our greed on nature, nature sometimes explodes. We must learn to live with the imperatives, cycles and creative urges of nature. In that lies our own salvation. We have just witnessed hurricanes and earthquakes, rains that inundate and storms that terrify. That is not mere coincidence. Through Hurricane Harvey, Nature sent its warning to the world even before the worldâ??s leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York. After our gathering had already begun, an earthquake struck Mexico and a hurricane landed in Dominica. We must understand that this requires more serious action, not more talk. The countries of the developed world must listen more carefully than others, because they have more capacities than others. The developed world must help the less fortunate through technology transfer and Green Climate Fund financing. That is the only way to safeguard future generations. We have been discussing turmoil and change around the world, but the one Organization created to address world affairs is beset by its own problems. It seems to believe that there is no need for it to make changes in the precepts and perceptions that brought about its birth. On 18 September, I participated in a meeting in New York on United Nations reform and witnessed a clear desire for change and action. But I should also remind the Assembly that at the 2005 World Summit there was a consensus that reforming the Security Council as soon as possible was an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations. Efforts to conduct text-based negotiations on reforming and expanding the Security Council were initiated during last yearâ??s session, and more than 160 nations expressed support for them. If we are serious, the least we can do is to produce one text that can be the basis for negotiation. I hope that under the enlightened leadership of the new President of the General Assembly this will become a priority. If it does, that will be a significant achievement. We also have high expectations of the new Secretary- General. If he wants to reform the Organizationâ??s peace and security architecture, he will also have to address the reforms related to United Nations peacekeeping that have long been demanded. Without such improvements, it will be impossible for him to achieve that goal. There is no shortage of issues and problems that should be acknowledged from this rostrum. But time is not always on the side of those who would like to raise issues and problems in the interests of a better, more peaceful and progressive future. The issues that the President of the General Assembly has chosen are relevant to the Charter of the United Nations as well as to the ancient traditions of my land. My countryâ??s culture and thought have been shaped by a history and philosophy that believes in peace as humankindâ??s only rational and practical objective. We truly believe that the world is one family, and we hope that every member of this family deserves that elixir of life that is happiness. Let me end by reciting a verse that is a synthesis of our thought: â??May all be happy; may all be healthy; may all see what is good; may all be free from sufferingâ??.",1,196
7780,Session 72 - 2017,IRL_72_2017.txt,IRL_72_2017,72,2017,IRL,"Allow me to begin by offering Irelandâ??s sympathy to all those in Mexico affected by the devastating earthquake earlier this week and to commend those who have been engaged in the heroic rescue operations of the last few days. I also want to extend condolences to the representatives of people in the Caribbean islands, who are facing extraordinary difficulties following the recent, relentless hurricanes. Now is no time for business as usual at the United Nations. The international community is facing unprecedented challenges and must respond. I am here because I think that this Organization matters. It is an Organization that now faces daily challenges to its political authority and management missions. My country, Ireland, has kept faith with the United Nations since we joined as a young republic that had fought hard for its own independence and saw being a Member of the United Nation as fundamental to its future and the future security of its people. Over 60 years later, we still do. Our faith has not been misplaced, and it is as strong today as ever. However, we certainly have something to say about the future of the Organization and the role we believe it must play in reducing suffering across the globe and securing a shared peace and security and prosperity for everybody. Given our history as a small country, with its own troubled past, we see very clearly the advantages of a rules-based order in international affairs. It is because Ireland is small, outward-looking and heavily dependent on external trade for our own well-being that we pursue an active foreign policy. As Irelandâ??s experience in the European Union has shown us, we are far stronger acting collectively than we are acting alone. Partnership and cooperation has brought peace and prosperity to the European continent. In fact, for Ireland, our membership of the European Union, working closely with other member States, has strengthened our independence and self- confidence and security rather than diminished it. It is therefore through collective actions that we reinforce our own security and well-being, which is what the United Nations needs to be all about. The case for international cooperation and multilateralism is compelling. By working together, we lay foundations of trust, align our perspectives more closely and accept our differences more willingly. Perhaps most importantly, we build habits of cooperation that better allow us to address the common threats and opportunities that we should be facing together.The alternatives â?? unilateralism, transactional diplomacy, protectionism and confrontation â?? are not, in fact, viable at all. Their short-term populist appeal obscures their long-term cost. Surely we have learned that from history. We are living in an era when local and global challenges are intersecting with increasing force. Todayâ??s problems do not carry passports or recognize international borders. There are no unilateral solutions to the vast majority of the global challenges that we face together. Local and regional issues, from climate change, migration, armed conflict and hunger to the destruction of the marine environment in certain parts of the world, often become global issues, including in corners of the world that are far from the origins of the problems. The enormous scale of the challenges that face the world might lead some to question whether multilateralism and the United Nations are up to the task. My response is that we can be, and we must be. When properly mobilized, when we pull together and move from debating halls like this Hall to actually getting things done on the ground, we can move mountains together. The United Nations delivers extraordinary results, such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The United Nations has led the global effort to eradicate smallpox, end apartheid, promote arms control, save the lives of millions of children through UNICEF and protect our cultural heritage through UNESCO. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a stand-out recent achievement. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have the power and potential to transform our world, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality and instability. However, their potential can be realized only through a strong and confident multilateral system that empowers Member States to reach the ambitious but necessary targets we have set ourselves. Having played an important role in facilitating agreement on the SDGs in 2015, Ireland is committed to their implementation, domestically and through our foreign policy. Failure should not be an option here. The United Nations is the fulcrum upon which we can leverage the change required. However, the walls dividing the three pillars of the United Nations â?? development, human rights, and peace and security â?? have in the past impeded our efforts to accelerate sustainable development. In my view, the SDGs represent a fundamental breakthrough, recognizing the many aspects of sustainable development that straddle those pillars. As we move forward on implementation, we must break down the Organizationâ??s institutional silos, which sometimes hinder progress. Since we gathered here a year ago, we appointed AntÃ³nio Guterres as Secretary-General. Ireland believes that he has the skills, experience and, perhaps most importantly, the compassion to do a very tough but hugely important job. The difficult international environment demands, more than ever, brave and principled leadership. We welcome the clear direction the Secretary-General is providing and the steps he is taking to reform the Organization. While we, the Member States, have expressed confidence that the Secretary-General has the abilities to lead the United Nations forward at a time when the world is crying out for better multilateral engagement, we must allow him to lead. It is very tempting for Member States, particularly large ones, to micromanage the work of the Secretariat, but such an approach is likely to impede and not enhance reform. However, it is not enough that only the internal mechanisms of the United Nations meet twenty-first century standards. United Nations political bodies must also reflect todayâ??s world and realities. Nowhere is that more evident than with regard to the composition of the Security Council. The Security Council does not reflect the world that has evolved since the United Nations was established in 1945. Quite plainly, we would be hard pressed to find any entity, public or private, anywhere in the world that remains so untouched by the changes and realities of the world around it. Vast areas of our world are either insufficiently represented or not represented at all on the Security Council. In our view, the need to increase the size of the Council is clear. Ireland sees the obvious need for a much stronger African representation on the Council, so that there can be a greater African say in the Council decisions that affect their continent. We would also favour consideration of a designated seat for small island developing States. Those changes are politically controversial, but we cannot ignore them forever. The makeup of the Security Council is not the only problem. Let us be clear and honest. While the use or threat of the veto remains in place, as it does today, the work of the Council is often impeded and the United Nations can be paralysed in its capacity to respond to the gravest crises facing the international community. The failure of the Security Council to take action in preventing mass atrocity crimes â?? most recently with regard to Syria, but also on other occasions â?? betrays victims and weakens the credibility of the Organization. The case for reform is therefore not an academic or institutional question; it is a deeper question of fundamental legitimacy and effectiveness and credibility for the United Nations in the future. Although geographically a small island on the periphery of Europe, Irelandâ??s people and its outlook are global, influenced by connecting with people and events around the world, as we do. In many ways Ireland, like some of the other nations represented here, is like a global tribe that extends far beyond our own island. No part of our contribution to the United Nations resonates more with Irish people than our United Nations peacekeepers â?? the thousands of men and women who have served under Blue Helmets, representing Ireland, our people and values. They are true ambassadors. Since 1958, when Irish troops first began serving the United Nations, not a single day has passed without Irish participation in United Nations peace-support operations. We believe that we are making a difference. Irelandâ??s peacekeepers have been natural soldier-diplomats in trouble spots across the globe, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, doing United Nations work day by day and deed by deed. Today, we have almost 550 troops in the field. Ireland is the highest per capita European Union contributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping, with deployments to six United Nations missions across the Middle East and Africa. We are making a substantial contribution to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in particular, where, as always, our peacekeepers act with impartiality and integrity and provide the necessary leadership required in a very difficult and challenging environment. I am pleased to note that Ireland is committed to doubling the number of women in our defence forces â?? I was the Minister for Defence when that decision was made â?? with the aim also of significantly increasing female participation in peacekeeping, a demand of the Secretary-General. As the Secretary-General said at the Security Council this week (see S/PV.8051), and as we know from the women and peace and security agenda, increased female participation leads to better decision-making, improved situational awareness, a better focus on protection of civilians and enhanced reporting of and accountability for sexual exploitation and abuse. We all know that conflict prevention has the potential to save lives and to protect hard-won development gains, and that it comes at a far lower financial cost than peacekeeping operations, post- conflict peacebuilding or, in some cases, State-building. We strongly support the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts to reorient the international communityâ??s thinking toward crisis and conflict prevention. Ireland seeks to share our own national experience and past in our work on conflict prevention, mediation and State-building. We have made some mistakes, but we have also had successes, and we would like others to share the lessons from that experience. As the first State to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in 1968, we have a deep commitment to its full implementation. Earlier this week I was very pleased to sign the recently approved Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was supported by 122 members of this Assembly, and growing. Ireland is proud to have played a leadership role, together with Austria, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa, in bringing forward the Assembly resolution convening the diplomatic conference that negotiated this ground-breaking treaty. The case for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons has never been stronger, as the volatile situation on the Korean peninsula makes very clear this week. I unreservedly condemn the recent series of missile and nuclear weapons testing by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. These developments highlight the urgent need for the swift and immediate entry into force of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. I understand that I will be followed today on this rostrum by the representative of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic, and I would urge him to de-escalate the provocative language and tensions of this week. This is a conflict that the world does not need and must move away from. The scale and severity of humanitarian crises is one of the greatest challenges facing the international community. Ireland is committed to providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to international efforts to ease the plight of civilians caught in conflicts in South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, to name but a few. As those large-scale crises dominate the headlines, Ireland is conscious of the many forgotten or underfunded crises and the need to maintain a focus on ensuring that human suffering, wherever it occurs in the world, is not ignored. The vast majority of displaced people are being sheltered in communities that are already experiencing high levels of vulnerability and poverty, placing a huge strain on already limited resources. Therefore Ireland is supporting both refugees and vulnerable host communities on the basis of need. I particularly want to acknowledge the generosity of so many States â?? such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and many more â?? that are hosting very large numbers of people displaced by conflicts in neighbouring countries. Ireland is proud of its strong and targeted contribution to eradicating global hunger, reducing extreme poverty, addressing conflict and instability and responding to humanitarian crises wherever they occur. It is horrifying to think that in 2017 we have four famines affecting more than 20 million people, 70 per cent of whom are children, and that we as an international community have allowed that to happen, knowing that it was on the way. For Ireland, strong partnerships, especially with least developed countries, will remain at the core of our approach as we work together for a peaceful and prosperous future. We applaud the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts to enhance coherence, effectiveness and accountability, as well as the delivery of results where it matters most â?? which is on the ground. The Charter of the United Nations does not begin â??We the Member Statesâ?? but rather â??We the peoplesâ??. Our policies and actions must reflect the inherent equality of humankind at the core of our multilateral system. In practice, that means listening to and heeding the voices of women, the voices of young people and the voices of the marginalized. The women and peace and security agenda has had a hugely positive global impact with the realization that we can create more durable and sustainable peace by working to ensure that women play their rightful role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts. Ireland will play our part, including as Chair of the Commission on the Status of Women for the next two years. A similar strategic approach must also be taken in engaging young people in all our countries. Young people must have a role in shaping a future that they will ultimately inherit; otherwise, we are, on a generational basis, robbing a future from them. We have a phrase in Irish that the interpreters will not be able to translate: â??Mol an Ã³ige agus tiocfaidh sÃ­â??. Broadly translated, this means â??Praise the youth and they will comeâ??. I cannot think of any continent where that is more relevant today than Africa. Young people are key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and we must find ways to encourage their active participation, again and again and again, ensuring that they are part of shaping the solutions for their future. There are positive signs: the vitality of entrepreneurship, the creative use of technology, infrastructure development, the potential of renewable energy, increasing access to good education, improvements in agricultural yields, adding value to commodities, and better prospects for women and girls in politics and economic life. African countries are particularly affected by global challenges that lie outside their control in many ways, such as climate change, conflict and food insecurity. Those issues can be addressed only in their African contexts, in a spirit of effective global partnership. Such partnership requires understanding local perspectives anchored in local experience, particularly regarding how to tackle root causes. I want Ireland to play a leading role in Europe in helping to build better and more effective partnerships with the continent of Africa as a whole, rooted in shared interests and values and sustained over the medium to long term on the basis of parity of esteem and equality. We need a new political architecture, in my view, for the relationship between the European Union and Africa, one that matches the urgency and scale of the shared challenges we know we are going to face over the next twenty years. We are in the same global neighbourhood, and we need to put structures in place to treat each other as true neighbours. The Middle East is also part of Europeâ??s close neighbourhood, and its challenges resonate deeply with the people of Ireland. The conflicts in Syria and Yemen have caused untold suffering. Ireland has responded as generously as we can with almost â?¬100 million in humanitarian aid, but what the people of Syria and Yemen need most right now is peace to enable them to rebuild their lives and start the process of rebuilding their countries. I urge all sides in the two conflicts to work for an end to violence and to engage in the search for peaceful political solutions under United Nations auspices and for accountability for crimes committed. Ireland is committed to constructive and principled diplomatic action on the Middle East peace process. Next year will be the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo Accords. We cannot let ourselves become complacent about the status quo because the status quo is not acceptable, and we know where it is going. We cannot let our efforts to achieve peace stagnate either. Palestinians need an end to occupation, and Israelis need security. Continued construction of settlements undermines both objectives, and we need to act on that. I wish the United States success in its efforts to build some momentum for peace and a new peace initiative for the first time in quite some time. Ireland will give all the support it can to achieving a two-State solution, which we remain convinced is the only way to secure prosperity and security for both peoples. The time to act on this is now. We cannot become cynical or jaded. We owe it to all Palestinians and Israelis to continue to bring energy, resolve and ideas to the table and help them finally deliver a lasting peace, which would not only be good for both of those peoples, but also a welcome, if not a desperately needed, positive news story for the broader Middle East as well. In relation to Myanmar, Ireland strongly condemns the violence in Rakhine state that has driven hundreds of thousands from their homes into neighbouring Bangladesh. Here at the General Assembly we have to insist on an end to violence, to the upholding of the rule of law and the recognition of the right of return of all those who have been forced to leave their country. I know the situation is difficult â?? my friend from Singapore has highlighted its complexities â?? but we have to ensure that standards are met. Ireland sees itself as a natural child of the United Nations. We are small. We are an island that has experienced colonization and conflict, as many of us here have also done. But here at the United Nations, we listen to others, especially if we hold a different view on an issue or a policy. We are convinced that in todayâ??s globalized world we must live in each otherâ??s shelter and not in each otherâ??s shadow. Irelandâ??s contribution to the United Nations in the fields of sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disarmament, human rights and the rule of law has been steadfast. United Nations membership has been and will continue to be at the very heart of Irish foreign policy. Ireland is proud to be a candidate for a seat on the Security Council in the elections to be held in 2020. We have presented our candidature because we believe deeply that we should step forward and play our part in support of multilateralism at a time of significant global instability and realignment of geopolitical influences. We have something to say, and we will listen to others when they speak. We will be courageous on behalf of the United Nations when needed. With Ireland, the world knows what it gets â?? a small country with big thinking, a country that listens and a strong independent voice that promotes the values that should inspire the Organization in future.",1,196
7781,Session 72 - 2017,IRN_72_2017.txt,IRN_72_2017,72,2017,IRN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate Secretary-General Guterres on his appointment to his high office and to wish him every success in his crucial responsibilities. Four months ago, more than 41 million people â?? 73 per cent of the total of Iranâ??s eligible voters â?? came to the polls in our countryâ??s twelfth presidential election and once again expressed confidence in my platform, which calls for moderation and respect for human rights, prosperity and economic revitalization at home, and for constructive engagement around the world. Their vote illustrated the maturity of the electorate in a society that has been experiencing free and democratic governance for only four decades. Our latest election was not merely a vote for a President. It represents a huge political investment on the part of our resilient people, who truly constitute our most reliable asset. Human and civil rights, along with a quest for justice and Islamic values, have been at the heart of the principal demands of the Iranian people for their more than 150 years of struggle, particularly during the Islamic revolution of 1979. In its first term, while pursuing nuclear negotiations internationally, at home my Government focused on discussing and articulating our citizensâ?? rights, resulting in the promulgation of a Citizensâ?? Rights Charter and its adoption for implementation, thereby meeting the demands of a people who, in their desire to restore their rights and human dignity, first rose up against a dictatorial regime 111 years ago, in their constitutional revolution, and again 39 years ago, in the Islamic revolution. I declare here in this Hall that moderation is the preferred and chosen path of the great Iranian people. Moderation seeks neither isolation nor hegemony. It implies neither indifference nor intransigence. The path of moderation is the path of peace. That peace is a just and inclusive peace, not one that means peace for one nation and war and turmoil for others. Moderation is freedom and democracy, conducted in an inclusive and comprehensive manner that does not purport to promote freedom in one place while supporting dictators elsewhere. Moderation is the synergy of ideas, not a dance of swords. And lastly, the path of moderation nurtures beauty. Exports of deadly weapons are not beautiful. Peace is beautiful. In Iran, we strive to build peace and promote the human rights of peoples and nations. We never condone tyranny and we always defend those whose voices are not heard. But while we never threaten anyone, neither do we tolerate threats from anyone. Our discourse is based on dignity and respect, and we are unmoved by threats and intimidation. We believe in dialogue and negotiation conducted on an equal footing and based on mutual respect. In todayâ??s globalized world, peace, security, stability and the progress of all nations are intertwined. We cannot see a rogue and racist regime trample on the most basic rights of Palestinians while the usurpers of their land enjoy security. No one can aspire to long-term stability, prosperity and development while Muslims in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Myanmar and so many other places live in misery, war and poverty. Throughout its history, Iran has been a bastion of tolerance for many religions and ethnicities. We are the same people who rescued the Jews from Babylonian servitude, opened our arms to welcome Armenian Christians in our midst and created the Iranian cultural continent with a unique mix of diverse religions and ethnicities. I represent the same Iran that has historically assisted the oppressed. Centuries ago, we supported the rights of the Jewish people and today we are insisting on the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people. Iran is still the same country, supporting justice and seeking tranquillity. Today we are on the front lines fighting terror and religious extremism in the Middle East, not for sectarian or ethnic reasons but for ethical, humanitarian and strategic ones. Iran does not seek to restore its ancient empire, impose its official religion on others or export its revolution through the force of arms. We have enough confidence in the depth of our culture, the truth of our faith and the tenacity and longevity of our revolution that we will never seek to export any of them in the way that neocolonialists do through the heavy boots of soldiers. To promote our culture, civilization, religion and revolution, we enter hearts and engage minds. We recite our poetry and engage in discourse on our philosophy. Our ambassadors are our poets, mystics and philosophers. We have reached these shores of the Atlantic through Rumi and spread our influence all over Asia with Saadi. We have already captured the world through Hafez, so we are not in need of new conquests. The call for moderation is from a nation that has been committed to it. We do not preach moderation; we practice it, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a case in point. The deal is the outcome of two years of intensive multilateral negotiations, overwhelmingly applauded by the international community and endorsed by the Security Council through resolution 2231 (2015). As such, it belongs to the entire international community, not just one or two countries. The JCPOA can become a new model for global interaction based on mutual constructive engagement among us all. We have opened our doors to engagement and cooperation and concluded scores of development agreements with advanced countries in both the East and the West. Unfortunately, there are some who have deprived themselves of that unique opportunity, in a way that amounts to imposing sanctions on themselves, and now they feel betrayed. We were not deceived, and neither did we cheat or deceive anyone else. We determined the extent of our nuclear programme ourselves. We never sought to achieve deterrence through nuclear weapons. We have immunized ourselves through our peopleâ??s knowledge and, more importantly, their resilience. That is our talent and our approach. Some say that they wanted to deprive Iran of nuclear weapons, but we have always vociferously rejected such weapons. We have never been distressed about forgoing an option that we never actually sought. It is reprehensible that a rogue Zionist regime that threatens regional and global security with its nuclear arsenal and is not committed to any international instrument or safeguard has the audacity to preach to peaceful nations. Imagine how the Middle East would look if the JCPOA had not been concluded. Imagine that along with civil wars, takfiri terror, humanitarian nightmares and complex sociopolitical crises in West Asia there was a manufactured nuclear crisis. How would we all fare? I declare here to the Assembly that while the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the first country to violate the agreement, it will respond decisively and resolutely to any violation of it by any party. It would be a great pity if it were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics, and the world would have lost a great opportunity. But such unfortunate behaviour will never halt Iran in its course of progress and advancement. By violating its international commitments, the new United States Administration only destroys its own credibility and undermines international confidence in negotiating with it or accepting its promises. Four years ago in the Assembly, the Islamic Republic of Iran sponsored the initiative of resolution 68/127, â??A world against violence and violent extremismâ??. We consider dialogue and negotiations based on a positive-sum paradigm to be the only path to resolving global and regional crises. We have made a conscious decision to strengthen relations with our neighbours and others in the region, as well as to enhance our cooperation with all friendly countries. We cannot navigate the complex and dangerous challenges in this turbulent transitional global phase without expanding interaction and exchanges and institutionalizing dialogue between nations and States. The ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric filled with ridiculously baseless allegations that we heard yesterday in this Hall was not only unfit to be heard at the United Nations â?? which was established to promote peace and respect between nations â?? but in fact contradicted the demands of the nations of this global Organization that it bring Governments together in the battle against war and terror. I wish to emphasize that the defence capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including its missiles, are solely defensive deterrents for maintaining regional peace and stability and suppressing the adventurist tendencies of irrational aspirants. We cannot forget that civilians in many of our cities became the target of long-range missile attacks by Saddam Hussein during his eight-year war of aggression against us. We will never allow our people to become victims of such catastrophic delusions again. Instability and extremist violence have only been exacerbated in our region through the military interventions of extra-regional actors â?? the same Powers that try to sell ever more of their deadly weapons to other States by accusing Iran of fomenting instability. I want to emphasize that foreign intervention and the imposition of alien wishes on the people of the region can only widen and deepen the crises in our region. The crises in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain do not have military solutions and can be resolved only through an end to the hostilities and acceptance of the will and desires of their peoples. The United States Government should explain to its own people why, after spending billions of dollars of the assets of the people of America and our region, it has brought the region only war, misery, poverty and the rise of terrorism and extremism rather than contributing to peace and stability. In the past four years, Iran has demonstrated that its economy has unparalleled potential for expansion and growth. Economic sanctions not only have not hindered it, they have solidified the popular resolve to enhance domestic production. Iranâ??s achievement of the highest global growth rate last year proved that its economy has the potential to become the worldâ??s most vibrant emerging economy within the next 20 years, with a trillion-dollar growth potential. Our strategic choice for achieving such sustainable and balanced growth is an extensive network of global partnerships. We firmly believe that development and security can grow only if they grow together, and that common interests can bind us regionally and globally to guarantee both regional and global security. Iran, with the worldâ??s largest gas and oil reserves, is prepared to engage in long-term cooperation to advance global energy security. We are eager to expand international transit corridors through joint ventures in sea, rail and road infrastructure projects. Our achievements in enhancing economic infrastructures through a nation-wide gas pipeline, a national electricity grid and rail and road transport have made it possible for various industries to produce their goods at a lower cost, with easy access to national and regional markets. With our current friendly legal environment, many foreign investors have come to Iran, leading to an ever-increasing number of investments, joint ventures and financing agreements in multiple fields. It is the policy of my Government to continue to steadily enhance the entrepreneurial environment, protect intellectual property rights, consistently improve corporate governance and engage in a robust campaign against money-laundering in order to enhance a legal climate conducive to business and economic investments in various fields, particularly knowledge-based enterprises. The Iranian nation is resolutely determined to build a free and advanced Iran and participate in developing a secure and stable region based on ethics and respect for international law. In that endeavour, we welcome the participation and cooperation of all investors, intellectuals and innovators from all over the world. From this global rostrum, and as the representative of the people of Iran, who are world-famous for their hospitality, I invite all who seek peace, security and progress through partnership and cooperation among nations to visit Iran and join us in building this future of hope. If we truly believe in our collective decision of four years ago in the General Assembly to work for a world against violence and violent extremism, we can turn the discourse of imposition, unilateralism, intimidation and war into the logic of dialogue, synergy and peace, so that moderation can become the dominant voice across the globe.",1,196
7782,Session 72 - 2017,IRQ_72_2017.txt,IRQ_72_2017,72,2017,IRQ,"My delegation first wishes to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k upon his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We also congratulate the Republic of Slovakia and wish Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k the greatest success in this role. We also thank his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his efforts and wise leadership in guiding the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We wish to express our condolences to the victims of the natural disasters that have struck the United States of America, Mexico and other States in the Caribbean region. The heroic Iraqi forces won a historic victory that put an end to the myth of the extremist-terrorist State in Mosul. Through their great sacrifices and with the assistance of brother countries, the valiant Iraqi forces recaptured the city of Mosul. The Iraqi Armed Forces are fighting several towns, including Tal Afar, which has just been liberated. They have also contributed, through all their branches, to shutting down all terrorist hotbeds in certain other Iraqi cities, such as Hawija. I therefore wish today to congratulate our Armed Forces and our proud people who made many sacrifices. I hail all honourable members of the civilized world who supported Iraq and its brave forces in the fight against the terrorist bands from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, also known as Daâ??esh. We scored a major victory without shirking our duty to protect civilians, who were used as human shields by terrorists, or failing to respect the unity, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iraq. All branches of the Iraqi Armed Forces, the Iraqi police, the Popular Mobilization Forces, the Peshmerga forces and other anti-terrorist forces contributed to this historic victory. It is also a victory for the entire world. Even though the war had been raging in Iraq, it affected a vast number peaceful of citizens in some 120 other States. History teaches us that post-conflict periods can be even more challenging than wartime. Indeed, efforts to restore stability, undertake reconstruction and resurrect hope after the liberation of Iraqi cities, through great sacrifices on the humanitarian and development fronts and the environment, which deteriorated badly. Moreover, Daâ??esh also conducted environmental terrorism by setting fire to oil wells, destroying small dams and flooding agricultural lands. It has also destroyed our cultural heritage sites. Today, Iraq is entering a new phase in its just fight against Daâ??esh bands to respond to the challenges of the post-Daâ??esh period, including the financial challenges of lower oil prices on international markets. We have developed a comprehensive vision for our future that is based on social, economic and security priorities that serve Iraq and its citizens. This vision comprises the following main axes. First, we are restoring security, stability and basic services, allowing people to return to their homes and participate in the reconstruction of all that was destroyed by Daâ??esh, and caring for the families of the martyrs and victims who paid the ultimate price in defending our State. Also, we are caring for the victims of terrorism, rehabilitating societies so that no trace remains of Daâ??esh or the culture of hatred and violence, mobilizing all national efforts to achieve those national and humanitarian objectives. Second, we are ensuring respect and peaceful coexistence among all members of society, regardless of religion, ideology or intellectual affiliation. We have fostered a spirit of confidence and mutual trust among our citizens and are protecting minorities and houses of worship of all religions, which is the basis for social reconciliation. Third, we will prevent the return of the abnormal practices and phenomena that were present in Iraq before Daâ??esh took control of parts of the country, in particular, the sectarian and nationalist isolationism that were to detrimental to the best interests of the State. Such phenomena made it possible for Daâ??esh to take over cities and control governorates. We will appeal to the populationâ??s spirit of citizenship and desire for unity and cooperation, so that neither Daâ??esh nor any other terrorist organization can return to Iraq by giving coverage or protection in the areas we have retaken. Fourth, we believe that it is important to foster a spirit of good-neighbourliness based on the shared interests of all States and work according to our national will and independent decision-making. We will not give in to foreign pressure. Fifth, we will keep arms exclusively in the hands of our national security forces, putting an end to all armed incidents and reviving the rule of law in all sectors of the State. Sixth, we will continue our formidable fight against corruption in all of its forms and manifestations, because it is fertile ground for terrorism and crime. Seventh, State institutions must be sheltered from political interference and favouritism in order to foster justice and equal opportunities and to attract highly specialized professionals into the public- sector workforce. Iraq is a united, independent and sovereign federal State. It is a State based on a federal Constitution adopted in 2005 by Iraqis from all components of society in a transparent and democratic referendum that enjoyed a high degree of participation. The Constitution respects all rights and obligations of all components of Iraqi society and reinforces the value of citizen participation in democratic political processes and effective political representation in all ministries and independent bodies. Attention has been paid to making it possible for all parties concerned to exercise their rights and responsibilities and participate in political, social, cultural and linguistic events â?? something that is lacking in many ethnically and religiously diversified states. The Government of Iraq continues to encourage cohesiveness among all members of society. With regard to the relationship between the federal Government and the Regional Government of Kurdistan, the Government is promoting and will continue to promote constructive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues with the Regional Government of Kurdistan, without preconditions. We have not accepted the unconstitutional decision adopted by the Iraqi Kurdistan region, nor will we abandon Iraqâ??s unity, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. The National Assembly and its representatives, in the interests of Iraqâ??s unity, voted to reject the so-called referendum. It mandated the national Iraqi Government to take measures to preserve the countryâ??s unity and address the pending issue, based on Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the unity of Iraq is one and its sovereignty is indivisible. The Government, in conformity with its responsibilities, has asked the Supreme Court to issue an order rejecting the so-called referendum, which is supposed to be held in Kurdistan on 25 September. It is a violation of the Constitution, particularly with respect to the status of disputed regions characterized by multinationalism and a multi-religious frame of mind. In the first three months of next year, Iraq will organize legislative and parliamentary elections. All political forces in the country have already begun to prepare for these elections. Through this democratic process, Iraqâ??s pluralist political system will be strengthened, thereby ensuring the political stability that will protect Iraq against future crises. These successes will also make it possible to consolidate economic progress and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the country. With regard to our relations with the United Nations, we are working with all stakeholders to address pending issues in the Security Council, with a view to being released from the burden of commitments made by previous Iraqi Governments. We have done this gradually, duly respecting international obligations, so that Iraq can resume the status it had enjoyed before the adoption of resolution 661 (1990). Iraqâ??s deeply held sense of responsibility has included respecting Security Council resolutions on it and on relations between Iraq and Kuwait. We have taken all of the necessary measures to implement resolution 1958 (2010) on the Oil-for-Food Programme. We still face the issue of Kuwaitâ??s compensation. Negotiations with our Kuwaiti brothers have begun to settle the issue. On 21 September, the Security Council adopted the historic resolution 2379 (2017) to collect evidence on the criminal activities perpetrated by Daâ??esh in Iraq and other States. This resolution establishes a joint investigative mechanism that will comprise judges, prosecutors and Iraqiâ??s criminal experts, working with international experts to collect, compile and preserve evidence against Daâ??esh in Iraq. We are doing our utmost to ensure that Daâ??esh is brought to justice for the crimes it committed in Iraq, especially genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Resolution 2379 (2017) is based on the essential pillars of respect for Iraqi sovereignty and legal jurisdiction when it comes to the collection of evidence of crimes Daâ??esh has committed. We appeal to Member States to provide the necessary financial resources and other forms of support to the joint investigative team. From this rostrum, Iraq calls for assistance from kindred nuclear-power countries to build a nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes in our country. Iraq wishes to acquire nuclear technology and relaunch various technological sectors on the basis of the right of States to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which provides that States, particularly developing countries, have the inalienable right to pursue research and develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without any discrimination whatsoever. My countryâ??s Government takes note of the threats to peace, security, stability and development throughout the world, which calls for a dialogue between the various cultures and civilizations. Events in a number of geographic regions reaffirm the importance of reinforcing the culture of peace and strengthening its place on the General Assemblyâ??s agenda, especially since Member States have adopted Sustainable Development Goal 16, on peaceful and inclusive societies. Peaceful coexistence among peoples and communities cannot take place without tolerance, because tolerance is the surest way of establishing modern communities, strengthening social linkages and enriching exchanges among various societies. We cannot dispute the fact that the best way of re-establishing lasting peace and tolerance and for strengthening sustainable development is by ensuring that there are equal chances for everybody and a fair distribution of national resources, without discriminating on the basis of race or religion. Nor can we overlook the role of religious and social leaders to spread the culture of peace in our countries, for all religions call for peace and peaceful coexistence. In this regard, I would like to make reference to the role in Najaf of Mr. Al-Sistani, who contributed several times to putting an end to the divisions that had so severely affected Iraq. The adoption of the Takfiri school programme and the dissemination of erroneous Takfiri fatwas through the social media led to extremist intellectual and ideological aberrations that facilitated terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It imposed a set of mistaken ideas that threaten international peace and security and human civilization, hence the importance of working with UNESCO and other stakeholders to send a message that appropriate education is essential for spreading the values of tolerance and for rejecting extremism and violence. The Government of Iraq has made security efforts to re-establish peace and security by adopting a project for national reconciliation in order to strengthen cohesion and unity among the Iraqi people, entrench the principles of national unity, and create the appropriate conditions for love and harmony among all components of Iraqi society, while deepening the spirit of citizenship for the sake of the country. Accordingly, all Iraqis have an equal footing in society, free from any discrimination whatsoever, with a view to strengthening the sense of national unity, responding to challenges and providing the Iraqi people with everything they need to achieve development and prosperity. Our region has had to face great waves of displacement as a result of worsening crises that have led to the rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation of the displaced. Host countries are no longer able to provide sufficient assistance on their own. The crisis has become even more complex in Iraq because of the increased number of displaced Iraqis who fled areas that had been under Daâ??esh control, which is an additional burden for the people of Iraq, who are already suffering from a financial crisis stemming from the drop in oil prices and the growth of military spending to counter terrorism. We therefore reaffirm the importance of intensifying international efforts aimed at settling the issue of displaced people and provide the necessary financial resources, in order to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi displaced persons. We are undertaking ongoing efforts to strengthen our relations with Arab States and other States in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran. Once again, we reaffirm that an equitable, sustainable peace is the best strategic choice and that the peace process must be comprehensive. Peace in our region is impossible without the complete withdrawal of Israel from occupied Palestinian Arab lands and the full establishment of a Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital and within the pre-June 1967 borders. The Palestinian question is a priority for Iraq. We will therefore spare no effort in supporting the Palestinian people so that they can enjoy their legitimate right to establish a Palestinian State. We reject all international policies that run counter to the two-State solution or undermine initiatives that could resolve the question of Palestine. With respect to the situation in Syria, our position has been clear since the crisis there began in 2011. Our position is based on a call for a political solution rather than a military one. We have adopted a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. Iraq supports efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria in order to protect our Syrian brothers and sisters and preserve the unity of Syrian territory. We have opted for a political solution that would settle all of the issues in the Middle East, including the issues of Yemen and Libya. The genocide of the suffering Rohingya people in Rakhine state in Myanmar, which has been perpetrated by the armed forces of that country, calls for a firm international humanitarian effort to meet the challenge of the scope of the human rights violations and other crimes, which have been described in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. We would like to thank all countries participating in the Global Coalition, especially the United States, the European Union and other countries outside the Coalition, for their efforts against terrorism and for their logistics and military support to Iraqi forces in the framework of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. We need help from the international community to rebuild the liberated areas as quickly as possible. As a result of the war on terrorism, other Iraqi governorates have faced the suspension of reconstruction projects and development opportunities. That needs to be included in the reconstruction campaign. We see in the liberated cities many suffering women and children. We called on the international community to actively participate in the donor conference that will be organized in Kuwait early next year. We would like to thank Kuwait for all its efforts to support Iraq and to relieve the burden that the displaced have had to carry. Furthermore, we attach great importance to freeing our society from the culture of hatred, murder and isolation disseminated by Daâ??esh. We are working to counter the effects of these practices. We need the international community, through our foreign partners, to assist us in form of consultation and financial investment. Once again, we call for partnerships with companies in our friendly countries in investing in the areas of the economy, energy, housing, transportation, health, and the building of hospitals and schools. We are providing a legislative environment conducive to attracting companies and investors. I would like to express Iraqâ??s thanks to its armed forces for the sacrifices they have made. These armed forces have fought and continue to fight against Daâ??esh, whether they be forces of the Peshmerga, the army, the police or anti-terrorist forces. Indeed, Daâ??esh was unable to control the south of the country â?? it controlled only Mosul and Salah al-Din. However, the people of the south also participated in the struggle against Daâ??esh in Salah al-Din, Mosul, Anbar, Najaf and all other provinces, including Kirkuk and Diwaniyah. The people of the south of Iraq participated in that historic battle against terrorism, sacrificing their own lives. I would like to express our thanks to the Iraqi people for that sacrifice. I am very grateful to all parties, including the Peshmerga, the popular mobilization forces and anti-terrorist forces. We hope that we will be able to achieve peace, security and prosperity, both economically and socially, for all States and peoples. We hope to obtain cooperation at all levels and in all sectors to achieve a world that is free of terrorism and corruption.",1,196
7783,Session 72 - 2017,ISL_72_2017.txt,ISL_72_2017,72,2017,ISL,"We live in a world of opportunity. Never have we had such potential to end poverty, hunger and violations of human rights, and focus on people striving for a decent life. We can either succeed or we can fail. It is a choice; it is a decision. It is our responsibility and it is our task. This task is not just about numbers or statistics, but real-life people. There is purpose and worth to each and every life. Let us not forget. Our task is not easy. But the most important things in life are never easy. The right path is always difficult, and we definitely face difficulties. The consequences of climate change, bad governance, terrorism and conflict have made our world seem more dangerous, less predictable and more chaotic, as our Secretary-General has put it. It is our common responsibility to safeguard the progress we have made since the establishment of this institution and to make good on our promises of prosperity for all. The worldâ??s economic and social progress has, in large part, been driven by science and rational action, based on evidence. We must hold firm to that approach. Only policy, grounded in facts and evidence, can help us deal with such common threats as climate change and create a world that truly reflects our values. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide the blueprints for our success. Now we must deliver. Droughts, sea-level rise, ocean acidification and other consequences of climate change have wide-ranging implications for all our communities. Climate change is nowhere as visible as in the Arctic, with far-reaching consequences in the other parts of the world. The melting of the polar ice in the North causes higher sea levels in the South. What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. In fulfilling our Paris Agreement obligations, we aim to reduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 collectively with our European countries. Iceland remains committed to that goal. Since the establishment of this institution, a rule-based international order has been the foundation for peace and prosperity. The assault on the rule of law by certain Governments undermines the stability of the international system. We condemn in the strongest terms the illegal actions of North Korean leaders and call on them to accept generous offers to return to the negotiating table. During the past weeks, we have at last seen a united Security Council act firmly but constructively to push for dialogue and confidence-building measures, while staying firm on strengthening sanctions in the face of continued provocation. The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Government against its own people was a blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws and demanded a firm response by the international community. Complex internal conflicts have led to displacement and suffering on a massive scale, with famine looming in many areas, including Yemen. The issue of Western Sahara remains unresolved with tensions rising. The disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is another serious assault on the international rule-based order. The Security Council bears primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Along with several other countries, Iceland has encouraged the Security Council to include long-term perspectives in its mission mandates to lay the foundations for lasting peace. The modern era has also seen the rise of non-State actors â?? something our system did not plan for. Terrorists have sought to undermine trust and tolerance within and among our communities. Alongside improvements of the United Nations anti-terrorism mechanism, we must identify the drivers of violent extremism and terrorism. At the heart of conflict and violent extremism lies a failure of development. That is where the 2030 Agenda must play a vital role. The 2030 Agenda is indeed a remarkable achievement. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as human rights, peace and development are inseparable and essential to the successful implementation of the Agenda. I take very seriously the Secretary-Generalâ??s warning that disregard for human rights is a disease, and it is a disease that is spreading â?? north, south, east and west. The violation of freedom of expression, of rights to free assembly, of the fundamental rights of women â?? all undermine the 2030 Agenda. Extrajudicial killings, repression of minorities and the denial of the right to legitimate opposition set back sustainable development, sometimes by generations. Here I would like to express deep concern at the completely unacceptable situation of the Rohingya population in Myanmar. Iceland knows first-hand the massive potential that lies in gender equality. With UN-Women as a key partner, Iceland is a dedicated proponent of womenâ??s human rights. We actively work to engage men in the fight for gender equality and, indeed, our Prime Minister is a HeForShe IMPACT Champion. We support the United Nations Population Fund and the SheDecides initiative for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and continue to promote womenâ??s participation in the peace and security agenda. I commend the Secretary-General for his commitment to gender equality within the United Nations and his determination in addressing the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers and United Nations staff â?? a betrayal of the civilians under their care and of the values of the United Nations. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Iceland was one the poorest countries in western Europe. Now, we are one of the richest. Why? The answer to that question is the key to our approach to the task at hand of delivering for the people of this world who are striving for a decent life, and making sure that everyone can benefit from this world of ours â?? the world of opportunities. Icelandâ??s path from rags to riches is a textbook example of the power of free trade. We gained access to large foreign markets where we could sell our products, and by doing so we changed our fortunes. Every year, we gather here in the capital of free trade and talk about the importance of ending poverty in the world. We can talk the talk, but can we really walk the walk? We can really do something about this. We can open our markets. We can let the poorer countries trade freely with our consumers. Let us trade, and let us keep in mind that free trade is not only the exchange of goods or services for money. Free trade is forming relationships. Free trade is people interacting, travelling and understanding each other, regardless of colour or religion. Free trade is the most powerful tool to establish and maintain peace. While the markets of the richest countries in the world remain closed to the poorest countries, it is truly our obligation to provide development assistance. A large share of Icelandâ??s bilateral assistance goes to the least developed countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. We focus on our areas of expertise, such as energy and fisheries, while at the same time ensuring a horizontal emphasis on human rights and gender equality. To share our knowledge and experience, Iceland hosts United Nations University (UNU) programmes on fisheries management, geothermal energy and land restoration, in addition to its UNU gender programme. Through projects and partnerships with the International Renewable Energy Agency, Sustainable Energy for All and the World Bank, Iceland works actively to increase the utilization of sustainable geothermal energy. We also support the work of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to increase food security and mitigate climate change through land restoration. Continuing a tradition of leadership in oceans affairs, Iceland actively contributed to the United Nations Ocean Conference earlier this year. Our many commitments include reducing marine litter and plastics in the ocean, an issue on which Governments, businesses and individuals must cooperate. Allow me to welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s appointment of Mr. Peter Thomson as his Special Envoy for the Ocean. We look forward to working with Mr. Thomson. Unlocking the transformative potential of people and the private sector is key to success. In financing for development, we must be clear that development cooperation, while vital, is only a small part of what is needed. Good governance, strong institutions, human rights and equal opportunities are essential to inclusive economic progress, which eventually depends on the political will of leaders. Creating an environment in which doing business is easy and investment makes sense is key to growth. Iceland strongly believes in the potential of globalization and international trade as an engine for economic growth and poverty reduction. We must continue to promote a universal, rules-based, fair, multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization. At the same time, we must be aware of the measures necessary to enable the least developed countries to participate on fair terms. If we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, this is not the time to erect trade barriers. The dire situation of the 65 million people driven from their homes by conflict, economic hardship and climate change urgently requires a solution. How we, as an international community, address migration will define us for future generations. The forthcoming process towards global compacts for refugees and for safe, orderly and regular migration will give us the opportunity to establish new and comprehensive approaches to that current challenge. Those approaches must be grounded in humanitarian law and respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially children. As host communities, we should not forget the positive contribution that migrants can make to growth and sustainable development. Iceland has received an ever-increasing number of refugees, in addition to providing generous assistance to United Nations agencies working in the countries that neighbour Syria. We will continue to do our part. Our forefathers, scarred by the Second World War and economic depression, had the foresight to set up the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions. Just as this great building was renovated so successfully a few years ago, so too must the United Nations to be made fit for purpose in the modern era. We strongly support the work of the Secretary-General in management reform, development reform and his sustaining peace agenda.",1,196
7784,Session 72 - 2017,ISR_72_2017.txt,ISR_72_2017,72,2017,ISR,"We are in the midst of a great revolution â?? a revolution in Israelâ??s standing among the nations. It is happening because so many countries around the world have finally woken up to what Israel can do for them. Those countries now recognize what brilliant investors like Warren Buffett and great companies like Google and Intel have recognized and known for years, that is, that Israel is the innovation nation, the place for cutting-edge technology in agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, in medicine, in autonomous vehicles. You name it, we have got it. Those countries now also recognize Israelâ??s exceptional capabilities in fighting terrorism. In recent years, Israel has provided intelligence that has prevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around the world. We have saved countless lives. Members may not know it, but their Governments do. And they are working closely together with Israel to keep their countries and its citizens safe. I stood here last year, at this rostrum, and I spoke about that profound change in Israelâ??s standing around the world (see A/71/PV.14). Just look at what has happened since. In one year, hundreds of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and other leaders have visited Israel â?? many for the first time. Of those many visits, two were truly historic. In May, President Trump became the first American President to include Israel in his first visit abroad. President Trump stood at the Western Wall, at the foot of the Temple Mount, where the Jewish peopleâ??s temples stood for nearly 1,000 years. When the President touched those ancient stones, he touched our hearts forever. In July, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. Some here may have seen the pictures. We were on a beach in Hadera. We rode together in a Jeep outfitted with a portable desalination device that some thriving Israeli entrepreneur invented. We took off our shoes, waded into the Mediterranean and drank seawater that had been purified only a few minutes earlier. We imagined the endless possibilities for Israel, for India and for all of humankind. In the past year, Israel has hosted many world leaders. I had the honour of representing my country on six different continents in one year. I went to Africa, where I saw Israeli innovators increasing crop yields, turning air into water, fighting AIDS. I went to Asia, where we deepened our relations with China and Singapore, and expanded our cooperation with our Muslim friends in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. I went to Europe, where, in London and Paris, Thessaloniki and Budapest we enhanced our security and economic ties. I went to Australia, becoming the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit our great allies down under. And just last week, I went to South America, visiting Argentina and Colombia, and then I went on to Mexico â?? becoming, if members can believe it, the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Latin America. After 70 years, the world is embracing Israel, and Israel is embracing the world. In one year, I visited six continents. It is true that I have not yet visited Antarctica, but I want to go there too, because I have heard that penguins are also enthusiastic supporters of Israel. Members laugh. But penguins have no difficulty recognizing that some things are black or white, are right or wrong. Unfortunately, when it comes to United Nations decisions about Israel, that simple recognition is too often absent. It was absent last December, when the Security Council adopted anti-Israel resolution 2334 (2016), which set back the cause of peace. It was absent last May, when the World Health Organization â?? one has to listen to this â?? adopted a Syrian-sponsored draft resolution that criticized Israel for health conditions on the Golan Heights. As the great John McEnroe would say, â??You cannot be serious!â?? That is preposterous. Syria has barrel-bombed, starved, gassed and murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens, and wounded millions more, while Israel has provided life-saving medical care to thousands of Syrian victims of that very same carnage. Yet who does the World Health Organization criticize? Israel. Is there no limit to United Nations absurdities when it comes to Israel? Apparently not, because in July, UNESCO declared the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site. That is worse than fake news; that is fake history. While it is true that Abraham, the father of both Ishmael and Isaac, is buried there, so are Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca and Leah â?? who just happen to be patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people. Members will not read about that in the latest UNESCO report. But if members want to read about it, they can in a somewhat weightier publication. It is called the Bible. I highly recommend it. I hear it got four and a half out of five stars on Amazon, and it is a great read. I read it every week. Let me now be serious. Despite the absurdities, despite the repetition of those farcical events, there is change. Slowly, but surely, there are signs of positive change â?? even at the United Nations. I very much appreciate the statement of the Secretary-General, indicating that denying Israelâ??s right to exist is anti-Semitism â?? pure and simple. That is important, because for too long the epicentre of global anti-semitism has been right here at the United Nations. And while it may take many years, I am absolutely confident that the revolution of Israelâ??s ties with individual nations will ultimately be reflected here in this Hall of nations. I say that because there is also a marked change in the position of some of our key friends. Thanks to President Trumpâ??s unequivocal support for Israel in this organ, that positive change is gathering force. I thank President Trump for supporting Israel at the United Nations, and I thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her support. I thank them for speaking the truth about Israel. Here at the United Nations we must also speak the truth about Iran, as President Trump did so powerfully this morning. I served as Ambassador to the United Nations and I am a long-serving Israeli Prime Minister, so I have listened to countless speeches in this Hall. But I can say this â?? none were bolder, none were more courageous and forthright, than the one delivered by President Trump today. President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran â??an embarrassmentâ??. I could not agree with that more. Here is why â?? Iran vows to destroy my country every day. That vow was repeated by its Chief of Staff the other day. Iran is conducting a campaign of conquest across the Middle East. And Iran is developing ballistic missiles to threaten the entire world. Two years ago, I stood here and explained why the Iranian nuclear deal not only did not block Iranâ??s path to the bomb, but actually paved it. That is because the restrictions placed on Iranâ??s nuclear programme have what is called a â??sunset clauseâ??. Let me explain what that term means. It means that in a few years those restrictions will be automatically removed, not by a change in Iranâ??s behaviour, not by a lessening of its terror or its aggression, but merely by a change in the calendar. I warned that when that sunset came, a dark shadow would be cast over the entire Middle East and the world â?? because Iran would then be free to enrich uranium on an industrial scale, placing it on the threshold of a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons. That is why I said two years ago that the greater danger was not that Iran would rush to a single bomb by breaking the deal, but that Iran would be able to build many bombs by keeping the deal. In the past few months we have all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear weapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime. Imagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in the hands of a vast Iranian Islamist empire, with the missiles to deliver them anywhere on Earth. I know that there are those who still defend the dangerous deal with Iran, arguing that it will block Iranâ??s path to the bomb. That is exactly what they said about the nuclear deal with North Korea, and we all know how that turned out. Unfortunately, if nothing changes, this deal will turn out exactly the same way. That is why Israelâ??s policy regarding the nuclear deal with Iran is very simple â?? change it or cancel it, fix it or nix it. Nixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions, until Iran fully dismantles its nuclear-weapon capabilities. Fixing the deal requires many things, among them inspecting military sites and any other site that is suspect, and penalizing Iran for every violation. Above all, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset clause. Beyond fixing this bad deal, we must also stop Iranâ??s development of ballistic missiles and roll back its growing aggression in the region. I remember we have had these debates. As members know, I took a fairly active role in them. Many supporters of the deal naively believed that it would somehow moderate Iran and make it a â??responsibleâ?? member of the international community. I strongly disagreed. I warned that, when the sanctions on Iran would be removed, Iran would behave like a hungry tiger unleashed â?? not joining the community of nations, but devouring nations one after the other. That is precisely what Iran is doing today. From the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, from Tehran to Tartus, an Iranian curtain is descending across the Middle East. Iran spreads that curtain of tyranny and terror over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. And it pledges to extinguish the light of Israel. Today I have a simple message for Ayatollah Khamenei, the dictator of Iran: the light of Israel will never be extinguished. Those who threaten us with annihilation put themselves in mortal peril. Israel will defend itself with the full force of our arms and the full power of our convictions. We will act to prevent Iran from establishing permanent military bases in Syria for its air, sea and ground forces. We will act to prevent Iran from producing deadly weapons, in Syria or in Lebanon, for use against us. And we will act to prevent Iran from opening new terror fronts against Israel along our northern border. As long as Iranâ??s regime seeks the destruction of Israel, Iran will face no fiercer enemy than Israel. But I also have a message today for the people of Iran, who are not our enemy. They are our friends. One day my Iranian friends will be free from the evil regime that terrorizes them, hangs gays, jails journalists, tortures political prisoners and shoots innocent women like Neda Soltani, leaving her choking on her own blood on the streets of Tehran. I have not forgotten Neda, and I am sure that neither have members. When the day of liberation for the people of Iran finally comes, the friendship between our two ancient peoples will surely flourish once again. Israel knows that we are not alone in confronting the Iranian regime. We stand shoulder to shoulder with those in the Arab world who share our hopes for a brighter future. We have made peace with Jordan and Egypt, whose courageous President, Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, I met here last night. I appreciate President Al Sisiâ??s support for peace, and I hope to work closely with him and other leaders in the region to advance peace. Israel is committed to achieving peace with all of our Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians. Yesterday President Trump and I discussed all of this at great length. I appreciate President Trumpâ??s leadership, his commitment to stand by Israelâ??s side, his commitment to advance a peaceful future for all. Together, we can seize the opportunities for peace and together we can confront the great dangers of Iran. The remarkable alliance between the United States and Israel has never been stronger and never been deeper. Israel is deeply grateful for the support of the Trump Administration, the American Congress and the American people. In this year of historic visits and historic anniversaries, Israel has much to be grateful for. A hundred and twenty years ago, Theodor Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress to transform our tragic past into a brilliant future by establishing the Jewish State. One hundred years ago, the Balfour Declaration advanced Herzlâ??s vision by recognizing the right of the Jewish people to a national home in our ancestral homeland. Seventy years ago, the United Nations further advanced that vision by adopting resolution 181 (II), supporting the establishment of a Jewish State. Fifty years ago, we reunited our eternal capital â?? Jerusalem â?? achieving a miraculous victory against those who sought to destroy our State. Theodor Herzl was our modern Moses, and his dream has come true. We have returned to the promised land, revived our language, ingathered our exiles and built a modern, thriving democracy. Tomorrow evening Jews around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the beginning of our new year. It is a time of reflection, and we look back with wonder at the remarkable and miraculous rebirth of our nation. We look ahead with pride to the remarkable contributions Israel will continue to make to all nations. A simple look around will reveal those contributions every day â?? in the food people eat, the water they drink, the medicines they take, the cars they drive, the cell phones they use and in so many other ways that are transforming our world. It can be seen in the smile of an African mother in a remote village who, thanks to an Israeli innovation, no longer must walk eight hours a day to bring water to her children. It can be seen in the eyes of an Arab child who has flown to Israel to undergo a lifesaving heart operation. And it can be seen in the faces of the people in earthquake-stricken Haiti and Nepal, who are rescued from the rubble and given new life by Israeli doctors. As the prophet Isaiah said: â??I have made you a light unto the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the Earth.â?? Today, 2,700 years after Isaiah spoke those prophetic words, Israel is becoming a rising power among the nations. And, at long last, its light is shining across the continents, bringing hope and salvation to the ends of the Earth. Happy new year from Israel.",1,196
7785,Session 72 - 2017,ITA_72_2017.txt,ITA_72_2017,72,2017,ITA,"I cannot begin my statement without sparing a thought for a friendly country, Mexico, struck by a grave natural disaster. We express our solidarity with the families of the victims and our encouragement to the relief workers. The seventy-second session of the General Assembly is taking place in a complex and constantly moving global context. The socioeconomic effects of globalization, which can create hardship and inequalities, also compound the persistence of major instability in the international geopolitical framework. The world seems more and more unpredictable, especially when it must address extraordinary challenges. The international community must find a way to overcome those obstacles and look to the future with confidence. There is hope to be found in the signs of optimism that accompany the recovery of our economies. It is up to us to navigate this road to development with responsibility and courage. We must do so first through better governance of global processes to assure robust and inclusive economic growth aimed primarily at reducing inequalities. Italy is convinced that building democratic, pluralistic and inclusive societies that are open to diversity represents not only an ethical imperative but also the best guarantee of peace and stability. This is a fundamental part of a broader commitment to promoting and guaranteeing effective protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of each individual. The shared journey of hopes and gains undertaken by the European Union â?? which for Italy represents the first natural dimension of multilateralism â?? teaches us that we must have the courage to react to the challenges we face daily. In the past two years the European Union has been forced, perhaps for the first time, to abandon its â??climate-controlledâ?? environment â?? perhaps with difficulty â?? in order to tackle some of the greatest challenges to have emerged since the post-war period. It has not been easy, nor has it been the beginning of the end, which many had feared, but rather an opportunity for a powerful collective reminder of the need to remain united within the European project. Today I affirm with profound conviction that a new European impetus exists, which Italy not only shares but actively promotes. There is a will to proceed as one to bring the European project closer to the needs of citizens, the challenges of economic growth, security, and migration. It is a project that strengthens the greatly needed global role of the Union in the world, inspired by multilateralism, free exchange and respect for rule of law. In short, this story concerns us all, because a European Union that can once again give the whole world an example of solidarity, progress, prosperity and effectiveness is a contribution to the progress and development of the whole world. For Italy, the development of social, economic and political inclusiveness, extended also to the labour market, as well as fighting poverty and marginalization, means contributing to a more effective management of the challenge of migration. We must respond with compassion, intelligence and vision to the permanent reality of the vast human movements of our time. For years, Italy has been engaged in operations to rescue and receive migrants. We have saved and continue to save hundreds of thousands of persons who risked drowning in the Mediterranean, true to our ethical and moral imperatives and to the international obligations we have freely undersigned. We are proud of this, but to consolidate our action we need a general, global response to the migration phenomenon. It cannot rely solely upon the generosity of some territories, in the knowledge that there are nations in the world that are struck by migratory flows on an even larger and more serious scale than Italy. To continue to affirm and embody the principle of shared and proportionate responsibility, Italy is participating actively in the negotiations that will lead to the adoption of global compacts in the United Nations framework. Our proposal to jointly address the migration phenomenon on a global level is based on three main pillars: investing in support of the countries of origin and transit, protecting the most vulnerable refugees and migrants, and valuing the many positive aspects and opportunities created by migration. Italy is already the promoter of a true partnership with the African countries. As I have already had occasion to express and repeat today with conviction, the future of Europe is in Africa. It is by investing in Africa that we can address the deep causes of migration, first and foremost economic and demographic inequalities. We are working with the International Organization for Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide assistance to migrants with respect for their human rights, assure the protection of refugees fleeing from wars and persecution and offer favourable conditions and incentives for their voluntary repatriation. Reducing the power of human traffickers is the only way to create progress for legal migration, which is also to the benefit of our countries and does not jeopardize the lives of migrants. To protect those who are weakest is to protect our values. Saving the lives of children allows us to save our societies, our honour and our future. For Italy, by virtue of our geography and history, our emphasis on responsible and solidary management of the movement of persons is coupled with an emphasis on the security, stability, sustainable development and growth of the Mediterranean and of the African continent as a whole. It is all included in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. We know that the ever-increasing apparent loss of territory for Daâ??esh in Iraq and Syria has demonstrated the effectiveness of our work but we also know that victory on the ground is not enough. The fanaticism and ideology of Daâ??esh and of Jihad continue to claim victims and sow terror in our cities and in half of the cities around the world. Italy is an active partner in the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh and is engaged in various activities, starting with the presence of its soldiers in Iraq and the second-largest contingent of the Coalition, after the American contingent. Nonetheless, it is because we are engaged with our military forces that we recall that the fight against terrorism requires a multidimensional force. I would mention initiatives such as countering the use of the Internet and social media by terrorists â?? which we will address here at the United Nations â?? and the financing of terrorist groups. I would also point to the investments that we must make to promote culture and inclusiveness in our regions and in the neighbourhoods of our cities. We have devoted great energy in the Security Council, the General Assembly and as the Chair of the Group of Seven (G-7) to upgrade our capacity to respond to the new threats posed by terrorist groups, which are ever-evolving. Libya is the key to restoring to the central Mediterranean its historic role as a driver of civilization, and to countering the risks and threats. As we stated earlier today, its stabilization is a priority objective that must reject every unrealistic hypothesis of a military solution or division of the country. Italy is a leader in that commitment, and we welcome the fact that the United Nations has returned to action as a leader in Libya at the political level and at the level of providing assistance to refugees and migrants. We have an opportunity to restart the political process and prepare for upcoming elections. We have that opportunity today. It is in our hands and in the hands of the United Nations. Syria continues to be a source of concern and suffering. Let us not forget that. After six years of unspeakable violence, millions of refugees and hundreds of thousands of deaths, we welcome the recent efforts to promote local truces in the de-escalation zones. Let us also remember that the only road to a lasting solution to the Syrian conflict is a realistic and credible political process. There can be no stability, peace or reconstruction, or lasting victory over terrorism, or conditions for the voluntary return of refugees in complete security without an inclusive political transition that brings together the various components of Syrian society. That is why I would like to reaffirm today at the General Assembly our full support for the role of the United Nations and of Special Envoy De Mistura, and, at the same time, urge the main regional and international stakeholders to support the road map outlined in Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). Finally, ultimately, there could be no true peace without justice. That means ascertaining who was responsible for committing atrocity crimes over the years, which began with the use of chemical weapons. Dialogue and reconciliation are also indispensable instruments for lasting peace on the African continent. Italy has intensified and systematized just actions for the Sahel region, in particular for the Niger, Chad and Mali, which are working with immense difficulty to fight terrorist and criminal organizations and the illegal trafficking activities linked to them, starting with the heinous trafficking in persons. In that context, we are convinced that the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5) initiative is essential and we welcomed the decision of the G-5 Sahel countries to launch, with the support of the African Union, a joint force. Italy continues to assure maximum support for the Horn of Africa â?? the key to stability for the entire region and to resolving a complex crisis aggravated by climate change, which has led to a devastating drought. Initiatives in Somalia are moving in the right direction. Italy will continue to support them, given our ancient links to that country. I would be remiss if I did not mention our deep concern about the very serious situation in Venezuela. It is a situation that has turned a rich and prosperous country into a land of crises and suffering. Italy reiterates its call for an immediate and good-faith dialogue, which cannot disregard the four conditions on the table, namely, authorization to send international assistance, a clearly established electoral calendar, the restoration of the Parliamentâ??s powers and the release of all political prisoners. Finally, we look upon the situation on the Korean peninsula with great anguish and distress, in the face of repeated violations of pertinent Security Council resolutions. It is fundamental for the international community to remain unified and determined in its response and it is in that spirit that, as president of the G-7, Italy promoted a firm group declaration. It is crucial to ensure the full implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions. Every now and then, someone wonders about the usefulness of the United Nations and about the many things happening in the world, but the resolutions that we have unanimously adopted in recent weeks as instruments to exert pressure on the dictator of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea are a positive result for the United Nations. They demonstrate that we are ready to cooperate with our partners to continue to put the much needed diplomatic and economic pressure on the regime. With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, we believe that the international community should ensure that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action remains a positive factor in the global efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, we are convinced of the importance of the full and comprehensive implementation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). Autocratic regimes, terrorism and international environmental crises pose a grave threat to the planet. But we, the United Nations, cannot and will not give up this fight. The Secretary-General has made prevention one of his highest priorities, and Italy supports him in that commitment. We need to prevent conflict and natural disasters and the humanitarian and migration crises that follow, which, in turn, cause further instability. Prevention means everything except building barriers. It means instead achieving inclusive and sustainable development and addressing crises with multilateral efforts. We cannot face those threats alone. The response must be a joint response. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development outlines with clear-sighted ambition a shared path forward. Together, we have written the prescription â?? now we must follow through. Climate change calls for the same dedicated effort. Secretary-General Guterres pointed that out a few days ago when he said that, if we do not address climate change now, we will ruin many of our grandchildrenâ??s opportunities for a positive and dignified life. We are facing an emergency, the social consequences of which do not need to projected onto the future. They are already tragically apparent. We need only think of the more than 200 million displaced persons who, from 2008 to 2015, were forced to leave their homes due to the devastating effects of climate phenomena. The crises and the challenges of our time can be overcome, and those of the future can be prevented. It depends on us, the United Nations. We need a United Nations that is more effective in enacting the inspirational principles that continue to be valid after so many years. We count, too, on the leadership of the Secretary-General. We fully support his reform plans, including his commitment to empowering women and girls and the achievement of gender equality as a tool for bolstering the efficiency of the Organization. That revitalization also obviously includes the reform of the Security Council to render it more democratic, effective and representative of the entire membership of the United Nations â?? because, just as the membership has evolved and expanded since its establishment, the same must occur in the primary organ that is its centre of responsibility. The current global scenario calls upon us to respond to many challenges that demonstrate that history did not end a quarter of a century ago, as some had believed. We are called upon to constantly renew our endorsement of the values of peace, human rights, democracy and freedom. In other more difficult times of our history, we have seen those values retreat, but we know that even in the most difficult times, democracy can renew itself and grow and, in the end, can prevail.",1,196
7786,Session 72 - 2017,JAM_72_2017.txt,JAM_72_2017,72,2017,JAM,"I am delighted to extend the warm congratulations of Jamaica to the President for assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at the seventy-second session and to assure him of our support. We are particularly pleased to note his selection of a theme that underscores the fundamental importance of the transformative 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development, which is a plan for people, planet and prosperity. I express, on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, our deepest sympathies and prayers for the families and loved ones of victims of the recent hurricanes, which directly impacted our Caribbean brothers and sisters and those in the United States, as well as the families and loved ones of victims of recent earthquakes in Mexico, our dear friend from the region. I am deeply moved by the fact that following the passage of two massive hurricanes, thousands of people across the Caribbean are now forced into a life that is dramatically different from what it was just a few days ago. On behalf of our Caribbean brothers and sisters directly impacted by the hurricanes, we wish to thank those countries and organizations that have given without being asked, and to urge those who have the means to support these countries and their peoples in this time of urgent need. For us in the Caribbean, climate change is not a philosophical concept or an academic debate. It is an existential issue. It is our reality, and it requires urgent and effective action. We are ever mindful of our responsibility to strengthen our resilience and expedite efforts towards adaptation and mitigation. Yet our ability to do so is greatly impacted by the new catastrophic events that cause social dislocation and severe misalignment of our economies. The limited resources that we have are dwarfed by the huge sums required to meet recovery and reconstruction costs. How do small States like ours, many already facing adverse debt dynamics, mobilize the financing required to build climate-resilient infrastructure? To do so, it is imperative that we identify both grant funds and concessionary financing that can support investment in resilient infrastructure over the long term. If not, we will continue to be caught in an inescapable cycle of devastation, recovery and reconstruction, until the next disaster strikes. While it is essential to attend to the immediate humanitarian needs and reconstruction efforts, we must also urgently address our long-term Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs). I urge that in our collective efforts to implement the SDGs, we take account of the tremendous challenges faced by vulnerable countries completely knocked off course by external shocks. In such circumstances, the review and follow-up mechanisms associated with the time-bound commitments of the Agenda are rendered meaningless. Therefore, we call on the United Nations system to establish a mechanism to provide the requisite support and compensation to vulnerable countries affected by natural disasters, where their implementation of the 2030 Agenda and progress towards achieving the SDGs have been derailed as a result of such external shocks. In recognition of our vulnerabilities as a small island developing State and the attendant complexities of our status as a middle-income country, Jamaica is collaborating with Chile on a new initiative called the Resilient 20. It seeks to create an alliance to promote resilience in countries prone to natural disasters, with a focus on middle-income countries. We also support calls for the development of a climate change vulnerability index to provide a standardized method for characterizing vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. That would enable international financial institutions and bilateral donors to better channel financial and technical resources towards countries most susceptible to loss and damage from climate change. Jamaica ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April, and regards that historic Agreement as critical to efforts to arrest the impact of climate change. Small island developing States were at the forefront of those negotiations and remain engaged in the Conference of the Parties process. It is an inescapable fact that we contribute the least to carbon emissions and yet we bear the brunt of the damage. In that context, we implore all Member States to abide by the commitments of the Agreement. Climate change also poses risks to tourism, which is an industry that owes its competitiveness to the pristine nature of our environment. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth and job creation are priorities for Jamaica, and tourism plays a critical role in ensuring that they are achieved. That industry relies heavily on the long-term sustainable investments made by the private sector, both national and international. For this International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, we have sought to increase such investments, create more jobs, promote culture and support community development, while safeguarding the natural environment. In November, in partnership with the World Tourism Organization (WTO) and the World Bank Group, Jamaica looks forward to hosting the United Nations-WTO International Conference on Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism, which will be the first time such a conference is being held in the Caribbean. Jamaica is deeply concerned about the heightened menace to international peace and security, arising particularly from the threat of nuclear weapons. We have a long-standing commitment to the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world and are a State party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which declared the Caribbean and Latin America as the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area. At the universal level, therefore, we welcome the fact that we now have the first global Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a critical step towards addressing some of those concerns. It is our hope that it will enter into force in short order and be duly observed universally. As global citizens starkly aware of how closely our futures are intertwined, we condemn the recent nuclear and ballistic-missile tests carried out by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which pose a grave threat to international peace and security. We urge North Korea to immediately and fully comply with its international obligations under all relevant Security Council resolutions and to resume dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The challenges that currently impede global peace and security require that we identify and address the root causes of conflict. We therefore fully support the focus placed by the Secretary-General on sustaining peace across the continuum from prevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping to peacebuilding and long- term development. We in Jamaica are working to provide our citizens with a safe and secure environment in which to live full and productive lives. Our strategy includes placing greater emphasis on safeguarding our porous borders, through which illicit firearms enter. Jamaica has benefited from the support of our international partners, and we invite continued collaboration in curbing this illicit trade. We therefore look forward to the third Review Conference of the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, to be convened in 2018. Furthermore, Jamaica will continue to play its part in supporting the universalization and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty. People and their well-being are at the heart of our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We remain focused on the most vulnerable of our citizens to ensure that those furthest behind will benefit first from the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The alignment between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and our national development plan, Vision 2030, creates a framework within which we can identify and achieve our priorities, not least of which is to ensure the dignity of the individual. What has become increasingly evident, however, is that securing the resources for the implementation of those development objectives remains critical at both the national and the international levels. In recognition of that fact, Jamaica has partnered with Canada to identify new and innovative means of financing development. Through the Group of Friends of SDG Financing, which our countries co-chair, we have been promoting the establishment of partnerships with the private sector, philanthropic organizations and academic institutions. We are exploring innovative financial mechanisms that can spur the investments needed to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs. Issues related to global economic governance, debt sustainability and SDG financing take on even more significance for highly indebted middle-income countries like Jamaica, which have large public investment needs but limited fiscal space. Our reduced access to concessionary finance and official development assistance is a direct consequence of our middle-income designation. We contend that the use of gross domestic product per capita as the sole criterion to graduate countries such as ours from concessionary financing represents an inadequate and inaccurate measure of a countryâ??s true development status. Accordingly, middle-income countries face the risk of having their hard-won socioeconomic gains reversed as a result of losing well-needed financial support, precisely at the time they need to consolidate and build on the gains they have made. We therefore commend and thank those, including the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Commonwealth Secretariat, that advocate for the application of a broader set of indicators that take account of the structural gaps in our countries. From a global perspective, it is important that the international economic and financial architecture be aligned with Agenda 2030 and take account of that very important distinction. Jamaica therefore urges that policymakers embed the SDGs into their design of international regulatory frameworks. Jamaica looks forward to the convening later this year of the eleventh World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, which brings with it the potential for advancing the Doha Development Agenda. As a small island developing State with an open economy that is highly reliant on foreign trade, we are dependent on a vibrant and dynamic global trading environment. We must secure improved market opportunities beyond our shores. We cannot, however, participate in the international economic and trading system without correspondent banking relations. Several international banks have withdrawn correspondent banking services from many small countries, including in the Caribbean, in an effort to de-risk their client portfolios in response to stringent regulatory penalties for compliance breaches. However, what is viewed by international banks as a simple balance-sheet issue has had unintended negative spill-over effects for countries in the Caribbean, with serious political and economic consequences. We call for urgent international attention to be given to that deepening crisis. I now turn to the issue of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which exact a high socioeconomic and development cost on all countries, but disproportionately so in small island developing States. Jamaica agrees that an effective response to that global pandemic is best addressed through multi-stakeholder partnerships in a comprehensive whole-of-Government response. We are firmly on that path. Jamaica is addressing NCDs by promoting healthy lifestyles from birth, increasing awareness of NCDs and encouraging physical activity across the country. We are also strengthening our policy and regulatory frameworks to address obesity in childhood and adulthood and other risk factors. Such efforts should be complemented by action taken at the global level. We therefore look forward to the 2018 high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases and reiterate the call for greater access by developing countries to the findings of modern research and technology. Jamaica is committed to the empowerment of women and girls, and our young people. We have revitalized our national youth parliament and created a national youth advisory council to ensure that young people have a voice at policymaking levels in our country. We are strengthening our legislative and policy frameworks to address violence against women and girls and to foster economic opportunities. We will also protect our children from abuse by maintaining vigilance with respect to new and emerging threats, such as cyberbullying and sexual exploitation online. Earlier this year, Jamaica became a party to The Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, and enacted legislation for its implementation. As we strengthen our national institutional framework to address trafficking in children, we also look forward to participating in next weekâ??s High-level Meeting on the Appraisal of the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. The movement of persons across borders is a natural phenomenon. Migrants are an asset both to their countries of destination and their countries of origin. Jamaica highly values the contribution that our diaspora makes to national development and to the development of their host countries. We are actively working on strategies to deepen our engagement. Consistent with a renewed focus on placing people at the centre of sustainable development, we must not forget the plight of the refugees and persons displaced by conflict and natural disasters â?? occurrences not of their own making. Against this background, the ongoing deliberations on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration take on even more significance as we move to the intergovernmental negotiations phase during this session of the General Assembly. Jamaicaâ??s adherence to the principles of the United Nations is rooted in a belief in multilateralism and the benefits we derive from collaboration and cooperation. The most intractable disputes require us to engage collectively in the quest for lasting and meaningful solutions. In this regard, we reiterate our call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. This unjust embargo has restricted the ability of a hard-working and self-reliant people to engage in legitimate trade, to travel and to undertake international financial transactions. Turning to the Middle East, we continue to believe that the best solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis rests in a negotiated political settlement based on a just, lasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees the security of Israel and provides for a Palestinian State within internationally recognized borders. With respect to the situation concerning Western Sahara, we recall the appeal of the Security Council to all parties to show realism and a spirit of compromise to move the negotiations forward. Jamaica therefore supports the relaunch of negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations, leading to the resumption of a process with the aim of reaching a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution. Our collective efforts in all these political, economic and social areas require an effective and dynamic United Nations. Jamaica therefore supports reforms that improve coordination, enhance coherence and strengthen the effectiveness of the Organization. Reform measures must ensure that the United Nations remains connected to the people it seeks to serve and must be informed by the realities on the ground in programme countries. They should advance all three key pillars of the work of the United Nations: peace and security, development and the promotion of human rights. A renewed and revitalized United Nations reform effort will allow us to reap the full benefits of multilateralism. I conclude by reaffirming Jamaicaâ??s unfailing belief in our ability as a community of nations, whose destiny and prosperity are intertwined, to make a difference in the life of every human being. I therefore encourage all of us to be bold and unrelenting in our quest to make this world a better place, leaving no one behind. Let us go forward in the conviction that we can achieve peace and prosperity for our peoples and protect our planet for the benefit of future generations.",1,196
7787,Session 72 - 2017,JOR_72_2017.txt,JOR_72_2017,72,2017,JOR,"I am honoured today to speak on behalf of His Majesty King Abdullah II and the people of Jordan. I bring Jordanâ??s sincere congratulations on the election of President LajcÃ¡k and our commitment to the work of the General Assembly. To Secretary-General Guterres, I extend my countryâ??s great appreciation for his partnership with our people. Two years ago, I had the chance to advocate on behalf of my generation and to chair a delegation that participated in the work leading to the adoption of the first Security Council resolution on youth. Our joint efforts resulted in the historic, unanimous adoption of resolution 2250 (2015), on youth, peace and security, aimed at empowering young people to participate in peace processes and dispute resolution. Today, I stand before the Assembly not only as a representative of my beloved Jordan, but also as a member of the largest generation of young people in history. Like every other generation, we have inherited the collective wisdom and values of our elders. And like others before us, we must often struggle to reconcile them with our reality today. What that reality is is unprecedented. Ours is a world at an epic intersection, driven by the confluence of deepened globalization and disruptive technologies. We are at the brink of a fourth industrial revolution that is redefining how we function as societies and how we relate to one another as human beings. Our hyperconnected world is at once bringing people closer together and widening the divisions among them. Amid all that, the young people of my generation are asking: what are the values that anchor global citizenship today? In which direction does our collective moral compass point, and can it guide us safely to justice, prosperity and peace for all? Too often, people of my generation are labelled dreamers, yet we all know that every great deed was born a dream. We are often dismissed as idealists, but idealism is not foolish; it is fearless. It invigorates us to lift our reality to the level of our higher ideals, and not to compromise our ideals in the face of adversity. So I humbly ask those present to indulge me as I try, on behalf of my generation, to sharpen the contours of our foggy terrain and put forward some rudimentary questions that are unfettered by the political decorum that I know I will acquire with time. I will use my country, Jordan, as a launchpad for those thoughts and questions, as I believe they are a true embodiment of what is so right and yet so wrong with our world today. Throughout its history, Jordan has suffered external shock after external shock, but the past couple of decades have been relentless. We are currently bordered by a number of conflicts. Over the years, there have been wars in Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and there are worsening prospects for peace in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Jordan has also had to weather the global financial crisis and the energy crises. All that has affected us in very real and felt ways. Our largest export market, Iraq, was completely shut off. Trade with Syria came to a halt, and we lost critical trade routes from Europe and Turkey. Despite our best efforts, regional instability has undermined tourism and investment. I do not know of any other country in recent history that has gone through such an onslaught of crises and found itself surrounded by so many conflicts through no fault of its own. And it does not stop there. My country â?? a resource-poor nation in a conflict-rich region â?? is host to 1.3 million Syrian refugees, in addition to millions of Palestinian refugees and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, as well as others from Libya and Yemen. Jordan today is one of the largest hosts of refugees in the world. The direct cost of the Syria crisis now consumes more than a quarter of our budget. Its ripple effects are felt across local communities, where 90 per cent of Syrian refugees live. Housing, food, energy, health care, education and jobs are all under pressure. Yet in the face of those daunting challenges, we did not back down from our ideals or values. We did not turn our backs on people in need. We are weighed down by massive debt, yet we stand tall and proud. Our soldiers dodge bullets to let refugees into our country, not to keep them out. Nor did we falter in our reform efforts, difficult as some of them have been on our people. On the contrary, the heavier our burden became, the more forcefully we forged ahead. Please do not misunderstand me; we are not perfect. To bring down unemployment and create the jobs needed for youth and future generations, we need to drastically improve our investment climate; enhance integrity and accountability; advance our education system; and support young entrepreneurs. Ordinarily, assistance would be tied to our progress. But these are extraordinary times, and aid is a necessary runway if our political and economic reforms are to fully take off. Difficult circumstances did not stop Jordan from being a net contributor to global good. We have remained steadfast in our commitment to a just and peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two-State solution, despite prevailing scepticism. We have staunchly upheld our duty as Hashemite custodians of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Preserving the historical and legal status quo at Al-Aqsa Mosque/Haram al-Sharif is key to peace in our region and the world, as Jerusalem is the cradle of all three monotheistic religions. We have been unwavering in the international war against terrorism and our promotion of the true values of Islam. Our peacekeeping troops have protected innocent civilians from Haiti to Darfur to East Timor; and our calls for inclusiveness and moderation ring loud in a region too often deafened by division and extremism. We have done the right thing, over and over again, because that is what real integrity means. But how has the world reacted? No doubt, Jordan is regularly praised for its humanitarian and moral stance, and we are proud of our countryâ??s reputation. But kind words do not balance budgets, build schools or bolster employment. For the people and youth of Jordan, important questions linger. How can it be that a country as small as ours struggles in the face of such crushing adversity, only to be told that its friends are suffering from donor fatigue? Financial institutions often remind us that on a per capita basis, we are a top recipient of aid. Yet, on a per capita basis, few countries have endured as many external shocks or contributed to global peace and security as Jordan has. How can it be that a country like Jordan offers a humble home to millions of desperate people, while richer countries around the world quibble over accepting thousands? What does it say about our common humanity when last year alone the world spent close to $1.7 trillion on arms, but fell short by less than $1.7 billion in fulfilling the United Nations appeal to support Syrian refugees and host communities in countries like Jordan? What does it say when trillions are spent waging wars in our region, but little to take our region to safer shores? There are no good answers. The sad reality is that war economies are thriving to the benefit of a few, while real economies are suffering to the detriment of all. The message to the youth of Jordan and our region is loud and clear: there is no shortage of money for fighting evil, but the appetite for rewarding virtue is nearly non-existent; that the voice of those who defend and build is drowned out by those who attack and destroy. It just does not add up. So, what do we tell the people of Jordan? What does the international community tell our young majority? Do we tell them that the values we live by are of no value? That pragmatism beats principles? That complacency trumps compassion? Or that we should play it safe; turn our backs on people in need, because we cannot count on others to have our back? The United Nations is our global conscience, but for too many in my country, and others around the world trying to do good, it sometimes feels like the worldâ??s conscience is on silent mode. It is time to break the silence and start finding answers. In doing so, we can unleash a global current that carries our common humanity to safer shores. Our commitment to peace, moderation and international cooperation is uncompromising. Water a thirsty fruit-bearing tree or continue to add fuel to a raging fire? The world has a choice to make.",1,196
7788,Session 72 - 2017,JPN_72_2017.txt,JPN_72_2017,72,2017,JPN,"I had intended to begin today by speaking of the sincerity with which Japan is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, and I hoped to introduce the innovative ways by which we have been fostering public awareness of those Goals within Japan. I wanted to explain why the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative is important to me personally and to the Government of Japan. I have been saying we will make universal health coverage part of the Japan brand, and in December we will hold a major conference in Tokyo with that theme. The list of points I would have liked to raise here is long indeed â?? our contributions towards the rule of law, our determination to be steadfast in undertaking the Paris Agreement and our policy of addressing global infrastructure demand through quality investments. Moreover, what Japan wants to safeguard in every respect is the free, liberal, open international order and multilateral frameworks. The world certainly holds high expectations towards the United Nations as the flag-bearer upholding those values. That is exactly why the Security Council should be reformed without delay, in response to the demands of the times. Japan will strive, together with its friends, to achieve such reforms. I had intended to state that Japanâ??s abiding determination is to play an active role for world peace as a permanent member of the Security Council. However, I have no choice but to focus my remarks on a single issue, that of North Korea. North Korea conducted a nuclear test on 3 September. Whether or not it was a hydrogen bomb test, its scale far exceeded that of previous tests. Before and after that, on 29 August and again on 15 September â?? before the ink was even dry on Security Council resolution 2375 (2017), adopted to impose sanctions on North Korea â?? North Korea launched missiles. They were launched to fly over Japan and make a display of their cruising range. The gravity of that threat is unprecedented, and it is indisputably a matter of urgency. North Korea is attempting to dismiss with a smirk the efforts towards disarmament we have assiduously undertaken over the years. The non-proliferation regime is about to suffer a serious blow from its most confident disrupter ever. Qualitatively, that recent crisis is of an altogether different dimension than those we have eluded every time that some dictator has attempted to acquire weapons of mass destruction. North Koreaâ??s nuclear weapons either already are, or are on the verge of becoming, hydrogen bombs. Their means of delivery will sooner or later be intercontinental ballistic missile. Over more than 20 years since the end of the Cold War, where and when else, and to what dictators, have we allowed such self-indulgence? As it turns out, it is only towards North Korea that it has been allowed. That is the reality we find before us, and it was absolutely not a lack of dialogue that gave rise to the situation. Dialogue dissuaded North Korea from pursuing its nuclear ambitions. Dialogue has afforded many of us the relief that the world had been saved from a crisis. Believing thus, many of us were relieved â?? not just once, but twice. The first time was in the early 1990s. At the time, the threat that North Korea imposed amounted to little more than openly displaying its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other inspection regimes. However, tensions were felt by those of us that surmised the intent of that. After many twists and turns, in October 1994 what is known as the Agreed Framework was realized between the United States and North Korea. Under that framework, North Korea would be made to abandon its nuclear plans. In exchange, we would provide incentives to North Korea. To that end, Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea formed the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in March the following year. Taking KEDO as the implementing agent, we pledged to build and hand over two light-water reactors to North Korea and to provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil annually as a stopgap measure for its energy demand. Those steps were all carried out accordingly. However, as time went by, it came to be known that North Korea had been continuing steadily with its uranium enrichment. From the start, North Korea had never intended to abandon its nuclear ambitions. That had become readily apparent to all. After 2002, seven years after it was founded, KEDO suspended its operations. During that period, it can be said that North Korea defrauded the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan with regard to assistance. Countries that recognized value in the KEDO framwork of providing incentives to change North Koreaâ??s actions gradually came to join KEDO: the European Union, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Poland, the Czech Republic and Uzbekistan. North Korea betrayed the good faith of all those KEDO members. As one of the organizationâ??s founding members, Japan had pledged to give a non-interest loan to KEDO and had fulfilled roughly 40 per cent of that pledge â?? that is, about $400 million of a $1 billion pledge. The second crisis occurred in 2002, when KEDO suspended its operations and North Korea, saying it would end the freeze on its nuclear-related facilities, expelled IAEA inspectors. The concern was again that North Korea was continuing its uranium enrichment â?? and again we chose the path of defusing the situation through dialogue. North Korea, China, and Russia joined the three founding members of KEDO â?? Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea â?? to launch the Six-Party Talks in August 2003. Subsequently, after two years of twists and turns through the summer of 2005 into autumn, the six parties finally reached an agreement resulting in the release of a joint statement. North Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes and to returning to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards. Moreover, two years later, in February 2007, an agreement was concluded regarding what each of the six parties should do towards implementing the joint statement. A group of IAEA inspectors that had entered North Korea verified the shutdown of the nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon, and in return North Korea received heavy fuel oil. The series of events made people think that, this time, tenaciously continuing dialogue had finally caused North Korea to change its actions. But what actually happened? In February 2005, while the Six- Party Talks were under way, North Korea declared unilaterally that it was already in possession of nuclear weapons. Moreover, in October 2006, it openly carried out its first nuclear test. Its second nuclear test was in 2009. Finally, that same year, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Six-Party Talks, stating it would never again take part in such talks. It was around that time that it was firing ballistic missiles on a repeated basis. Over the course of more than a decade, beginning in 1994, the international community continued its efforts for dialogue with North Korea with great perseverance, first through the Agreed Framework and later through the Six-Party Talks. However, what we had to learn is that during the time that dialogue continued, North Korea had no intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear or missile development. For North Korea, dialogue was instead the best means of deceiving us and buying time. More than anything else, the following fact demonstrates that. In 1994, North Korea had no nuclear weapons, and even its ballistic missile technology was far from mature. Yet it is now working to attain hydrogen bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Again and again, attempts to resolve issues through dialogue have all come to nought. With what hope of success are we repeating the very same failure a third time? We must make North Korea abandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programmess in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. What is needed to do that is not dialogue, but pressure. On 15 November, 40 years will have passed since a 13 year old girl named Megumi Yokota was abducted by North Korea. Megumi and many other abducted Japanese remain in North Korea even to this day. I will continue all possible efforts so they can set foot on Japanâ??s soil as soon as possible. I will continue until the day when they will finally be in the arms of their parents and their family members. Japan will face up to North Koreaâ??s nuclear and missile threat through the Japan-United States alliance and through Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea acting in unity. We consistently support the stance of the United States that all options are on the table. Also, I appreciate the Security Councilâ??s unanimous adoption, on 11 September, of resolution 2375 (2017), which imposes strict sanctions against North Korea. That clarified our intention to further intensify pressure on North Korea in order to force it to undertake a fundamental change in its path forward. But I must make an appeal to the General Assembly. North Korea has already demonstrated its disregard of the resolution by launching yet another missile. The resolution is nothing more than the beginning. We must prevent the goods, funds, people, and technology necessary for nuclear and missile development from heading to North Korea. We must make North Korea comply fully with the repeated resolutions. We must ensure the strict and full implementation of the series of Security Council resolutions by all United Nations States Members. What is necessary is action. Whether or not we can put an end to the provocations by North Korea is dependent upon the solidarity of the international community. There is not much time left. North Korea is in a truly fortunate location, adjoining the growth region of Asia and the Pacific. It has an industrious labour force as well as underground resources. If it were to make use of those, there could be a path for North Korea to dramatically grow its economy and improve public welfare. That is where North Koreaâ??s bright future lies. By failing to resolve the abduction, nuclear weapon and missile issues and by becoming a threat to all humankind, there is absolutely no future that North Korea can open up for itself. In order to change North Koreaâ??s policies, we must strengthen our unity.",1,196
7789,Session 72 - 2017,KAZ_72_2017.txt,KAZ_72_2017,72,2017,KAZ,"In his first statement at the United Nations in October 1992, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, endorsed the concept of preventive diplomacy, an idea that is now a very high priority for the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly. That concept has been instrumental for Kazakhstan, which for the 25 years of its independent development has shown itself to be a proactive and responsible member of the international community. My country has become a net contributor to peace, security and stability, and economic and social development, not only in our region but far beyond. We have worked diligently to preserve peace and harmony in our multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, while stressing and ensuring the equality and dignity of every citizen. We have achieved that while also creating an efficient economic model. Our economy has grown 20 times over, and major international corporations have established and strengthened their presence in Kazakhstan, investing more than $265 billion. This year the Institute for Management Development ranked Kazakhstan thirty-second in world competitiveness, after a remarkable rise of 15 places, and thirty-fifth on its ease-of-doing-business index, 16 places higher. Looking forward, Kazakhstan has a clear vision for its future development. We are aiming to become one of the top 30 most competitive economies in the world by 2050, meeting the most advanced global standards in terms of economic performance and transparent governance, especially those of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A new model of economic growth, Kazakhstanâ??s third modernization, announced by President Nazarbayev in his annual address earlier this year, outlines a path by which our country can achieve those ambitious goals. On the economic front, the third modernization strongly emphasizes Kazakhstanâ??s rapid technological modernization, with a focus on new high-tech industries, information and communication technologies, as well as massive improvements in the business environment, economic productivity, human development and institutional reforms. We have committed resources to streamlining and upgrading our road, rail, airport and pipeline infrastructure and ensured the effective joining of Kazakhstanâ??s national Nurly Zhol programme and Chinaâ??s One Belt, One Road initiative. This year, with a view to building a more efficient, sustainable and modern system of governance, President Nazarbayev initiated constitutional reform in Kazakhstan. The reform, now well under way, is aimed at a major redistribution of powers among its three branches and at further democratizing the political system as a whole. The key steps are the transfer of some presidential powers to Parliament and the Government, and the strengthening of a genuine system of checks and balances. Those economic and political modernization processes will be accompanied by efforts in our quest to modernize Kazakhstanâ??s national identity and cultural code to create conditions for a new generation of competitive and pragmatic citizens and leaders with a thirst for knowledge, progressive consciousness and an open attitude. We are pleased to see that the expanded regional partnership among Central Asian States has enhanced our common capability to withstand threats and challenges. With that in mind, during our current membership of the Security Council, we have been focusing on creating a model of a regional zone of peace, security, development and cooperation in Central Asia. We are also striving to further strengthen regional cooperation and integration among the brother nations of Central Asia in such areas as water management, trade and development, transportation and many others. Kazakhstan is focusing in particular on regional cooperation aimed at tackling the disastrous situation of the Aral Sea. The International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea is still the only permanent platform for dialogue among Central Asiaâ??s Heads of State, and we believe that it could be used to combine our efforts to formulate mid- and long-term strategies for regional development. The agenda of the General Assembly at its current session focuses on people, encompassing issues of sustainable development and peace and security, and stresses our common responsibility for the future. None of us can ignore the tough realities we see on the ground â?? the lack of trust and unity, global and regional inequality and injustice, poverty, xenophobia, conflict, terrorism and extremism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is why this agenda truly reflects the magnitude of the challenges that the United Nations is facing today and at the same time underlines the Organizationâ??s undiminished importance. While the United Nations machinery has indeed been subject to criticism and demands for long-awaited reforms aimed at enhancing its preparedness for crises and response capabilities, the Organization remains a beacon of hope for billions of people across the globe, a universal institution that holds a promise of a better, safer and more sustainable life. We believe that the Secretary-General is on the right track in that regard in his efforts to unite Member States in revitalizing the United Nations. We also support the special meeting on United Nations reform convened on 18 September by United States President Donald Trump, which we believe will be a fresh incentive to turn our Organization into an effective and efficient tool that serves the whole of humankind. Kazakhstan is actively working on establishing and hosting a United Nations regional hub in Almaty for multilateral diplomacy, with a focus on sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disaster risk- reduction and resilience-building in the region and beyond. The initiative is in line with the Secretary- Generalâ??s idea of optimizing the service-delivery of the United Nations and increasing the effectiveness of United Nations field missionsâ?? activities through proper planning and management. My country has continued to pursue the concept of a security and development nexus, while reflecting the intrinsic interdependence of peace, security and development. Sustainable development is unimaginable without peace, and vice versa. When our security architecture is eroded, along with regional confrontations and international terrorism it undermines the achievements that we havemade within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and puts our ability to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in jeopardy. Peace is an integral requirement for social, economic and environmental progress. When we speak of opportunities made possible by global modernization, we must bear in mind the dangers that can prevent all of us from realizing our potential. In our interdependent and connected world, nuclear weapons are no longer an asset, but rather a danger. With moral authority and responsibility based on my nationâ??s bitter experience of hundreds of nuclear tests, my President has stated that eliminating the danger of nuclear weapons is the most urgent task facing humankind in the twenty-first century. That will involve a whole range of important and urgent steps â?? a complete ban on nuclear testing, the total prohibition of nuclear weapons and the complete and verifiable destruction of nuclear arsenals. We are deeply concerned about the nuclear tests being conducted by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea â?? the only State in the twenty-first century that has continued with such tests, despite the condemnation of the entire international community. I want to stress that the actions that the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is taking to further develop its nuclear and missile programmes are totally unacceptable. Pyongyang must take serious steps to restore our trust and must recommit to a much-needed political settlement. In 2009, the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 64/35, thereby designating 29 August â?? the day the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was officially closed in 1991 by the decree of President Nazarbayev â?? as the International Day against Nuclear Tests. That day has been widely commemorated in Kazakhstan and in the United Nations since 2010. This year has also been marked by several events of international significance. From 25 to 29 August, Astana hosted the conference of the Pugwash movement of scientists commemorating the movementâ??s sixtieth anniversary and the International Day against Nuclear Tests, at which hundreds of scholars, practitioners and officials from some 50 countries gathered to seek ways to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world. On that same day, my President and Director General Yukiya Amano, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), opened the IAEA Low- Enriched Uranium Bank facility in Kazakhstan, with a view to making a significant contribution to the uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and strengthening the global non-proliferation regime. At the opening ceremony, President Nazarbayev outlined a number of important initiatives that I would like to share with the Assembly. The first will be to convene a summit of all the States that possess nuclear weapons to collectively discuss further steps towards their nuclear disarmament and the attainment of a nuclear-weapon-free world. The second is to enhance the role of nuclear-weapon-free zones as effective instruments for ending further nuclear proliferation and to combine the efforts of States members of such zones at a meeting in our capital of Astana of representatives of all the nuclear- weapon-free zones. The third is to revive the global nuclear-security summit process and to host the first relaunched nuclear-security summit, also in Astana. The fourth is to call for joint efforts to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is implemented by 2020, which will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Treatyâ??s entry into force. We must improve the coordination of our common response to the barbaric acts of terrorists. Kazakhstan fully supports the efforts of the United Nations in that regard, especially the creation of the Office of Counter- Terrorism, with a view to developing a comprehensive long-term approach. That is in line with the President of Kazakhstanâ??s 2015 proposal for the joint establishment of a global anti-terrorism coalition. My country looks forward to actively and constructively participating in the first-ever meeting of the heads of national counter- terrorism agencies next year with a view to forging a new international counter-terrorism partnership. As a practical contribution to the global partnership in the fight against terrorism, my country has begun to formulate a code of conduct for the achievement of a terrorism-free world as one way to expedite work on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We are also committed to implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and have recently allocated $300,000 for its implementation in Central Asia. Kazakhstan advocates for the broadest possible implementation of multilateral mechanisms and instruments for combating foreign terrorist fighters and shutting down the channels of financial support for their activities through the illegal trade in drugs, natural resources and cultural artefacts. Since there is a wide range of approaches to the issue of controlling Internet content, we believe that the United Nations should take concerted action to prevent the use of the Internet for recruiting and spreading terrorist ideology and radicalizing populations, especially young people. We in Kazakhstan are working on creating a national cybershield system. The unspeakable suffering of millions of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, and the ongoing humanitarian crises and gross violations of human rights in those countries, leave none of us indifferent. Kazakhstan is hosting the Astana process on Syria in order to contribute to the peaceful settlement of the situation there and to promote the United Nations-led negotiations in Geneva, which is the primary forum for those negotiations. We believe that the Astana process, which began earlier this year with the support and direct involvement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, has produced clear, positive results aimed at strengthening the ceasefire regime, creating de-escalation zones and developing a monitoring mechanism. Success in the Geneva and Astana platforms is critical and should be supported by all if we are to save innocent lives in Syria. It is a moral imperative for all of us. Kazakhstan has a clear and consistent position on the Middle East peace process, based on a two- State solution approach. We support a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side in peace with Israel. As an active member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), my country, along with other OIC member States, is a firm defender of the ideal of dialogue among nations and peoples of diverse religious identity. In Astana we recently hosted the OIC Summit on Science and Technology on the margins of the International Exhibition Expo 2017. While the Summit was devoted to science and technology matters, the participants were not in a position to ignore the current suffering of the Rohingya community. The OIC member States condemned those continued violations and called for dialogue among the United Nations, the OIC and the Government of Myanmar to stop the humanitarian crisis. Those events have once again highlighted the relevance of our initiative in establishing the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. Kazakhstan is fully committed to strengthening and improving United Nations peacekeeping activities. We believe that the Secretary-Generalâ??s new approach to peacekeeping reform, with a cross-pillar approach focusing on prevention and sustaining peace, will improve the effectiveness and accountability of peacekeeping operations. We are confident that, if we ensure flexibility and partnerships, they will not only encourage the active involvement and engagement of new countries but could also increase the effectiveness of peace operations. My country is committed to increasing its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping by sending more military observers and staff officers to United Nations missions. We recently declared that we had reached the second level of peacekeeping-unit preparedness for deployment to United Nations peacekeeping missions in the United Nations Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System. Earlier this year I presented President Nazarbayevâ??s policy address to the Security Council. Its seven priorities call for ensuring humankindâ??s survival through a world free of nuclear weapons by 2045 and through the prevention and elimination of military confrontation at the regional and global levels, thereby generating a model for a regional zone of peace, security, cooperation and development in Central Asia. It calls for all stakeholders to work globally to combat international terrorism and extremism, promote peace and security in Africa, implement the SDGs and work for reform of the Security Council and the United Nations system. Kazakhstan will hold the presidency of the Council for the month of January 2018. The major event we are planning during that period will be a high-level open debate on global peace and security. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our invitation to all Member States to participate in the debate at the highest level. Our presidency will focus particularly on security and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia through the prism of Afghanistanâ??s peaceful integration, economically and politically, into regional and global processes. My country remains deeply committed to sustainable development. In the face of the reality of climate change, Kazakhstan, despite its abundant conventional energy resources, is committed to achieving a green economy by diversifying and developing alternative energy sources. That led us to choose â??Future energyâ?? as the theme for the Astana Expo 2017 international exhibition. Throughout the summer, 115 countries and 22 international organizations, including the United Nations, its funds, agencies and programmes, showcased their creative experiences. That enormous undertaking is clear evidence of Kazakhstanâ??s pledge to carry forward the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. One of the best ways to promote a green economy and green business is the use of the legacy of the Expo infrastructure. With the support of five United Nations agencies, we are establishing a â??Future energyâ?? international centre for the development of green technologies and investment projects. Its activities will be in full compliance with Kazakhstanâ??s Green Bridge Partnership Programme, as reflected in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The Expo infrastructure will also house an Astana international financial centre and a centre for information-technology start-ups. We invite all Member States to participate in their activities. As I mentioned earlier, we hosted the first-ever OIC Summit on Science and Technology within the framework of the Expo, an event that underlined the importance of technological modernization in achieving unity and solidarity in the 1.5-billion-strong Islamic world. The high-level meeting, which was attended by 15 presidents and dignitaries from 57 States, emphasized the clear and undeniable link between security and development and recognized that building a sustainable future for our nations is the only way to end challenges and threats to their security. In support of the OICâ??s endeavours, the President of Kazakhstan proposed creating a 15-member OIC forum, similar to the Group of 20, designed to streamline our scientific and economic cooperation. He invited Islamic nations to jointly develop the Expo legacy in the areas of Islamic finance and green technologies, and established a prize for Islamic science and innovations. In conclusion, I would like to stress how vital it is that we preserve peace and stability and ensure the gradual and sustainable development of our fragile world. We do not have the luxury of being able to make mistakes and then going back to correct them. We call on all world leaders to redouble their efforts and their goodwill with the goal of making progress towards lasting peace and prosperity for all.",1,196
7790,Session 72 - 2017,KEN_72_2017.txt,KEN_72_2017,72,2017,KEN,"I am delighted to address the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I convey to all warm greetings and best wishes from the President of the Republic of Kenya, His Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, whom I have the honour to represent here today. The President is committed to the agenda of this session and its overall objectives. I congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his participation for the first time in the General Assembly as Secretary-General. I would say to him that I am encouraged by his commitment to empower the worldâ??s women and girls, because, as he said, â??Parity at the United Nations will improve performance at the United Nationsâ??.  He can count on Kenyaâ??s support for that commitment. The world faces enormous challenges ranging from poverty, global terrorism, climate change, conflicts and inequality, to the unfolding threats to the liberal order that have governed the world in the post-war era. At stake in all those challenges is the well-being of the people, the vast majority of whom are suffering the brunt of those challenges and whose livelihoods are becoming increasingly uncertain. Describing the state of the world at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the English writer Charles Dickens said: â??It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.â?? That is still an apt way of describing the state of the world today with all of its challenges and opportunities. Kenya welcomes the theme of the seventy-second session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Kenya agrees with and supports the priorities for action that the President has outlined to guide the focus on people, namely, peace and conflict prevention; migration; the Sustainable Development Goals; climate action; and human rights. Those priorities are urgent and deserve the attention not only of Governments but also of the private sector and civil society. Kenya acknowledges the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals as an appropriate response to the pressing challenges that we face today. We played a key role in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals as co-Chair of the Open Working Group, and we remain committed to translating that transformative agenda into tangible action for our people without leaving any one behind. However, we recognize that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will be as much about the effectiveness of development cooperation as it will be about the scale and form such cooperation actually takes. There is a lot of talk about partnerships today, but not enough of the practical, on-the-ground support needed to make partnerships effective in practice. As a country, we have stepped up efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In the health sector, for example, our Government now offers free maternal health-care services across our country. We next intend to cover health-care services for women, children and adolescents. Confirming that commitment two years ago, President Kenyatta said: â??I pledge to take the needed sustainable actions to end all preventable deaths of women, children and adolescents within a generation and ensure their well-being, and we hold ourselves accountable for our collective progress towards that goal.â?? Together with the United Nations family in Kenya, we have also established a Sustainable Development Goal partnership platform that seeks to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Kenya. The platform brings together the Government, development partners, the private sector, civil society and the United Nations. The platform has created diverse Sustainable Development Goal accelerator windows, of which primary health care has been the first. That partnership has resulted in a drastic reduction in maternal and child deaths. We intend to transform primary care to pave the way for universal health coverage for all of 46 million Kenyans by 2021, thereby ensuring, as we pledged, that no one is left behind. Climate change in our region is disrupting the livelihoods of millions of people and generating conflicts over dwindling resources, especially land and water. Climate change today costs Kenyaâ??s economy approximately 3 per cent in gross domestic product annually. Kenya has enacted legislation to implement the Paris Agreement in order to address that problem. We have committed to a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, relative to the business-as-usual scenario, and subject to the necessary financing, technology transfer and capacity-building, as agreed in Paris. The capacity of our planet to sustain life is under threat, and the need to address climate change is not a choice; it is an urgent imperative. We commend the United Nations for the steps that have been taken to strengthen and upgrade the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in accordance with the Rio +20 Declaration. We welcome the step towards universal membership and the efforts to enhance the financing and ability of UNEP to fulfil its unique coordination mandate within the United Nations system. I am happy to say that, since its establishment, the United Nations Environment Assembly has helped the world refocus on the environment. Through the work of the Assembly, which is now the de facto world parliament for the environment, decisions that contribute to the well-being of our planet are now being universally respected. I call upon the States Members of the United Nations to strengthen UNEP so that it can effectively respond to global environmental challenges. In that regard, Kenya insists on the implementation of the decision by Heads of State, now enshrined in the Rio Declaration, to consolidate the headquarters functions of UNEP in Nairobi at its headquarters in Kenya. That matter is of grave concern and continues not to receive the attention it deserves. The importance of having UNEP in Kenya, which lies in the global South, cannot be overemphasized. Kenya welcomes the creation of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and looks forward to robust and productive engagement with it. We expect the Office to support all other United Nations bodies in developing initiatives that are responsive to the efforts of Member States. Our priorities are targeted counter-engagement in radicalization clusters, the disengagement of defectors, strengthening intelligence and law enforcement, and deploying whole-of- Government approaches and socioeconomic tools in line with a global strategy. My delegation supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s commitment to the reform agenda of the United Nations. The United Nations must embrace reforms in order to adjust to the global landscape of the twenty-first century and be more accommodative, more democratic and more effective in order to be fit for purpose for our modern world. Of particular concern to Africa is the fact that the Security Council continues to be dominated by a small club of countries, which totally excludes the rest of us. That exclusion continues to undermine the legitimacy and efficiency of the Security Council, while its operations, on the other hand, raise issues of accountability and transparency. Therefore, it is imperative that the United Nations embrace reforms on all of the five core areas that have been identified. We call for Africaâ??s representation in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of the Security Council, as stated in the African Common Position. Early in September, we held a high-level meeting to discuss best practices in relation to implementation of the New Urban Agenda, as well as measures to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, accountability and financial capability of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT). At the meeting, Member States committed to engaging in the UN-HABITAT process. They called for better coordination of urban matters across the entire United Nations system and for an urban assembly to replace the 58-member Governing Council at its headquarters in Nairobi. We welcome the confidence that the membership has expressed in our country. It is no secret that UN-HABITAT is among the least- funded agencies of the United Nations. The Assembly needs an adequate budget in order to enable it to effectively carry out its mandate. Kenya looks forward to engaging constructively in the follow-up discussions in the Second Committee during the current session of the General Assembly. Kenya has played a prominent role in the search for peace and security in various countries, especially in Somalia and South Sudan. Thanks to our collective efforts as an international community, tremendous progress has been made in Somalia. In particular, the credible elections that took place last year and the formation of a broad-based Government marked a watershed moment that laid the foundation for a stable, democratic transition in Somalia. In order to consolidate the gains already made and prevent a relapse into conflict, we support the strengthening of the African Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). We also welcome Security Council resolution 2372 (2017), which extends AMISOM with revised core tasks. We urge the United Nations to give greater support to the Mission, particularly in terms of sustained funding, in order to enable it to deal with major security threats ahead of the envisaged troop drawdown. Furthermore, we strongly believe that support of the reconstruction process, including enabling the Government to provide basic services, will improve confidence and help prevent conflict in Somalia in the future. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan remains of concern and needs urgent attention. We urge the international community to provide much- needed resources in order to help save lives that are being ravaged by famine. It is our expectation that the Government of South Sudan will ensure the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers. We also call on the international community to support the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development revitalization process to re-energize the peace process by bringing together all parties to the conflict. We also remain concerned about the situations in Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria and Iraq. We urge the international community to continue working diligently to ease the challenges that those sisterly nations face. In the same vein, we support the Secretary-Generalâ??s continued efforts to find a lasting solution for the Palestinian people, based on a two- State solution. Since the 1960s, Kenya has hosted huge numbers of refugees from neighbouring countries. We have been generous hosts, but lately the presence of refugees has brought attendant challenges. Those challenges include smuggling, banditry, human trafficking and the infiltration of refugee camps by terrorists. In the light of those challenges, the Kenyan Government, together with the Somali Federal Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and without abdicating its responsibility for refugees, signed a tripartite agreement on the voluntary repatriation of refugees in 2013. Although it has been moving slowly, the repatriation process has since been conducted in conformity with international obligations. We expect the international community to join hands with us in supporting the initiative, as it will enable refugees to rebuild their lives and regain their human dignity, away from the squalor of refugee camps. Kenya welcomes the Presidentâ??s decision to convene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. As a country, we enacted the Counter Trafficking in Persons Act in 2010, which domesticated the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, including its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. That high-level meeting will provide a much- needed, integrated global platform to increase public awareness, share good practices and address loopholes that aid slavery and trafficking, including ensuring effective border management, capacity-building for immigration officers and the efficient monitoring of local and international employment agencies. Kenya welcomes the historic adoption on 7 July of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Although nuclear-weapon States are absent, the overwhelming majority of Member States support the Treaty. That demonstrates our concerns about the danger that the use of such weapons poses to humankind, about which we were all reminded by the unfortunate nuclear detonation that took place on 3 September. The adoption of the Treaty gives us renewed hope that it is possible, if we work together, to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Finally, Kenya is a firm believer in multilateralism. We acknowledge the remarkable role that the United Nations has played in sustaining peace in our world and in providing a global platform for cooperation and solidarity among nations. We know that the United Nations can do better. We believe that the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda for Sustainable Development have given the United Nations a blueprint for creating greater peace in our world and for making globalization and development fair and equitable for all. That is the future that we want for ourselves and for future generations.",1,196
7791,Session 72 - 2017,KGZ_72_2017.txt,KGZ_72_2017,72,2017,KGZ,"At the outset, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people of Mexico following the catastrophic earthquake there. My ancient people have gone through a long and difficult journey of historical development and formation. Centuries ago, we developed our own written language and established our own multi-ethnic State known to history as the Great Kyrgyz Khanate. Unfortunately, subsequent historical events led to the loss of the Khanate and the destruction of the greater part of our people. We used to be referred to as a vanishing ethnic group. Accordingly, freedom, independence and a sovereign State became our national ideals and an impassioned driving force for our people throughout their historic journey. That journey culminated in 1991 in our achievement of sovereignty. However, our struggle for freedom, democracy and justice continue. I am proud of my freedom-loving people, who in the past 12 years have executed two popular revolutions against a dictatorial regime and have shown that the only true source of power in the Kyrgyz Republic is the people. â??In other countries similar events could have led to the destruction of democracy and entailed significant strife, but the Kyrgyz people underwent difficult circumstances and preserved their democracy, which I hope will serve as a model for other countries.â?? Those are the words of the Secretary-General, and we are eternally grateful to Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres for his balanced assessment of historic events during our countryâ??s most recent past. Like all other countries that have chosen the path of sustainable development, the Kyrgyz Republic is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The well-being and prosperity of humankind is our main goal. Despite the impact of the global economic and financial crisis, the decline in energy prices and the sanctions-based standoff of the global Powers, the gross domestic product of the Kyrgyz Republic has been steadily growing for the past few years, and our currency, the Kyrgyzstan som, is one of the most stable of the countries that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States. We are embarking on several major projects, including the improvement of our infrastructure. We have achieved energy independence and a stable energy sector. The Kyrgyz Republic, a country that once went nowhere, has reinvented itself as a country of transit. We are meeting all of our commitments with respect to the social fabric of the country. Salaries for teachers and doctors are on the rise, and pensions and other social benefits are also gradually increasing. Over the past five years, the rate of extreme poverty among the population has decreased by a factor of 4.5. We have begun a meaningful and systematic campaign to rid the Government of the scourge of corruption, in particular at the top levels of power. In our country, the privileged circles and untouchables of six or seven years ago no longer exist. We are engaged in dialogue today on equal terms with all our international partners. As we build our independence in foreign policy, we base it exclusively on protecting our national interests, with special priority for regional integration. The borders that we share with our neighbours are becoming gateways to friendship and good neighbourliness. Our main achievements in recent years have been peace, consensus and stability. The country is changing before our eyes. The Kyrgyz Republic is the first and only country in the post-Soviet Central Asian region with a parliamentary democracy. International organizations, including the United Nations, recognize the Kyrgyz Republic as one of the most free and stable States with a strong civil society in Eurasia. One achievement of particular note is the introduction of a new electoral model using biometric technologies to identify voters and count votes electronically. We successfully used that system in the 2015 parliamentary elections and in a referendum held last year. The democratic process and openness that characterized the electoral campaign in the Kyrgyz Republic were validated by international observers and, most important, by the countryâ??s political partiesâ?? acceptance of their outcome. Campaigning is now in full gear for the presidential elections to be held on 15 October. In our view, fair and transparent elections are crucial to our countryâ??s stability, and we are determined to achieve that. I firmly believe that our newly elected Government will continue to advance its development as a democratic and open State. Kyrgyzstan is currently developing a long-term national strategy for sustainable development through 2040. Our strategic goals for future sustainable development include accelerated economic development that provides people with decent jobs; ensuring economic and social well-being; public security and a high quality of life; and developing a parliamentary democracy and a strong civil society. One of the key initiatives of that strategy is the â??Clean Societyâ?? Taza Koom initiative, designed to develop and promote the principles of electronic Government and open society in our country. During his visit to my country, Secretary-General Guterres noted that the Kyrgyz Republic is not only a pioneer of democracy in Central Asia, it is also becoming a pioneer in building a digital environment as well as a digital economy. Based on all the steps that we have taken, I believe that in the near future the Kyrgyz Republic will become an economically developed, socially prosperous and secure country with a developed agro-industrial complex and manufacturing potential. It will be a secure country that will be safe to live and visit in a framework of sustainable tourism, supported by its membership in the Mountain Partnership, with its unique natural, historical and cultural monuments along the great Silk Road. It will be a country of healthy, educated, cultured, free and prosperous people governed by a fair and accountable leadership. The year 2040 will mark 1,200 years since the advent of the Kyrgyz Khanate in the tenth century, when Kyrgyz statehood reached its apex. We owe it to both our history and our future to reach 2040 as a strong, self-reliant and highly developed State. The consequences of climate change now threaten all of us to some degree, and mountainous countries such as the Kyrgyz Republic are on the front lines, owing to the complex ecosystems associated with such terrain. The problems of climate change are having an impact on every sector of the Kyrgyz Republicâ??s economy and are causing significant damage from increasingly frequent natural disasters in mountainous areas, including mudflows, landslides, floods and avalanches. We are particularly concerned about the accelerated melting of Kyrgyz glaciers, which are natural reservoirs and a source of fresh water not only for Central Asia but for the whole world. According to forecasts, by 2025 the total glacier area in the Kyrgyz Republic could decrease by 30 to 40 percent, which could lead to a drop in the water levels of Central Asian rivers. By 2100 the glaciers of the Kyrgyz Republic could vanish altogether. Our country is therefore promoting the implementation of joint projects to preserve glaciers in mountain ecosystems of upstream countries. The basic essence of the transition to sustainable development is a matter of the survival of humankind and the preservation of the biosphere. Due to climate change, various rare animals and the biodiversity of our mountain ecosystems are threatened with extinction. In particular, since the nineties, the global population of snow leopards has fallen by half. In 2013, we initiated and conducted the Global Snow Leopard Forum, marking the start of a noble mission: to make preserving that species and its ecosystem a single strategic nature environmental task. Only three weeks ago in Bishkek, we held the second International Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Forum. One of its main outcomes was a proposal by the Kyrgyz Republic to initiate a multi-country project at the regional level, with an emphasis on preserving our national and, no less important, global biodiversity. In the modern world, mankind is forgetting its origins. In a chaotically fragmented world with increasing divisions, all nations need unifying factors and ideas rather than political ideas that divide peoples over religious beliefs or language. In that regard, our country has come up with a whole range of international projects and measures. In particular, to showcase the greatness of the nomadic civilization to the international community, the Kyrgyz Republic has launched a unique project, the World Nomad Games. The General Assembly provided international recognition for this project for its contribution to intercultural dialogue. Next year, we will be hosting the third Nomad Games, and we invite everyone to participate in them. In July, we held an international forum on â??Altai civilization and related peoples of the Altaic language familyâ??. Its main goal was the development and popularization of common heritage and cultural exchange between peoples having common Altai roots, strengthening and expanding cooperation among the States belonging to the Altaic language family. The international conference initiated by my country on the theme â??Islam and the modern secular Stateâ?? is dedicated to the strengthening of peace and the development of intercultural dialogue. It will be held on 28 and 29 September in Bishkek. We believe it is important to study experiences and exchange information on the interaction of the State and religious institutions and civil societies in secular countries. All those initiatives represent a contribution by the Kyrgyz Republic to the preservation of peace and stability and the development of cultural diversity and tolerance as a counterweight to contemporary threats of terrorism and radicalism, and we believe that they will have fruitful results. One of the key factors in good living standards in Central Asia is our mutually beneficial use of water and energy resources. The Kyrgyz Republic has consistently advocated the development and introduction in the region of economic mechanisms for water use. The worldâ??s limited water resources will sooner or later lead to an understanding that water is an economic resource that requires reasonable use. I wish to emphasize in particular that water-use issues in Central Asia can and should be solved only by the States of the region through an open and constructive dialogue, taking into account the interests and needs of all countries. It is unacceptable for international and regional organizations to impose their own approaches and ways of developing cooperation in this area on the countries of Central Asia. I would be remiss if I did not mention the problem of managing the numerous uranium tailings in the Kyrgyz Republic that we inherited from the Soviet Union. They pose a threat to the entire region. We all know that a number of large uranium-tailing dump sites are located in close proximity to rivers and water sources. In the event of an accidents at a tailing site, pollution of the regionâ??s rivers with highly toxic waste could lead to large-scale ecological and humanitarian consequences and would imperil the lives and health of millions of people and even socioeconomic development in every Central Asian country. That is why, in 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic initiated a proposal to adopt a special resolution on the matter of the uranium legacy in Central Asia, and the General Assembly adopted that text as resolution 68/218 in 2013. In the past five years we have made significant progress in solving problems of radiation and environmental safety. Now we see that it is time for a new Assembly resolution that takes account of the results that have been achieved. Today, here in New York, we will be having a special meeting on the issue, initiated by the Kyrgyz Republic and others. We believe that the meeting will enable us to come up with new programmes and joint measures aimed at recultivating uranium-tailing sites. With regard to matters of peace and security and the sustainable development of all countries on the planet, I also want to mention the problem of terrorism. The international community must step up its efforts to fight terrorism, extremism and related problems such as illegal drug trafficking, trafficking in humans and arms, and money laundering. Unfortunately, the international communityâ??s measures have been inadequate and have sometimes led to confrontation between States, while it is only by joint action and efforts that we can effectively counter the threats of terrorism and extremism. I should not omit to mention the current situation in Myanmar and the plight of the Muslims there. Kyrgyzstan resolutely condemns the violence being perpetrated against the ethnic minority in Myanmar, and we earnestly call on all parties to the conflict to engage in peaceful negotiations. We also urge all countries around the globe to uphold their commitment to the provisions of the international conventions on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is encouraging to see the increasing role that the United Nations is playing in our collective efforts to confront the challenges and threats that we face today. But as that role increases, so does its accountability. It is the 15 members of the Security Council that currently decide the fate of the world. The consensus they reach determines matters of war and peace, security and stability in various parts of our planet. Moreover, the five permanent members of the Council can always block any decision. Kyrgyzstan therefore advocates the adoption of urgent measures to improve the Security Council that will enable it to take into consideration the interests of a majority of States. Our world will continue to develop and change. It will continue to confront difficulties and crises, make breakthroughs and have successes in development. But all of us are united by the desire to preserve peace and concord on Earth. For that to happen, we need to provide equitable conditions and possibilities for development in every country, so that no one is left behind or left to cope with troubles and problems alone. Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Change Agreement and other agreements on the international agenda must remain the main priority of our joint action as an international community. Only together can we build a world based on cultural diversity; on dialogue, not sanctions; on preventive measures and greater accountability; a world where no one will be forgotten or left behind. So let us unite our efforts and help all people on Earth to live better and attain even a little more joy. Together we can build a world that provides a dignified life for everyone on our planet Earth. (spoke in Kyrgyz; translation provided by the delegation) As I end my speech, I would now like to address my beloved Kyrgyz people, my dear compatriots, in Kyrgyz. A thousand years later, the Kyrgyz nomads have found their way again. For us to find that way, thousands of our forefathers had to sacrifice their lives and thousands of our mothers were left blinded by grief. Are there any mountains where no Kyrgyz bones are buried? Are there any valleys where no Kyrgyz blood has flowed? In a few daysâ?? time, the Kyrgyz people will elect their new leader. Let us not lose our way by following the oligarchs and leaders of other countries. We cannot let others trample on Kyrgyz leaders ever again. We cannot let our national wealth and our lands be sold off or given away again while ordinary people suffer. Let us not be deceived by money. Let us not be deceived by fancy words. Let us not look deceitfully at one another. Let us be honest with one another. We must preserve our dignity and our unity. We must preserve our motherland. We must preserve our people.",1,196
7792,Session 72 - 2017,KHM_72_2017.txt,KHM_72_2017,72,2017,KHM,"On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia and on my own behalf, I congratulate you, Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji. for his commitment and dedication to the work of the previous session. I join previous speakers in expressing my deepest condolences and sympathy to the victims of the earthquake in Mexico and their families. My delegation finds the theme of this session of the General Assembly extremely relevant. It appropriately sums up the six overarching priorities of the presidency, which respond to the global megatrends currently facing our world. The interaction between population growth, massive migration movement, climate change and food insecurity renders these megatrends all the more worrisome. Similarly, the same forces of globalization that in the past have made us so interdependent are exposing deep flaws in the existing international order. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world has become, by many measures, more complex and challenging than ever before. Today, our world is increasingly multipolar, which creates chaos and turbulence as the competition between the major Powers becomes more confrontational. We are more interdependent but more unequal; we are more prosperous and yet millions are still afflicted with poverty. All these factors have contributed to a sense of a world out of balance, and that is the paradox that defines our world today. While we share the deep concern about the situation on the Korean peninsula, we appeal to all the parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid provocative activities and remain committed to peaceful and constructive dialogue so as to defuse tension and promote trust and confidence in the region. Another factor destabilizing collective security is the unilateral and illegal embargo on Cuba. We ask that this violation of international law be brought to an end. While it is true that globalization and technological progress have dramatically increased global trade and wealth all over the world, it is equally true that they have been factors in the increases we are seeing in inequality, social tensions and, sometimes, conflicts. To a large extent, those fragilities are responsible for many of todayâ??s conflicts and threats. One of those threats is terrorism, from which no country is spared. Defeating that transnational threat requires a firm global resolve to comprehensively address it in all its forms, starting with the symptoms and root causes of radicalization and confronting the issues of foreign fighters and financing for terrorism and other forms of support. Let me touch on two topics of relevance to the theme of this session of the General Assembly, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and climate change. The 2030 Agenda is inextricably linked to many of the issues that perturb the world today, the most pressing being climate change, which is not only a direct threat in itself but is also a multiplier of many other threats â?? from poverty, diseases and food insecurity to mass migrations and regional conflicts. In our view, climate change is a global human security issue that presents a serious and unprecedented threat to global peace and security more generally. Cambodia is regularly ranked among the top 10 most vulnerable countries globally, with extreme weather events damaging our infrastructure, severely affecting agriculture, disrupting economic activities and hampering crucial social services for our vulnerable groups. While our contribution to climate change is negligible and our domestic resources quite limited, we have nonetheless made clear commitments to low- carbon development and look forward to developing partnerships with other progressive nations that are committed to addressing this formidable challenge cooperatively and fairly. I am pleased to note that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change acknowledges the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, meaning that they are based on countriesâ?? respective capabilities and varying national conditions. Indeed, the 2030 Agenda is our boldest agenda for humankind and it is aimed at fostering fair globalization. Cambodia has demonstrated its commitment to sustainable development over the past two decades. Specifically, our target of reducing the poverty rate to 19.5 per cent by 2015 was achieved ahead of schedule. We have received a United Nations award for halving hunger before the deadline. Cambodia is also among the top seven performers globally for its improvements in the Human Development Index between 1990 and 2015. 26/27 17-29722 With regard to peace and security, Cambodia is proud of its unwavering commitment to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. More than two decades ago Cambodia received United Nations Blue Berets deployed on their peacekeeping mission. Since 2006, we have dispatched more than 4,700 troops to take part with great and commendable success in United Nations peacekeeping missions in a number of hotspots in the world, such as the Sudan, South Sudan, Lebanon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Syria and Mali. As all delegations know, peacekeeping operations are not without security risks. Peacekeepers continue to come under attack from armed groups and increasingly from terrorists. In May, rebel ambushes in the Central African Republic killed and wounded our Cambodian peacekeepers. Let us pay tribute to those who have died while serving under the United Nations flag and remind ourselves to acknowledge their contributions in the transformation of many countries from battlefields to peaceful States. I now wish to address the issues of human rights and democracy, since my country is regularly targeted in that regard by some countries and United Nations agencies, as well as by international non-governmental organizations active in these areas. Cambodia upholds the universal principle that we all possess fundamental human rights. We therefore see no incompatibility between national sovereignty, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and international monitoring of the application of those rights, provided that it is impartial and takes all pertinent factors on the ground into account, and that observers harbour no prejudice or prejudgement against democratically elected authorities. Now, what is the reality? To get straight to the point, assessments of human rights situations vary according to the political predispositions of certain great Powers. The same reasoning holds true for some big international non-governmental organizations whose agendas are far from politically neutral. The issue of human rights and democracy comes up only when the specific interests of certain major Powers are at stake, depending on the vagaries of the moment. Otherwise, all we hear is total and often complicit silence. My country suffered from the deliberate political instrumentalization of human rights and democracy for more than 12 years, during which time the international community denied the existence of the most terrible mass crimes. Today, as a survivor of the genocidal Pol Pot regime, I am pained and shocked to hear the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia refer to the crimes perpetrated by that regime as mere disturbances. We are subject to incessant criticism on matters that are reported in a partial and biased manner. Those reports always blame the Government and portray the opposition as martyrs of democracy and human rights. They invariably and exclusively target the Government, while the wrongdoings and illegal behaviour of the opposition are never or rarely mentioned. What country represented in the General Assembly would refrain from acting when opposition politicians incite people to remove border posts, ignite vile hysteria with racist remarks and publish false treaties and fake maps to make people believe that some parts of the country have been annexed by neighbouring States? What country endorses defamation and slander? In most countries, incitements to racial hatred, xenophobic statements and speeches of the extreme right are severely denounced or even condemned, as we have just seen with the events of Charlottesville. While such actions are the daily language of the Cambodian opposition, they have never been condemned or raised by non-governmental organizations or the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia. The latest attacks on the Royal Government of Cambodia pertain to the expulsion of an institute affiliated with a foreign political party that, under the cover of democracy training, deliberately supports the opposition and violates our law; the closure of a tax delinquent foreign newspaper; and the arrest of an opposition leader who, in a recorded interview, confessed to being an agent of a major Power working to overthrow the Government. In what country would such behaviour by a foreign Government be tolerated? We have not acted arbitrarily but rather completely in accord with provisions of our specific laws. We can learn an important lesson from the history of my country. When we were forced to choose a path set by some Western Powers, Cambodia ended up suffering one of the most horrific human tragedies of the last century. We must recognize that it was the Cambodian Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen and with its own homegrown methods, that secured peace for the country in 1998. It was a striking demonstration of the fact that certain practices imposed from the outside are often part of the problem rather than the solution. Today we are accused of undermining democracy because, under existing laws, we are prosecuting and punishing people who violate the law. Those who criticize or even threaten us refuse to take into consideration the crimes committed by those whom they protect. While acknowledging with sincere gratitude the very positive and important contributions of many countries to peace and economic development in our country, I would like to conclude by affirming that the discourse of certain Governments concerning human rights and democracy will be relevant and credible only when those countries first apply to themselves the same standards of treatment that they apply to their assessments, criticisms and condemnations of others.",1,196
7793,Session 72 - 2017,KIR_72_2017.txt,KIR_72_2017,72,2017,KIR,"I bring warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am very honoured and humbled to address this gathering. In our traditional way and in the Lordâ??s name, I share with the General Assembly blessings and peace. May all be blessed. I join previous speakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. You have an important responsibility to chart and lead the course of our work during this session, and I am confident that, under your able leadership, we will achieve the goals and targets set for this session based on the theme â??Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Please be assured of our full support and cooperation. I join others in commending and acknowledging with gratitude and pride the marvellous leadership of your predecessor and our Pacific brother, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji. As this is our new Secretary-Generalâ??s first general debate, I extend to him our heartfelt congratulations on his assumption of the leadership of our Organization, and acknowledge his unwavering commitment to reforming the United Nations in order to make it more inclusive and responsive to the contemporary global realities facing its Member States. I congratulate you, Sir, on the theme you have chosen for this session. It serves as a reminder to us of two of the great wonders of creation: our people and our planet. They are giving rise, however, to great concern both for today and for tomorrow. People are the fundamental foundations of our families, our societies, our nations and our planet, bound together by strong human values and a strong faith in God. The theme reminds us of our important responsibility as leaders to ensure that human lives, human dignity and human values must prevail over dollar value. We must make sure we serve and deliver on our main objective as a global family to provide a peaceful and secure world without nuclear weapons and promote social progress, better living standards, human rights and dignity for all our citizens. We all want to live a happy life on a safe and sustainable planet. As leaders of our sovereign nations we are responsible for our people, who are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Every year, we converge in this Hall from all corners of our planet to represent the voices of our people, to share their triumphs and tribulations and to share our visions for them and for our planet. The voices we represent at this gathering are constant and dominated by messages of trials and challenges with varying degrees of urgency and intensity. In recent years we have continued to witness human suffering around the world as a result of armed conflicts, terrorism, persecution, corruption, climate change and natural disaster, to name but a few. Over the past few weeks we also have witnessed, through the media, heartbreaking news of the loss of lives and extensive devastation in the Caribbean, Mexico and the United States caused by the unprecedented and continued onslaught of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria, as well as an earthquake. While they have not been as widely reported as the hurricanes and earthquakes in the Americas, the intense typhoons and monsoons in Asia have also caused great human suffering and loss. On behalf of the people and Government of Kiribati, I offer our heartfelt condolences and prayers to all victims of those natural tragedies as they try to rebuild their lives after the loss of their loved ones and their homes. We deal with human suffering in countries affected by rapid-onset disasters, but we must not forget the plight of those in countries such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives and other small island developing States, who continue to suffer on a daily basis from the impact of the slow-onset climate disaster. It may not be capturing the attention of the global community, owing to its slow impact and to limited media attention, but it is causing great pain and suffering in our communities. During this seventy-second session and in view of our theme, the United Nations should focus on the most vulnerable and underprivileged members of our global family, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States. We must provide them with special attention and support so that they can achieve self-sufficiency and enjoy decent and dignified lives. We must make sure they are not left behind in our global journey towards achieving the global development agenda. We must provide a platform on which they can participate meaningfully in international processes that affect their lives. We must make sure their voices are heard. International processes and systems must be simplified and streamlined so as to enable enhanced participation and easy access to global resources like the Green Climate Fund. Above all else, human lives and dignity must be protected. We must celebrate and build on the diversity of our people, our rich cultures and values. We must respect each other and work together to overcome global challenges and unlock global potential. Like others, Kiribati looks forward to a day when we will have a different story to tell to our children and our childrenâ??s children â?? a story without heartbreaking human suffering and loss; a story of success and joy. That story must start with the major transformation of our homes, our societies, our nations and our world but, most importantly, with the immediate transformation of our hearts. That is the main source of our global problems. My Government is embarking on an ambitious transformative 20-year vision for Kiribati towards becoming a wealthy, healthy and secure nation based on accelerated growth and strategic investment in our human, natural and cultural capital. Our priority sectors in the immediate term are fisheries and tourism, with an anticipated boost in our national income levels to help finance our development priorities. Our intervention is targeted at empowering our people at the household and community levels. They are the foundation on which our nation is based. The stronger the foundation, the more resilient and more self-sufficient our nation can be. My Government has put in place income-generation programmes to boost household income levels in order to address poverty and hardship in our society and provide an opportunity for a decent and dignified life for our people. Our Governmentâ??s policy is to serve and deliver to our people based on the principles of good governance and transparency. We have established a parliamentary select committee on anti-corruption. We have enacted a leadership code and put in place the necessary regulations and arrangements for the establishment of a leadership commission next year. Before I left Kiribati earlier this week, I launched our first-ever national anti-corruption strategy covering the public sector, the private sector and civil society. Nurturing and developing a decent life for all requires genuine and inclusive partnerships. We acknowledge existing partnerships and look forward to establishing new ones. We cannot talk about focusing on people and creating a decent life for all if our United Nations family is incomplete or unbalanced. Every year, we pledge to consolidate and act together to provide a better life for our people, yet we choose to ignore the 23 million people in Taiwan and deprive them of the right to be part of this global family and to participate and contribute meaningfully to the sustainable development agenda. We call for a reform programme that will see Taiwan included in our global familyâ??s efforts and drive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Our planet is struggling to keep up with our insatiable greed and demands. We are stretching our planetâ??s capacity to dangerous limits. Continuing with unsustainable patterns of production and consumption will undoubtedly push our planetâ??s life-support system to the brink of collapse. The warning signs of unprecedented natural events, bringing despair and havoc in their wake, should serve as confirmation of the poor health of our planet. With lessons learned from the damage we have caused to our atmosphere, we must ensure that we act urgently and collectively to conserve our ocean so that we do not repeat the same mistake we made with our atmosphere. I am encouraged to note item 77 on the agenda of the General Assembly, which proposes, among other things, the formulation of an internationally legally binding instrument for the management and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. That is crucial for Kiribati and other countries that rely heavily on revenue from fisheries. A single management failure in any such fisheries area, or any other part of the ocean, could have devastating consequences, not just for the fisheries of a nearby exclusive economic zone but potentially for the fisheries of the entire ocean. Fishing revenue accounts for about 80 per cent of our current budget. I cannot emphasize enough the impact of such an issue on the ambitious vision by which, 20 years from now, Kiribati aspires to implement a self-reliance strategy to harvest, process and market its own tuna. The ocean has a strong connection to the people and to peace and prosperity. Kiribati has played its part in the conservation and management of the ocean by declaring 11 per cent of its total exclusive economic zone as a marine protected area, a non-commercial zone and a world heritage entity under UNESCO, with the aim of enabling the re-stocking of fisheries resources for the future. We have also declared our entire exclusive economic zone a shark sanctuary. If a small, resource-constrained nation like mine is willing to make such a profound sacrifice, affecting its own economy and a resource for the entire world that its people rely on every day for a living, this global family certainly has a far greater capacity to do more and make sacrifices that focus on people, so that our children and their children can build a decent life in a sustainable environment. In spite of all those challenges, we remain steadfast in our strong development aspirations and vision for our people. We need swift global action on climate change and we require support to mitigate and alleviate the suffering of our people. We are grateful for the support of all our development partners in our efforts to address the impact of climate change on our people in areas such as water and sanitation, coastal protection of our water resources, our critical public infrastructure and farmland. Access to climate financing such as the Green Climate Fund takes too long to process and disburse. The longer the delay in delivering that much needed financing for urgent adaptation, the greater the cost to our people and environment. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer. As part of my Governmentâ??s plan, Kiribati Vision 20, we have decided to take charge of our fate and put in place innovative financing modalities. That will enable us to fast-track financing support for our sustainable development agenda, especially in relation to climate change and disaster risk management. With the approval of Parliament, my Government is leveraging our sovereign wealth fund as collateral for concessional debt financing. Ideally, the Government will be looking at concessional debt financing with an interest rate of 1 to 2 per cent, to be repaid when climate or adaptation financing is available. We are currently earning about a 6 per cent return on our investment. That is a move beyond traditional and conventional roles, but we would rather take the initiative to drive our own aspirations and deliver to our people, than wait for financial assistance that may come at a moment far too late. The fate of humankind and life must not be mortgaged to the bureaucratic processes of financial institutions. In conclusion, as leaders of this global family, we have a moral responsibility to focus on the people we serve, strive for peace and a decent life for all and make sure the health of the planet is sustained so that it can continue to support life. In our quest for sustainable development, we often focus on the economic fundamentals at the expense of human values. For so long, our focus has been diverted from the very purpose of this global family to our individual fights and quest for power, dominance and greed. In the process, we fail to recognize that for some members of this global family, their priority is simply to survive and provide a decent life and future for their children. The compassion and love that exist within all of us can easily transform our global challenges by focusing on the most vulnerable members of our global family. We contemplate how we can best find grand solutions, when all we really need is to translate the meaning of family into what it stands for â?? love, compassion, respect, understanding and kindness. Those are priceless solutions to the mounting problems that we continue to battle. We come to this gathering to listen and converse, and let us do so with greater compassion, understanding, love, respect and kindness. As the saying goes, it is never too late to start. Lastly, I share with those present, all our heart, love and traditional blessing: Te mauri, te raoi ao te tabomoa, which means â??health, peace and prosperity to us allâ??. God bless all our people. God bless our United Nations leaders and our United Nations family and God bless our shared home, our planet.",1,196
7794,Session 72 - 2017,KNA_72_2017.txt,KNA_72_2017,72,2017,KNA,"I bring greetings from the Government and the people of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. I wish at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to assure you of my delegationâ??s full support as you carry out your duties. Permit me also to extend congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. President Thomson ably steered the deliberations on many pressing matters during this past year. As a representative of Fiji, he proved once again that small island nations continue to make significant contributions to matters of global relevance. I also extend a warm welcome to Secretary-General Guterres as he assumes leadership of the Organization. His Excellency has come to the helm at a critical time in our collective history, and we are confident that his competence, coupled with his political and diplomatic experience, will enable him to chart the course of the Organization towards a sustainable and peaceful future for all. I assure His Excellency of my Governmentâ??s fullest support and commitment. My delegation also expresses appreciation to former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his sterling service and wishes him well in his future endeavours. The world has gathered here in New York at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly under the theme â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. The theme is comprehensive, yet simple; concise, yet inclusive; and it encompasses pivotal and pertinent areas for international reflection at this critical juncture in our history. Permit me to begin where the theme ends â?? a sustainable planet. I choose to do so because of the experience that I and members of our Caribbean civilization had immediately prior to leaving our countries to attend this session of the General Assembly. In the space of two weeks, we braced ourselves for the three hurricanes Irma, Jose and Maria. Two of these, Irma and Maria, descended on our region as category 5 hurricanes and, in the case of Irma, as the most powerful storm in recorded history in the Atlantic. I pause to reflect on the fact that the hurricane season of 2017 is not yet over and that the Caribbean will face similar threats each and every year. In the aftermath, we were faced with the tragic destruction of life, property and infrastructure in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Cuba, the Turks and Caicos islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe and Dominica. Irma then made landfall in Florida in the United States, where, like Hurricane Harvey before it in Texas and Louisiana, millions of people were subject to damage and destruction. I have highlighted the various countries and territories that suffered the most devastation, but my own beloved country of Saint Kitts and Nevis was not without injury. We, too, saw damage to our power grid, our roads, our agriculture and fisheries sector and to the homes of our people. Indeed, on 19 September, the day we should have been celebrating the thirty-fourth anniversary of our independence as a nation, Saint Kitts and Nevis was locked down under assault from Hurricane Maria. The carnage in a wide swath of the Caribbean is unimaginable. Lives have been lost, homes and infrastructure destroyed, economies reduced to tatters, and years of development wiped out; in the case of Barbuda, an entire island was evacuated and rendered uninhabited and uninhabitable for the first time in 300 years. It is worthy of note that the carnage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria took but a few days. In just a few days and in many countries a mere few hours, the world had front-row seats to the most horrific destruction ever seen in our beloved Caribbean region. We have in this Hall heard the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda speak solemnly of the utter destruction of Barbuda (see A/72/PV.14). It was only today that we stood in anguished silence as the Prime Minister of Dominica recounted the near total destruction of his beautiful country and the tragic loss of life (see A/72/PV.19). Their first-hand accounts would move even the coldest hearts to tears. We today extend our deep condolences to our brothers and sisters and continue to keep them in our prayers. But even as we do so, we also remember the victims of the three horrific earthquakes in Mexico and those in Japan and New Zealand. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the Governments and the peoples of those countries. The time has now come for the world to treat these phenomena not as natural disasters but as the man-made disasters that they are. The science is irrefutable. Our oceans continue to get warmer due to our continued abuse of our planet Earth. Warmer oceans feed and create horrific storms such as Irma and Maria. Now more than ever, we bear witness to the compelling need to support the call for a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and all other actions and behaviours that aggravate the effects of climate change. Climate change for us in the Caribbean is not a matter for academic rumination. The humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria is stark testimony to the fact that climate change is not only real but poses an existential threat to our peoples, our countries and our civilization. The world has deliberated and negotiated. We have made commitments and signed multiple agreements, most recently the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, but the time for more urgent, concrete, tangible and collective action is now. It is the most cruel irony of our times that we in the Caribbean, who are least responsible for climate change, are the ones most disastrously affected by it. We are not major polluters, but we bear the brunt of the effects of pollution. In every sense, small vulnerable States like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and my own Saint Kitts and Nevis continue to be asked by the world to cash a cheque we did not write. In order to attain a sustainable planet, those most responsible for climate change through their greenhouse gas emissions and other environmentally harmful practices must shoulder the responsibility of arresting and ameliorating the consequences. We cannot continue to abuse our planet and expect to remain unscathed. The people of Saint Kitts and Nevis call upon the global community to pledge itself to pursue renewable energy with greater alacrity. We must invest in better and stronger homes and buildings. We must grow our economies to allow us greater financial resilience and flexibility. The people of Saint Kitts and Nevis and of our Caribbean deserve and demand the same fundamental right to life and security of our way of life as others anywhere else. I ask the global community to lend its collective voice so that together we can create a glorious symphony for change â?? change that will ensure a sustainable planet for all. In this regard, I call on the community of nations to mobilize the resources necessary to ensure the speedy reconstruction of those countries devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. My delegation unreservedly condemns the sterile analysis of gross domestic product per capita, which has been used by international agencies to tell our small island developing States that we are now middle- and high-income countries and therefore locked out of accessing development assistance or affordable financing. It is a travesty and a tragedy for the world community to witness such destruction caused by forces entirely outside the control of Caribbean nations and then refuse to allow those very nations access to the resources necessary to rebuild. There has to be a more sensible and just model that takes into account the special vulnerability of small island States. Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore joins others in demanding that a vulnerability index be developed as part of the matrix for accessing development assistance. We of the Caribbean, already caught in the debt trap, cannot be forced to borrow commercially at high interest rates to rebuild destroyed lives after each disaster. This is and must be a moral imperative for us all in the wake of the destruction seen in the Caribbean. And rebuild we must. Countries such as Dominica have no safe zones or other geographic areas to which populations can be relocated. A hurricane of the scale of Irma and Maria devastates entire countries. We of the Caribbean are a proud and resilient people. The world must not stand by and allow the evils of climate change to force Caribbean people to become climate refugees. We must rebuild, and we require the community of nations to partner with us in this rebuilding effort. In the fight against the disastrous effects of climate change, allow me to commend the work of many international agencies and organizations, as well as non-governmental actors. My country is especially heartened by the work being undertaken by the Commonwealth and its leadership. It follows that if we are to achieve a sustainable planet, it requires an all- hands-on-deck approach. From the onset, there must be buy-in from all stakeholders. No one should be left out, and therefore this calls for inclusiveness, unity and appreciation of the input and contributions that all can make to achieving the world we want. This brings me to the first part of our theme â?? focusing on people. There can be no debate that our people are our primary resource. It is no marvel, therefore, that Governments allocate a large percentage of their budgets to developing their human capital and expend great effort to ensure that they meet the basic needs of their populace. Governments that fail to provide for their people and that ill-treat, abuse and oppress their people must be rightly ostracized by the international community. Our world comprises all kinds of people, but I wish to highlight the youth â?? a sector of all our populations on which the global community must increase its focus. I commend the United Nations on its unflinching efforts to draw attention to our youth. Indeed, it was more than two decades ago that the General Assembly adopted the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. Young people constitute 18 per cent of the global population. Young people and children together account for nearly 40 per cent of the worldâ??s population. Young people are not just our future; they are our present. Globally, Governments must do all they can to provide institutions and opportunities for learning and development, create employment and prepare young people for and steer them towards entrepreneurial endeavours. But Governments cannot do it alone. We therefore use this forum to call upon the business community, as well as non-governmental agencies and actors, to provide our young people with viable options and opportunities for gainful employment and social and economic advancement. We cannot speak of attaining the Sustainable Development Goals without a focus on our youth. A vital element of a sustainable planet is peace. It behoves us all, nations great and small, to work towards the achievement of that essential universal value. Regrettably, while in some countries citizens are forced to engage in a daily struggle for survival, braving the scorching sun and bitter cold to labour for less than $1 per day, other countries are expending billions of dollars on developing weapons of war and mass destruction. While some Governments are allocating large sums to secure a future for their women and young people, others are investing in tools of war. While the budgets alone of some Governments will be inadequate to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, others are using multiple times those budgets in developing nuclear warheads. In order to attain a sustainable planet, our priorities must be synchronized, harmonized and synergized. Our goal must be the preservation and conservation not only of our natural resources, but also of our human resources. My delegation condemns unreservedly the actions that have led to heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula and calls on all countries to respect and honour their solemn commitments under international law. We condemn all actions that encourage violence and disrupt peace. There can be no place in todayâ??s world for war and violence. We therefore join the international community in demanding diplomacy and dialogue instead of sabre-rattling and warmongering. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands proudly with our Caribbean and Latin American neighbours as a zone of peace and exhorts all members of the community of nations to expend every effort to create and promote peace. The theme of the current session makes a clarion call not only to strive for peace, but also to strive for a decent life for all. No boy, no girl, no man, no woman, no person should be left behind. We must work together to reduce poverty and hunger, promote justice and equality, and ensure that our people have access to health care and economic opportunity. In that global effort, we must be inclusive and each and every country must be allowed to play its part. No one nation can do it alone. Human suffering anywhere is human suffering everywhere. We must build partnerships and ensure the contribution of all the populations of our planet Earth. All must be allowed to sit at the table of brotherhood and contribute to finding lasting solutions to the problems that we face. In that regard, we call on the international community yet again to look at our dear friend, Taiwan â?? a modern country of 23 million people that has had tremendous successes in technology, agriculture, health, and renewable energy; a country that is a model of peace and security. Saint Kitts and Nevis has experienced first-hand the benefits of partnership with Taiwan. There is much that it can offer, and we lose collectively when we seek to isolate and prevent our fellow nations from having a seat at the international table. Saint Kitts and Nevis continues its unwavering support for the Government and the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to be included in the United Nations and other international agencies. There is much that we can learn from Taiwan, and we can no longer afford to ignore the voices of its 23 million people. In equal measure, we call yet again for the lifting of the more than 50-year embargo against our Caribbean sister Cuba. The Cuban people are a noble people who have demonstrated their resilience despite insurmountable odds. Their leadership in health and humanitarian assistance to Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America is well known. The Cuban people ask only to be given a fair chance to live their lives in dignity and peace. In closing, I acknowledge that the task ahead of navigating the many complex issues of the international community will not be easy. However, we remain firm believers in collective strength and collective effort. The journey to a sustainable planet and a future for all is attainable. Throughout history, we have achieved more together than we have ever achieved alone. Whether we are small islands; land-locked, mountainous, desert or ice-capped States; whether we are super- Powers or powerless, we are all better and the United Nations becomes a better Organization when we work together. Alone we can do little, but together we can achieve much. The challenges that we face globally â?? from climate change to refugees to war and violence â?? require urgent action now. The world does not have the luxury of time. We have talked. We have debated. We have postulated and hypothesized. We have studied and analysed. We must now act. In that regard, I can find no more elegant prose than that of American civil-rights leader, Martin Luther King, Jr., who said: â??We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.â??",1,196
7795,Session 72 - 2017,KOR_72_2017.txt,KOR_72_2017,72,2017,KOR,"First of all, on behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Korea, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the victims of the earthquake that hit Mexico on 19 September as well as to the people and the Government of Mexico. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all Member States and the staff of the Secretariat for their contributions to world peace and security. I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I expectt this session will yield many meaningful results under his excellent leadership. I also wish Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres great success. The Republic of Korea is a strong supporter of the goals of the United Nations aimed at preventing conflicts and sustaining peace. I look forward to its rebirth as an even stronger organization for fostering peace and prosperity for all peoples during his tenure as Secretary-General. As I prepared this address, I thought about the spirit of the United Nations and the joint mission we all share. The United Nations is perhaps one of the best institutional inventions created by human intelligence. It was born to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and has worked tirelessly to meet the challenges confronting humankind over the past 70 years. The role and contribution to the international community of the United Nations will continue to grow over time. Today the number of transnational issues continues to increase, and no country can resolve them single-handedly. For this reason, we should truly fulfil the spirit of the United Nations in finding solutions to all the problems facing us. To that end, I hope the world will look to the Republic of Korea, located on the southern part of the Korean peninsula at the eastern end of the Eurasian continent. I believe the candlelight rallies last winter in my country represented a historic moment that reflectedthe brilliant achievement of the spirit of the United Nations. Embodying the power of cooperation and solidarity in defiance of challenges, the rallies lit the way ahead towards a future for humankind. Some may remember the scenes of the candlelight rallies shown by the media. On streets sparkling with millions of lights, people expressed their opinions freely and joined in discussions on every street corner. There was singing, dancing and painting, the radiant faces of parents taking their children by the hand to join the rallies, and the pride of young people who picked up trash on the streets afterwards. All those scenes were very much a part of our democracy and peace. The candlelight revolution in Korea started in a public square where a yearning for the restoration of democracy and the Constitution awakened citizensâ?? collective intelligence. I myself participated in the rallies as an ordinary citizen. The people of the Republic of Korea achieved democracy in the most peaceful and beautiful manner. They proved the power of popular sovereignty, which is the quintessence of democracy. They also proved that the power of peace can bring greater changes to the world than violence can. The new Administration of the Republic of Korea was made possible by that candlelight revolution. Beyond its significance in making way for democratic elections, the Administration was established through the peopleâ??s participation and aspirations in the awareness that they are the rightful owners of the nation. I stand here now on behalf of that Administration. I am very thankful for, as well as proud, of the fact that the Republic of Korea, while it is a democracy that bloomed only recently, has shown the world new hope for that form of Government. Currently building on its new-found strength, the Republic of Korea intends to play an active role in addressing the issues facing the international community. The Republic of Korea has always walked in step with the United Nations. Since our Government was established, in 1948, we have received significant assistance from the United Nations, both during the Korean War and in the process of post-war reconstruction. Although we were not able to become a Member of the United Nations until 1991, we have enhanced our role and responsibilities as a State Member faster than any other in the span of only a single generation. Since 1993, Korea continues to participate in peacekeeping operations. As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission this year, it is focusing on resolving the root causes of conflicts. In the past five years, the Republic of Korea has increased its financial assistance for refugees 15- fold, and last year, it joined the $20-million-plus club under the aegis of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By expediting the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and making changes in its own energy policy, the Korean Government is also taking a lead role in supporting the climate-change responses of developing countries through the Global Green Growth Institute and the Green Climate Fund. Moreover, my Administration has reached the goal of filling 30 per cent of its Cabinet positions with female ministers, thereby spearheading efforts to realize gender equality, one of the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In the next few years, the Republic of Korea will significantly increase its contributions to the United Nations in every sector. It is truly meaningful that the theme of this session of the General Assembly â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is in line with the philosophy of governance of the new Administration in the Republic of Korea. â??People come firstâ?? is the slogan that I have used for several years to express my political philosophy, and the people are at the centre of every policy of my new Administration. As of now, my Administration is pursuing bold measures to change the economic paradigm so as to deal with inequalities that stand in the way of growth and social cohesion. We are currently pursuing economic policies focused on income growth for individuals and households, and promoting an economy in which growth is fuelled by job creation and everyone can enjoy equal opportunities and the products of growth. That is what we call a people-centred economy. My Administrationâ??s determined endeavours to realize inclusive growth will not be confined to our country. In accordance with that new paradigm, the Republic of Korea will offer its support for sustainable growth in developing countries. I was born in a refugee town in the middle of the Korean War. That civil war, which evolved into an international war, devastated countless lives. More than 3 million people died, and many of the survivors were deprived of a decent living. My father was one of them. My father, who believed that he was taking temporary refuge at that time, was never able to return to his hometown before he passed away. I come from one of the separated families â?? victims whose human rights were violated because of the war. The war has yet to come to a complete end. The Korean War, which began as an offshoot of the larger Cold War, continues to this day. Although the Cold War ended and it has been 64 years since the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement, the war continues in the form of an uneasy ceasefire on the peninsula â?? the last remnant of the Cold War order in North-East Asia. As tensions mount in North-East Asia because of the North Korean nuclear and missile issue, the memory of war and its wounds are becoming more acute, and hearts that long for peace are filled with pain. That describes the situation concerning the Republic of Korea on the Korean peninsula in September 2017. For me, the President of the only divided country in the world, achieving peace is a calling and a historic duty. I represent my fellow citizens, who have sent a message of peace through their candlelight revolution to the global village in which wars and conflicts know no end. At the same time, I have been entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding my peopleâ??s right to peace and to undisturbed daily life as universal values. For those reasons, I hope that North Korea will be able to choose its own path leading to peace. I believe that peace, when it is chosen willingly, naturally becomes sound and sustainable. More than anything, I am grateful that my convictions are shared by the international community. Despite the international communityâ??s concerted demands and warnings, and to our great disappointment and indignation, North Korea recently carried out its sixth nuclear test and additional missile-related provocations. In the wake of the nuclear test, the Korean Government has consequently convinced countries in and beyond the region of the need for stronger sanctions and pressure to make North Korea end them and choose the path of dialogue. I very much appreciate the Security Councilâ??s unanimous and unprecedentedly rapid adoption of resolution 2375 (2017), on North Korea sanctions, with measures tougher than in any previous resolution. That clearly reflects the fact that the international community is collectively outraged and is responding with one voice to address the North Korean nuclear issue and the problems on the Korean peninsula. Once again, as the representative of one of the parties directly involved with issues concerning the Korean peninsula, I would like to express my appreciation to the international community for its shared understanding and support for the position of the Korean Government. Despite North Koreaâ??s flagrant violation of its obligations and commitments under the Charter of the United Nations, the Korean Government and the international community are determined to make every possible effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue peacefully. The relevant Security Council sanctions on North Korea, in resolutions that articulate the principles of a peaceful, diplomatic and political settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue, are also part of those efforts. Once again, here in the General Assembly, where nations pledge to act to achieve world peace and the shared prosperity of all peoples, I will make the following points very clear to North Korea and the international community. We do not desire the collapse of North Korea. We will not seek reunification by absorption or artificial means. If North Korea makes the decision, even at this juncture, to stand on the right side of history, we are ready, alongside the international community, to assist. North Korea should acknowledge all these immutable facts as soon as possible. It must immediately cease making reckless decisions that could lead to its own isolation and downfall, and choose the path of dialogue. I urge North Korea to abandon its hostile policies against other countries and to give up its nuclear weapons programme in a verifiable and irreversible way. The efforts of the international community should also be strengthened. It must continue to respond strongly and sternly until North Korea gives up its nuclear programme of its own accord. All nations must thoroughly implement Security Council sanctions resolutions and seek new measures in the event of any further provocations by the North. It is also important to manage the situation calmly. All of our endeavours are aimed at preventing the outbreak of war and maintaining peace. In that respect, the situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue must be managed calmly so that tensions are not ratcheted up too far and accidental military clashes do not destroy the peace. We should all remind ourselves of the words of former United States President Ronald Reagan: â??Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful meansâ??. I would like to make a special request to the States Members of the United Nations and in particular to the Security Council. In order to fundamentally resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the basic spirit of a secure community enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations should be fulfilled on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. The pillars of security in North-East Asia and multilateralism should be wisely combined. The spirit of the United Nations is realizing global peace through multilateral dialogue. The Korean peninsula is where that spirit is most desperately needed. The realization of peace is what the United Nations was created for, what it aims for and what it is in the process of achieving. We need the United Nations to play a more active role on the Korean peninsula. The most important role the United Nations is being asked to play today is to come up with fundamental measures to end the vicious cycle of increased provocations and heightened sanctions. I have explained our new economic map for the Korean peninsula and new vision for the northern economy many times. I believe that genuine peace and prosperity in North-East Asia will begin when the foundation for a North-East Asian economic community is solidified on one side and multilateral security cooperation comes into being on the other. When the Olympic Games were reintroduced, in 1896, they had not been held for 1,500 years. The impetus behind their revival was the thirst for peace. The history of the modern Olympics started with the overwhelming emotion of the first Olympics, held in Athens on the Balkan peninsula, once a centre of conflict. Five months from now, the XXIII Olympic Winter Games will be held in PyeongChang, in the Republic of Korea, the first of a series to be held in North-East Asia â?? PyeongChang in 2018, Tokyo in 2020 and Beijing in 2022. I hope that these three Olympics will offer an opportunity for promoting peace and economic cooperation in North-East Asia, where the remnants of the Cold War and hope for the future, as well as confrontations and cooperation, coexist. The Republic of Korea is ready to make every possible effort to that end. I would ask members of the Assembly to imagine, for one moment, people who love peace and sports gathering from all around the world in PyeongChang, which is only 100 kilometres from the demilitarized zone, the symbol of division and confrontation on the Korean peninsula. Heads of State and Government from all corners of the world will exchange greetings of friendship and harmony. My heart fills with joy when I imagine North Korean athletes marching into the stadium during the opening ceremony, a South and North Korean joint cheering squad enthusiastically welcoming them alongside the brightly smiling faces of people from all over the world. It is not an impossible dream. I will work wholeheartedly to turn that into a reality, in cooperation with the International Olympic Committee, up until the last minute, in order to welcome North Koreans to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. I hope that PyeongChang will become another candle to be lit. Like the candles the Korean people held out in the face of the crisis of democracy, I believe that PyeongChang will become a candle that sheds light on peace when peace is threatened. I hope that all Member States and the United Nations will light their candles. I hope they will put their hearts and minds together to go hand in hand with peace. Today, with that heartfelt pledge, I invite all Heads of State and Government from around the world to come to PyeongChang. The steps they take, together, will become a march for peace. I look forward to seeing them all in PyeongChang next year.",1,196
7796,Session 72 - 2017,KWT_72_2017.txt,KWT_72_2017,72,2017,KWT,"On behalf of the Government and the President of the State of Kuwait, allow me at the outset to extend our sincere congratulations to the President and his friendly country, the Republic of Slovakia, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to assure him of my countryâ??s support and of our desire to facilitate his work and fulfilment of his responsibilities. We are fully confident that his great experience in international affairs will contribute to the conduct of the sessionâ??s work. Furthermore, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding work of his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, during his capable and successful presidency of the previous session. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on the deserved trust that the international community has placed in him and his friendly country of Portugal with his appointment as the new Secretary-General. We would like to wish him success in serving the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in his efforts to strengthen peaceful coexistence among nations, maintain international peace and security and reinforce international cooperation in all fields, including the follow-up to and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets. In that connection, we would like to say that we value the vital and effective role played by his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, over the past 10 years, and the great achievements accomplished during his tenure, such as the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the adoption of the SDGs, among others. The State of Kuwait firmly believes in the vital and effective role played by the United Nations and its various bodies, agencies and programmes in addressing the increasing global challenges and risks. We welcome the proposals and plans put forward by the Secretary- General to restructure the Secretariat so as to make it more coherent, promote its effectiveness, and ensure the cohesion and coherence of its activities in maintaining international peace and security and the follow-up to and the implementation of the SDGs. We renew our call with regard to the need to reform the Security Council so as to reflect new international realities in a manner that can reinforce its credibility and legality and ensure a permanent Arab representation on the Council, commensurate with the number of Arab States and their contribution to supporting the various activities of the United Nations. We are concerned about the challenges and risks that have arisen in various regions of the world, such as the spread of violence, extremism and terrorism, as well as the risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of their use. We also deplore violations of human rights such as those of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. We call for all acts of oppression against them to end immediately. They must be granted the right to citizenship and a decent life. The State of Kuwait has a firm and principled position when it comes to condemning terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations. We support all international measures to combat terrorism and eliminate terrorist organizations. Kuwait also contributes significantly to the provision of logistical support to the international alliance against extremist groups. It is regrettable that for multiple reasons the Middle East region has the lionâ??s share of such extremist challenges in various forms. We therefore need concerted international efforts to deal with them, and we must concentrate on addressing their root causes so that the world can enjoy security and stability. Such challenges and risks threaten the very essence of international peace and security, with the majority of victims being innocent civilians. Our brother Republic of Iraq is facing significant security, political and economic challenges, the most prominent of which is combating terrorist organizations and extremist groups. In that respect, we congratulate the Government and the people of Iraq on the victories that its forces have achieved on the ground in battling the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and on their successful liberation of numerous areas previously under the control of ISIL. We hope that such victories continue until the remaining areas still under ISILâ??s control are entirely liberated. We hope that they can contribute to national reconciliation efforts among the various elements of the Iraqi people, leading to the restoration of peace and stability in Iraq and the maintenance of its unity, independence and territorial integrity, while creating an appropriate environment for launching the process of reconstruction and ensuring the return of refugees to their homes. In that context, and in response to the calls for humanitarian and development assistance, the State of Kuwait, in cooperation with Iraq and the international community, will host an international donors conference in the coming year to rebuild the areas devastated by ISIL. We renew our commitment to providing all possible forms of support to help Iraq fulfil its remaining obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions so as to regain its regional and international role and standing. This year marks 50 years since the occupation of Palestinian territories began in 1967. It is the only Arab cause that has been the subject of endless United Nations resolutions and international and regional initiatives only to see none of them implemented, owing to the intransigence of the occupying Power, Israel, and its explicit and blatant refusal to implement Security Council resolutions of international legitimacy. The most recent is resolution 2334 (2016), which stressed that the Israeli settlement activities are illegal and illegitimate and called for them to cease, as they undermine the prospects of reaching a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. The State of Kuwait stresses its condemnation of the Israeli violations that occurred recently at Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem in a new attempt to alter its historical status. We categorically reject all illegal Israeli policies, plans and practices aimed at Judaizing the Holy City, erasing its Arab identity, disrupting its demographic structure and isolating it from its Palestinian perimeter. Such violations represent a flagrant threat to international peace and security and run counter to the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. We therefore appeal to the international community and the Security Council to honour their responsibilities and continue pressuring Israel to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy, allowing the Palestinian people to gain their legitimate political rights and the recognition of their own independent State over their own territory, with East Jerusalem as its capital and based on the borders of 4 June 1967, in accordance with the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. It is deplorable that since the onset of the crisis in Syria, we have seen horrifying actions in that ongoing conflict, confirming that destruction is its main theme. Its economic, social and humanitarian impact has yet to be evaluated or calculated, but it will, unfortunately, contribute to the loss of an entire generation of our brothers in Syria. The death toll of the conflict has exceeded 400,000 and nearly 12 million Syrians are either displaced or refugees, in addition to the massive destruction of property and infrastructure that has occurred in the majority of Syriaâ??s provinces. We estimate my countryâ??s voluntary contributions at various conferences to be $1.6 billion, the bulk of which has been given to specialized United Nations agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations dealing with humanitarian affairs. Despite the political and humanitarian efforts aimed at curbing the conflict in Syria, the reality on the ground remains unchanged, making it clearer than ever that the conviction and position that we have advocated from the beginning â?? that the crisis cannot be resolved by military means â?? is correct. The pace of the political track is still slow. Since the issuance of the communiquÃ© of the Geneva Conference on Syria (A/66/865, annex), whose content has led to sharp differences over its interpretation, we have witnessed seven rounds of Syrian talks in Geneva among the various parties over a period of five years, without any significant progress. We must, therefore, intensify our efforts to bring together the parties to the conflict, so that they can hold direct talks aimed at finding a peaceful settlement in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). Such talks should lead to the creation of a political situation that is able to maintain the unity, independence and sovereignty of Syria and meet the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. We reaffirm our full commitment to the unity of Yemen and respect for its sovereignty and independence. We reject any interference in its internal affairs and stress our support and backing of constitutional legitimacy in Yemen. A political solution in Yemen should be based on the three agreed actions â?? in other words, the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and its Implementation Mechanism, the outcome of the national dialogue and the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015). The State of Kuwait has made significant efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in Yemen. Last year, over a period of three months, we hosted political consultations between the Yemeni parties under the auspices of the United Nations aimed at restoring stability in that brother country. In that regard, we reiterate our readiness to host our Yemeni brethren for the signing of a final accord reached among them. We renew our support for the efforts of the United Nations and the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Yemen aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement to that crisis, thereby ending the suffering of the Yemeni people, who are facing dire humanitarian and economic conditions. We believe that the optimal solution for addressing those humanitarian conditions requires the restoration of peace and stability in Yemen in a manner that would preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the regional level and within the framework of the efforts undertaken by Kuwait to consolidate the foundations of good neighbourly relations, we renew our call to the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious confidence-building measures and establish relations based on reciprocal cooperation, mutual respect, common interests and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We also call on it to renounce practices that jeopardize the security and stability of the region and contradict the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and to adhere to the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such measures would enable us to direct our efforts towards reconstruction and development, so that all the peoples of the region can enjoy security, peace and well-being. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development faces major challenges, thanks to erroneous behaviour on the part of human beings over the years and the impact of natural disasters and greenhouse-gas emissions â?? challenges that only increase our international responsibility. It is therefore incumbent on us to do our utmost to fully implement the 2030 Agenda. To that end, we must enhance the mechanisms of development partnerships in order to keep pace with the needs and requirements of sustainable development. By doing that, we will be able to fulfil our international commitments and show our solidarity at the global level. That would constitute a real start towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a view to eliminating every form of poverty. In the context of the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we must address the impact of climate change, as it represents one of the biggest impediments to achieving the SDGs, and we must do so by following the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility. The State of Kuwait is steadily forging ahead under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, as we work to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by mainstreaming its goals in Kuwaiti national development plans and programmes, with the participation of all sectors of civil society and all partners. My countryâ??s development plan, the New Kuwait 2035 strategy, contains seven basic pillars that aim to transform Kuwait into a leading regional financial, commercial, cultural and institutional hub. The State of Kuwait has consistently shouldered its regional and international responsibilities with a view to achieving development in its various economic, social and environmental dimensions. We have come a long way along the path of implementing the noble initiatives of His Highness the Amir aimed at advancing international partnerships and reinforcing Kuwaitâ??s previous humanitarian and development efforts. Before I conclude my statement, I would like to express the gratitude of the Government and the people of the State of Kuwait for the trust that those present placed in my country during the elections held in June by electing it as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. Almost 40 years after Kuwaitâ??s first non-permanent membership in the Security Council from 1978 to 1979, we return today to renew our commitment to strengthening the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, the prevention of conflicts and the support of mediation efforts and endeavours for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. We are also committed to supporting efforts to make the Council more transparent and promote the participation of small States in the work of the United Nations and its bodies. We will strive to support and activate the international response to the refugee and immigrant crises and all other humanitarian crises resulting from wars and conflicts, which have intensified in recent years, while hoping that peace and security prevail all over the world.",1,196
7797,Session 72 - 2017,LAO_72_2017.txt,LAO_72_2017,72,2017,LAO,"At the outset, on behalf of the delegation of the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic, I would like to extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I am confident that with his extensive diplomatic experience, he will guide the session with great success. We stand ready to extend our full support and cooperation to him in the discharge of his noble duty. Likewise, let me extend my profound congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for the successful completion of his tenure as the President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. Once again, let me take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as the Secretary-General and for his initiative on the management reform of the United Nations, so that the Organization can respond effectively to the current global challenges. I hope that such efforts will contribute to the attainment of the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. May I join other representatives in extending our deep sympathy to the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean that have been severely affected by recent natural disasters. Today, the current global geopolitical landscape is fraught with myriad challenges that pose major threats to peace and security and hamper the development of countries and regions of the world. Therefore our concerted efforts are required to overcome those obstacles and challenges so that people in different countries and regions of the world can live their lives in durable peace and prosperity. That is why the theme chosen for the seventy-second session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is apt, as the international community is focusing on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has promised to leave no one behind. It is my firm belief that peace and security remain the common aspiration of the international community. Therefore, in order to maintain and promote peace and development, it is incumbent upon us to enhance collaboration so that peace and sustainable development can prevail in our world. The United Nations, which is the only universal Organization with mandates to maintain and promote peace and cooperation for development, has to be at the forefront. To realize those objectives, the United Nations needs to be reformed in such a way that it can respond to the current needs and pressing challenges of today. The Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic earnestly hopes to see a world without nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. In that context, we welcome the recent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which we also signed two days ago. However, we are well aware that we still have an uphill task ahead of us for the Treaty to enter into force and be effectively implemented. Therefore, the international community has to redouble its efforts in that respect. Throughout the past decades, we have seen that many countries in the world have experienced sustained economic growth and rapid development, which have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. That is thanks to peace and security, which have been essential prerequisites for the social and economic advancement of nations. At the same time, the improvement of peopleâ??s well-being will have a positive impact on political stability and social order and will help to reduce conflicts. Past experience shows that settling disputes by peaceful means and through diplomatic solutions is the best way to do so, as it is more durable and causes no loss of lives or property. Thus, it is important for the international community to further build mutual trust and flexibility and to jointly address the root causes of problems. In that spirit, the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic calls on all parties involved in disputes or conflicts in various regions of the world to exercise the utmost restraint and resolve such conflicts through diplomatic and peaceful means so as to de-escalate tensions. as we firmly believe that only a peaceful environment can form a foundation for advancing national social and economic development. The Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba and earnestly hopes that such relations will be enhanced, leading to the lifting of the embargo in the near future. That would bring about real benefits to the peoples of the two countries, as well as to the region and the world at large. Likewise, the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic also hopes that the Palestinian issue, which has lasted for many decades, will be resolved through peaceful means, with a view to creating two independent States of Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace, security and within internationally recognized borders, as stipulated in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. This year, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) turns 50. Over the past five decades, ASEAN has gone through a number of challenges and has adjusted itself to the changing regional and international environment, while taking into account its diversity and the particularities in the region. It has achieved progress gradually, which led to the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of 2015. The most remarkable achievement of ASEAN is its maintenance of peace, security and stability in the region, thus creating favourable conditions for ASEAN member States for the pursuit of their socioeconomic development and regional economic integration. At the same time, ASEAN has strengthened its relations with external parties, especially its dialogue partners in a substantive and comprehensive manner, based on mutual benefit. Importantly, ASEAN centrality has been recognized by all external partners under ASEAN- initiated mechanisms. Countries in the region and beyond are keen to forge cooperation with ASEAN, as it provides a venue for them to participate in discussions on many important regional and international issues of common interest and concern, thereby promoting mutual understanding and trust among participants, as well as peace, stability and development in the region and the world. ASEANâ??s achievements have been possible thanks to the ASEAN Way, which is an important factor, especially the principles of consultation and consensus and moving at a pace comfortable to all. The ASEAN Way signifies ASEAN centrality and unity. The ASEAN Way remains relevant, and ASEAN will continue to uphold its principles in the years to come. The Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Since its adoption, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been streamlined into our national socioeconomic development plan for 2016-2020, and a national steering committee for the implementation of the SDGs, which is chaired by our Prime Minister, has been formally established. At the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held in July, the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic registered to submit and present our Voluntary National Review in 2018. All this has demonstrated our Governmentâ??s firm political will and unwavering commitment to implementing and achieving the SDGs, as well as to building a strong foundation to support our countryâ??s aspirations to graduate from the status of least developing country by 2020. In pursuit of fostering an enabling environment conducive to achieving sustainable development, the Lao Government has undertaken an important initiative in adopting our national SDG 18, entitled â??Lives Safe from UXOâ??, which was officially launched by our Prime Minister and former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2016 on the sidelines of the eighth ASEAN- United Nations summit in Vientiane. SDG 18 aims to address specific development challenges caused by unexploded ordnance and mitigate its impacts on the lives of our people, which will pave the way for improving the livelihood and well-being of the rural population and enabling them to contribute to the implementation of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. As both a least developed country (LDC) and a landlocked country, the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic encounters various challenges that hinder our socioeconomic development and the achievement of our agreed global development goals. Against that backdrop, the country has pursued its development through the implementation of our eighth five-year national socioeconomic development plan. The Strategy 2025 and the Vision 2030 are aimed at graduating from LDC status and becoming a high-middle-income country by 2030. Towards that end, the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic pursues a policy of transforming itself from a landlocked country into a land-linked hub, facilitating direct connectivity between immediate neighbouring countries such as Viet Nam, Thailand and China, and the wider region. We hope to constitute a part of the production and supply chains through the implementation of infrastructure projects; the improvement of logistics and transport networks, such as the construction of a high-speed railway from Vientiane to Kunming, in southern China; and the improvement of the north-south economic corridor and the east-west economic corridor, among others. Those national strategies are being implemented as part of international and regional initiatives under way, including the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, the ASEAN Master Plan 2025 and Chinaâ??s One Belt and Road Initiative, of which the Lao Peopleâ??s Democratic Republic is a partner. I am of the view that political will is a fundamental principle for attaining all agreed development goals. Without firm political commitment, we will not be able to turn the Agenda for Sustainable Development into concrete actions and outcomes. Therefore, my delegation firmly believes that development remains an integral part of and a top priority for ensuring international peace, security and human rights, all of which are closely linked. Against that backdrop, we call on the international community to increase concerted efforts to ensure that development brings equal benefits for all countries. The Lao Government once again reaffirms its strong commitment and determination to work more closely with the international community in order to realize the 2030 Agenda and achieve our national development objectives of eradicating poverty, laying a solid foundation for graduation from LDC status, turning the country into an industrialized and modern nation and moving towards the direction of green and sustainable development that benefits all the people, thereby ensuring that no one in the country is left behind.",1,196
7798,Session 72 - 2017,LBN_72_2017.txt,LBN_72_2017,72,2017,LBN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I wish him every success in his endeavours. I also thank His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for wisely guiding the work of the previous session, and I commend Secretary-General Guterres for his efforts in revitalizing the role of the United Nations. Today we are in New York in September. We should think back 16 years ago and remember when terrorism struck this city, claiming the lives of thousands of victims. From this very rostrum, we renew our solidarity with the families of those victims and the families of all victims of terrorism all over the world. That tragic event ignited an international war against terrorism. That war has spread and has lost its purpose. Its raging fire has spread to other countries, especially in the Middle East. Many countries have felt that raging fire â?? some directly, while others have borne the burden of the results. It has fed the most heinous forms of terrorism, terrorism that seeks to eliminate humankind, civilization and culture. It has perpetrated the most heinous crimes against our people. It has spared no civilians, no children, no women, no old people. It has spared no cultural or religious landmark. It has also mushroomed and struck five continents, its means growing bloodier by the minute. Its crimes have violated all laws, conventions and international norms. No one knows where this terrorism will reach and how and when it will end. As the war began in Syria, the situation in Lebanon became destabilized. It was clear that, as an Arab country, it was supposed to be drawn into the circle of terrorism. However, Lebanon was able to prevent that horror, by preserving its unity despite its severe political divisions. No one crossed the red line facing every civilian, and that preserved the unity and security of Lebanon, despite the fact that some terrorists managed to infiltrate our towns and cities and organize armed cells there. With all of its forces, Lebanon was gradually able to eliminate those terrorist cells. Recently, our army emerged victorious against the terrorist organizations of Daâ??esh and Jabhat Fath Al-Sham and their armies, and ended their military presence in Lebanon. The burden that the ongoing war in Syria has caused Lebanon greatly exceeds our capacities. However, the Lebanese people have proved that they are humane and responsible. They have welcomed refugees into their homes, schools and hospitals. They have shared their food and their labour market with them throughout the years of conflict to this very day, thereby drastically increasing the countryâ??s unemployment rate. I would like to point out that more than half of our public schools operate in double shift, morning and afternoon, in order to accommodate and educate Syrian children. Lebanon is a small, densely populated country with limited resources. Its economy has been affected by several crises â?? first,the global economic crisis, and then the regional wars that have surrounded our country and prevented it from turning to the East and the Arab States that constitute our vital support. Waves of displaced people and refugees have been unleashed, increasing the countryâ??s population by a total of 50 per cent, which means that for every two Lebanese citizens there is one displaced person or refugee. Our population density has increased from 400 to 600 people per square kilometre, resulting in severe overcrowding spread over a total of 10,452 square kilometres. That has adversely affected our economy and led to an increase in the rates of various categories of crime. More dangerous is the fact that terrorist groups have taken shelter in refugee gathering areas and camps, making them fertile terrain for carrying out terrorist activities and claiming the lives of innocent people. We therefore need to regulate the return of displaced persons to their homeland. That need has become urgent as the situation in most of their original residences has settled. There are those who talk of voluntary return, while we speak of safe return. There is a difference, and the meetings of the International Syria Support Group have affirmed that difference. Return is either voluntary or safe, depending on the reasons for displacement. In the case of individual or political asylum due to a threat to the safety and security of the individual, the return should be voluntary. That is the case with political refugees, who should themselves decide the timing of their return, which must be coupled with the acceptance of the host country. As for the current form of collective asylum in Lebanon, it has arisen for economic and security reasons, as an escape from the dangers of war. We therefore call it displacement rather than asylum. It is not coupled with the acceptance of the host country and is not limited to individual asylum; it is, rather, a form of population invasion. As for the claim that such people will not be safe if they return to their country, we are all aware that it is a pretext and that it is unacceptable. On the one hand, around 85 per cent of Syrian territory has been recovered by the Government. On the other, if the Syrian Government is reconciling with the armed groups that it is fighting and granting them the freedom to choose between remaining in their villages or moving to other regions, what will the Government do with displaced persons who have fled the war? Recent events in Lebanon have confirmed that issue. On top of this, the displaced are living in misery in an unhealthy environment, despite all the services provided by the international and Lebanese institutions. It is painful for us to be unable to improve their situation, given their great numbers and our limited capacities. There is no doubt that it would be better if the United Nations assisted them in returning to their homeland rather than helping them to remain in camps that lack basic decent living standards. In addition to the Syrian exodus and the impending financial collapse of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Lebanon is burdened by the 500,000 Palestinian refugees who have been displaced from their homeland for 69 years and are still waiting to return to Palestine. We see no serious effort on the part of the United Nations in general, and the Security Council in particular, to implement a two-State solution. On the contrary, the international community, with all of its institutions, is unable to compel Israel to stop building new settlements. The violence continues unabated because people whose identity and land have been stolen cannot be subjugated. Israelâ??s approach to the solution has always been based on military force and violation of othersâ?? rights. Lebanon is a case in point. Israel has repeatedly violated both Lebanese sovereignty and resolution 1701 (2006). Some days ago, the Israeli air force bombed Syrian territory from Lebanese air space. A few days later, it carried out an imaginary raid, breaking the sound barrier above SaÃ¯da and causing material damage. Moreover, from time to time Israel installs spying devices in Lebanese territory. Those violations are not new. Israel has been doing such things for seven decades now. Records show that there are at least 100 land, sea and air violations of Lebanese sovereignty each and every month. Lebanon has lodged complaints with the Security Council, but so far has been unable to stop those violations. These seven decades of war with Israel have shown that cannons, tanks and planes do not achieve solutions or peace. There can be no peace without rights and there can be no justice without respect for rights. It is clear that the crime of expelling Palestinians from their land and displacing them cannot be rectified by committing the additional crime of compelling Lebanon to impose naturalization on Palestinians and denying them the right of return. The weakening of UNRWAâ??s role is a step towards that goal, seeking to end their refugee status in preparation for their resettlement. Lebanon will not allow that to happen. We will refuse to take in those refugees and displaced persons, whatever happens. The choice is ours and ours alone to make. All these wars have left deep wounds in our society and citizens. They have destroyed civil attitudes and the principles of coexistence, solidarity, tolerance and acceptance among individuals and groups worldwide. Our region has become trapped in a cycle of poverty and is becoming a hotbed of extremism, thereby creating continually deteriorating crises. Any solution must therefore be coupled with economic and social measures that can boost growth, improve social conditions and ensure a decent and stable life for the people of the region. I therefore call on Members to seriously consider establishing a common market to ensure that we do not live outside the shadow of freedom. Lebanon is itself a model of diversity. Its people, cultures and civilizations have always been diverse. They are the result of an amalgamation born in ancient times â?? from Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ, to Arabic, the language of the prophet, in addition to Phoenician, Roman, Greek, Latin, Persian and Coptic. We must not forget that the Lebanese people have long brought Muslims and Christians of different sects together. Despite a history of war and its repercussions, we have enjoyed peace and its positive aspects. Given our experience in coexistence and our comprehensive culture, Lebanon can be an oasis where the world can meet and engage in dialogue. After the end of the First World War, the League of Nations was established to maintain world peace. However, it failed and the Second World War broke out only two decades later. At the end of that war, the United Nations was established with the main objective of peacefully resolving disputes among countries and preventing future wars. But has it been successful in achieving that goal? The answer to that question is not difficult. The explosive world around us is the answer. World War Three has assumed a new form. It is no longer a war among nations, but rather a devastating internal war. Many countries have exploded for religious and ethnic reasons related to extremism and the rejection of othersâ?? rights to exist. As for the division of States into sectarian and ethnic groups, it is definitely not the solution and will never prevent wars. On the contrary, that approach can serve only to increase fanaticism, extremism and conflict. The solution will come only through intellectual and cultural change. Hence the urgent need for an institution dedicated to providing peace education. That has become crucial, since only a new culture of peace and forgiveness that teaches the principles of living together â?? also known as coexistence, in which people respect freedom of conscience and the right to hold differing opinions â?? can confront terrorism and create societies capable of establishing peace among people and nations; a culture that brings people together and contributes to strengthening relations among different societies; a culture that assists in adopting the language of dialogue as a means of conflict resolution. The role and mission of Lebanon is to wage war against the ideology of terrorism. Lebanon, in its pluralistic society, is the antithesis of the unilateralism represented by Daâ??esh and its peers. That is the basic effort that the United Nations must undertake â?? to intellectually fight terrorism, which has no geographic borders. It is an intellectual infection, transmitted electronically around the world. For all of those reasons, I propose Lebanonâ??s candidacy as a permanent centre, independent of the United Nations, for dialogue among different civilizations, religions and races. We hope that Member States will support Lebanon when that proposal is submitted so that we can work together to secure the aspirations of the United Nations as an institution and as nations seeking peace and a decent life for all people in a world of security and stability.",1,196
7799,Session 72 - 2017,LBR_72_2017.txt,LBR_72_2017,72,2017,LBR,"The seventy-second regular session of the General Assembly is being convened at a time of historic transition in Liberia and during a period of acute challenges to the global order. Today we face the threat of climate change, the violence of terrorism, the risks and indignaty of migration and a nuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, there is a race against time to accommodate a restless, youthful population in search of opportunity and a brighter future. I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his election. His progressive and creative leadership assures us of his commitment and his action to reform the United Nations for increased efficiency, better coordination and gender parity by 2021 at the senior leadership level. My delegation is also pleased with the initial steps taken towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. His vast experience and strong diplomatic skills assure us that he will steer the affairs of this session in an effective manner. The Liberian delegation offers him its full cooperation and support. I would also like to recognize Mr. Peter Thompson of Fiji for his stewardship over the past year, which saw the launch of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the successful conduct of the first Ocean Conference. Our theme this year is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, which aptly captures a universal aspiration. I hope that, at the conclusion of our deliberations, we will forge a consensus and renew our commitment as leaders to transform the lives of our peoples and meet our responsibilities to our planet. The work of the United Nations has never been more important to the search for peace and sustenance for global stability than it is today. By its Charter and its purposes, the United Nations continues to represent the genius of our collective ability to live together in peace and harmony. It still offers great hope to a troubled world. Liberians bear witness to this truth and remain grateful to the United Nations, and all of its organs and agencies, for the critical security interventions and continued support for Liberiaâ??s recovery and democratic aspirations. Eleven years ago, in September 2006, I stood before the Assembly (see A/61/PV.11) as the newly elected President of the Republic of Liberia and the first woman to be democratically elected as a Head of State on the African continent. When I speak to women in Africa and across the world, I am humbled by the inspiration drawn from my experience. The next generation must belong to women. Today I address the Assembly for the last time as I bring my two terms of elected office to a close. Liberia is just 22 days away from historic legislative and presidential elections. It will mark the first time in 73 years that political power will be handed over peacefully and democratically from one elected leader to another. That will pave the way for the next generation of Liberians to lead the country into the future. The election will signal the irreversible course that Liberia has embarked upon to consolidate its young, post-conflict democracy. Democracy is on the march in Liberia and, I believe, on an irreversible path forward on the African continent. I thank all our partners who have made meaningful contributions â?? financial and in kind â?? to ensure peaceful elections, and those organizations that will deploy observer missions to attest to the integrity of the election process. I assumed office after 25 years of development reversal, which was further compounded by a 15-year civil war. We have made great progress and laid the foundation for the next democratic Government. We have reshaped the armed forces of Liberia and the Liberia national police and have professionalized our customs and immigration services and the small Liberian coast guard. We are proud to report that, since the formal turnover of security responsibilities to our Government, Liberia has remained stable, peaceful and secure. We transformed the economy from a growth rate of less than zero to more than 8.7 per cent in 2013, until the health crisis and plummeting commodity prices brought a downturn to our economic recovery. Liberia has adjusted. We are resilient, and we embrace diversification. Our focus today is on strengthening the agriculture sector for value-addition and infrastructure development, with emphasis on roads and energy industrialization. Previously dysfunctional public institutions now have the capacity to respond to the needs of our citizens through decentralized county service centres, with ownership by strong local Governments. And from the tragedy of the health crisis, we are strengthening our health-care systems, prioritizing prevention and delivering capacity at the community level. The impact is being felt. Life expectancy progressed from a low 47 years to a hopeful 62 years, with a reduction in maternal deaths from 1,400 to 1,100 â?? an annual rate of reduction of 3.4 per cent. The poverty rate has decreased from 63.8 per cent in 2007 to 50.9 per cent in 2016. Infrastructure has been repaired and restored, and we continue to rehabilitate damaged roads and construct new ones. Cities and towns are bustling with new life, thanks to the increasing provision of electricity, potable water and technology. It is now possible to receive voice and data on phones and mobile devices from virtually everywhere in the country, at competitively low prices. Liberia has enjoyed the benefit of multilateralism through the full support provided by the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). From being a pariah State, Liberia has gradually regained the confidence of nations and has even risen to assume leadership roles in regional bodies â?? specifically of ECOWAS and the Mano River Union. I was personally privileged to play a role in the formulation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as co-Chair of former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonâ??s High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda and to help frame the African common position as Chair of the African Union high- level committee. There is so much more to share about Liberiaâ??s post-conflict transformation â?? how we have empowered ordinary citizens and a shared sense of citizenship, giving women, including market and rural women, a voice and the right to be heard. We have continued to transform the health-care and education systems, engender the entrepreneurial spirit in our youth, our vibrant media and our civil society. We are establishing cross-border development corridors to enhance regional trade, and we are strengthening the rule of law to tackle systemic undermining of integrity. Liberia is experiencing the birth of a post-conflict artistic community in song, hip-hop, painting, poetry, storytelling and fashion. Liberia has come a long way. We could not have accomplished all of that without the Organization â?? its political leadership, the generosity of its economic development support, humanitarian contributions and, most important, the stabilization and security provided to our country through the United Nations Mission in Liberia. I applaud you, Mr. President, and your predecessors, the Member States and United Nations civil servants around the world who have sacrificed in order for us to see the very first generation of school-age children growing up in an environment of peace, free of the violence of civil conflict. Liberiaâ??s transformation was powered by a world community that made a shared commitment to deliver peace to a country and a subregion beset by civil conflict and cross-border destabilization. The United Nations and its partner nations were of one mind, and from that global unity a new democratic Liberian State was born. Liberia is a post-conflict success story. It is the Organizationâ??s post-conflict success story. As I bid farewell to the Assembly today, and to my fellow Heads of State, I have a few parting thoughts. First, remember Liberia, which is making vibrant efforts to apply the tenets of democracy. Consider the lives saved, the wealth created, the stability assured because this global body led at a time of great uncertainty in our subregion and around the world. I ask the States Members of the United Nations to continue to lead, to spread the values of democracy, human rights and good governance, while strengthening solidarity for economic transformation and social resilience. It is often in times of transition that great leaders emerge and institutions are strengthened. Secondly, I recall that two years ago, at its seventieth session, the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 Goals that encapsulate the aspirations of Member States to eradicate poverty and reduce, if not eliminate, inequalities within and between countries. Our commitment to achieving the Goals must be unwavering, because progress in that area is inextricably linked to ending conflict and sustaining peace. Thirdly, real progress remains elusive in the lingering effort to reform the Security Council and make it more responsive to current global realities. The call for that reform must be pursued more robustly towards an early conclusion. Africaâ??s views are well articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. Today African nations are participating in strong regional and subregional bodies, which are evolving â?? adopting measures to secure and preserve peace and security, while strengthening economic integration. The United Nations, as the pre-eminent world body, must also continue to evolve to more effectively serve the common interests of all Member States. It must continue to chart the way forward. In its capable hands rest the hope and aspirations for a more just, peaceful and humane world, for the sake of our people and our planet.",1,196
7800,Session 72 - 2017,LBY_72_2017.txt,LBY_72_2017,72,2017,LBY,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy- second session, and to wish you every success in your work. I commend your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for all his efforts and wish him every success in his future endeavours. I would also like to note the ongoing wise efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to implement the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the areas of peace, security and human rights. The members of the General Assembly are aware of the challenges that my people are facing in these very trying times, starting with the revolution of February 2011 and its consequences, which have been a war and the negative involvement of a number of States. We have striven to mitigate and reduce our peopleâ??s suffering and to achieve real success. However, a great many problems remain and will not be resolved without the joint efforts of my country and of friendly States and the United Nations to enable us to establish the rule of law and democracy in Libya. I would like to commend the efforts of all those who have worked to find a political settlement to the crisis and to thank a number of States and regional and international organizations â?? including the League of Arab States, the African Union, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations â?? for helping us to restore stability in my country. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the new Special Envoy, Mr. Ghassan SalamÃ©, and to wish him every possible success in proposing rapid solutions to the current crisis. The Libyan Political Agreement reached following two years of negotiations remains the cornerstone for our efforts to address various problems and build the institutions of State. We are undergoing a transition that will ensure that we can coexist, leave the past behind us and stabilize our country, and the Presidency Council of the Government of National Accord is the fruit of all this work. It is essential to implementing and carrying out national reconciliation with the participation of all, without exception. Since the outset we have been determined to confront our crises, despite the difficulties they pose, with wisdom, patience and foresight, and we have been able to resolve a number of problems. We have put an end to the violence in Tripoli and other Libyan cities, where law enforcement and security agencies have started to discharge their mission. A number of embassies have returned, as will the United Nations Support Mission in Libya in the near future. Certain displaced individuals have returned to their home cities, although that has not been possible for others, owing to the lack of services, undermined by the military clashes. We continue to work to restore peace and security and rid ourselves of those trying to spoil things. In the economic field, we are now producing 1 million barrels of oil a day, up from 150,000 in March 2016. We must also mitigate the suffering that many have been experiencing during this development period, and we hope that with the restoration of security, the provision of the necessary financial resources and the resumption of activity by foreign firms we will be able to rebuild our State. We have demanded that the embargo on frozen assets be lifted, because it is costing the Libyan State close to $1 billion a year, and we sincerely hope that this will happen, especially since current circumstances are improving. In the area of national reconciliation, we have held a number of meetings aimed at achieving unity and resolving our differences and divisions. The decision-making monopoly of the Presidency of the Council of Deputies has resulted in political stagnation, preventing the majority from implementing the Political Agreement. In July, we came up with a road map for extricating ourselves from this crisis, providing for a referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections next year and the establishment of a supreme national council for reconciliation, mandated to address such issues as compensation, amnesty and others during the transition period. This positive vision was reaffirmed at the Paris meeting, where a consensus was reached on our progress towards democracy and the peaceful settlement of our problems through elections rather than armed confrontation â?? needless to say with the exception of the war against terrorism, which must continue â?? and through the restoration of ourmilitary and executive institutions. With regard to the fight against terrorism, we were successful in our attempt to liberate the cities of Sirte and Benghazi, among others, from Daâ??esh. However, we continue to have problems in dealing with the consequences of their seizure by terrorist organizations. We pay tribute to the memory of the martyrs who have laid down their lives to liberate the cities of Libya, and reiterate the need for a strategic partnership with all friendly States, especially the United States of America, which we thank for its support in halting the acts of these terrorist organizations. We must all understand that the fight against terrorism is not over. There are new hotbeds of tension and terrorism. Terrorists who have fled Iraq and Syria have now come to our country. We ask to be allowed to rebuild our army so that it can confront them and protect our country. My country is experiencing other difficulties, including illegal migration. A number of migrants have entered Libyan territory and used it as a transit country on their way to Europe across the Mediterranean. Libya suffers from this problem just as other States do. It is a burden on our already very limited resources and has a number of adverse security and economic consequences. We also lack the necessary resources to tackle the armed smuggling networks plaguing our country. We thank all who have helped us to address with this problem, especially Italy, which has recently provided training assistance in a number of cities. We welcome the support provided by France, Italy and Germany, especially in monitoring our southern borders, where most illegal migrants cross. We do not possess the capacity to tackle this problem alone. Another issue related to the migrants and refugees in Libya is how to pay for the aid they need. The Government of National Accord is working to assist them as much as possible, and we welcome the help we have had from humanitarian organizations, especially in the form of shelters. We would like to return these refugees to their homes rather than grant them citizenship in our country. Libya participated with European States in the Paris summit at which an agreement emerged aimed at finding political solutions to restoring stability throughout Libya. It was also agreed that we need to be provided with the assistance necessary to fund development programmes in the migrantsâ?? countries of origin. My country views human rights as extremely important. Since the 2011 revolution we have adopted a number of laws promoting human rights, but as this is a transitional period we are still working to restore State authority throughout the country, and that has naturally had an impact on the security situation. The Presidency Council is applying the no-impunity principle in order to gradually enable the law-enforcement agencies to take up their necessary functions. We would like to benefit from United Nations technical expertise in the field of human rights, and we have therefore been inviting human rights special programmes to visit Libya since 2012, as was reiterated during the thirty- fourth session of the Human Rights Council in March. One of the crucial current issues for the United Nations is Security Council reform. In that regard, we welcomed the Councilâ??s adoption of resolution 2378 (2017) a couple of days ago. We hope that reform will help us in developing the role of our Organization by, for instance, granting a permanent seat on the Security Council to the African continent, in keeping with the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration on the reform of the United Nations. The situation in the Middle East remains an absolute priority. Despite the crises that we are experiencing, we have spared no effort to support the Palestinian people in their attempts to establish an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reiterate our support for the Arab Peace Initiative to settle the Palestinian issue, and we urge the worldâ??s major Powers to assume their responsibilities in that regard. We wish to see a peaceful solution to the crises in Syria and Yemen in order to protect them from division and collapse as a result of the destructive conflicts raging through their countries and to fulfil the aspirations of their peoples in a dignified way that respects human rights and the rule of law. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for holding a special meeting on Libya this morning that attracted a great deal of international interest and at which everyone present reaffirmed that the backdrop to any solution must be a political one. Assistance will be needed for the presidential and parliamentary elections next year. We ask the Secretary-General and the Special Representative for Libya, Mr. Ghassan SalamÃ©, to present us with a timeline and send a clear message to all who attempt to hinder the process that there can be no military solution and that negotiations with authorities parallel to the Government of National Accord must stop, as they are in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. I would like to reiterate our desire for all sectors of the Libyan population to be able to exercise their rights to national self-determination and live in a State that enjoys the rule of law.",1,196
7801,Session 72 - 2017,LCA_72_2017.txt,LCA_72_2017,72,2017,LCA,"Saint Lucia congratulates Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session and assures him of the full support and cooperation of our delegation during his tenure. We thank his predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his able stewardship of the Assembly during the past year. For small island States like my own in the Caribbean region, the promise of the United Nations is being tested today more than ever. The world is experiencing extraordinary changes at a breathtaking pace â?? changes that are reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and the very nature of peace and security. I arrived in New York earlier this week after a tour of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma on islands in the Caribbean, and for the entire week I have been engaged in discussions focused on the regionâ??s recovery efforts. I have also watched, from afar and with a heavy heart, further destruction to my region â?? with Hurricane Mariaâ??s crushing blow to the sister islands of Dominica and Puerto Rico, claiming many lives and saddling those islands with hundreds of millions â?? if not billions â?? in damage. I have also listened in dismay to the silence of many, and the weak acknowledgement by others, regarding the crisis in our region. It has awakened in me the fear that we may be on our own to chart a path forward for our region. While some continue to doubt and deny the assessments of science, it is impossible to avoid the facts of climate change. In less than a month Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Cuba, the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, the Dominican Republic, Saint Bart, Saint John, Saint Thomas, the Turks and Caicos, Sint Maarten, and Saint Martin have all fallen victim to the ravages of the hurricanes, which have left death and carnage in their wake. I can also add Florida and Texas. The impact has been without discrimination. Let us acknowledge the fact that small island developing States have repeatedly warned the international community that a failure to respond adequately to climate change would betray our children and condemn future generations to certain doom. I dare say that we do not have the luxury to be silent on that front anymore. We must act now. The effect of natural disasters does not have a diplomatic solution. What is needed is tangible action. The future is now, and the challenges are profound. What is fast becoming the new normal is the intensification of extreme weather events, which demands from us real solutions in real time. No longer can we depend on the old mechanisms with their dense bureaucracies that delay or limit a nationâ??s ability to safeguard its citizens during a crisis and slow the rebuilding effort. I remind all here that Saint Lucia, along with most of our sister States of the Caribbean Community, is anchored at the heart of hurricane alley, with our people on the front line, and all too often we are the first to endure the ravages of Mother Natureâ??s fury when the storms come off the Atlantic Ocean. Today, as we look to the world for leadership and partnership, we thank France, China and Germany for their continued leadership on climate-change issues. The Government and the people of Saint Lucia offer their most sincere condolences and whatever support that we can to those in need. The ties that bind our peoples run deep; the pain of one is the pain of all. We ask that the global community follow that ethos. We never forget that we are one global ecosystem that demands that we all be our brotherâ??s keeper. Our Nobel Laureate, Sir Derek Walcott, has spoken to the sense of responsibility to oneâ??s neighbour that is rooted in our cultural DNA and the imperative of helping, not out of a sense of duty but out of a sense of community. That was exemplified by Mr. Orlando Smith, the Premier of the British Virgin Islands, as Dominica faced the imminent threat of Hurricane Maria. Mr. Smith, whose own island had already been brutalized by Hurricane Irma, offered his unwavering support to the Prime Minister of Dominica, Mr. Skerrit. Even in our destitution, we in the Caribbean open our hearts and our means to those in need. I pause here to share our condolences to others in our hemisphere, notably Mexico, which has long been of support to us, but now faces a mounting death toll from the earthquakes that have struck that country. I stand here and ask that we revisit many of our lofty goals, as we see the lack of equity that is at the heart of all of our discussions and seek to address it. Multilateral discussions on development, resilience and the sustainable development of our countries should be grounded in what is equitable and just. We must acknowledge that the United Nations will never succeed when only a few prosper and many, whose number is growing, do not. How can we, when the progress we make is fragile and unequal? How can we, when we indulge our differences to the exclusion of the work we must do together? How can we, when inequity remains the driving force of our international system, propelling some forward and leaving far too many behind? How can we, as leaders, talk about sustainable development goals, when the people of our countries continue to struggle just to survive? Fundamentally, our global reality is an increasingly integrated one. No one is spared the perils of the convulsions in our world. Our economies, natural environment and people are all connected. We in this hemisphere are not impervious to the impact of the wars and the starvation that are taking place in the Middle East and Africa, the persecution that is taking place in Asia and the rise of nationalistic tendencies taking place in Europe. We are stacked in a global row of dominoes, where a disruptive event in one country begets similar or worse events in neighbouring countries. It spreads, impacting us all and testing our social, political and economic systems. We live in a world of imperfect choices â?? choices between clinging to the old systems that do not serve us any longer and rethinking new ways to secure a better future. We must not turn away from the hard choices. We must not fear change. Our challenges are real, serious and numerous. We, the United Nations, must get better at the policies that strike at the root of the problem and ground our 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in one word: equity. I must repeat a point stated earlier. In a time when inequity pervades every aspect of our international order, what hope do we have of successfully implementing the SDGs when the deck is stacked against many of our people? How do we ensure that all citizens have their most basic needs satisfied, such as food on their plate, when we struggle from crisis to crisis? We must agree that there should be a minimum standard of living for each and every one of our citizens. We must maintain basic standards that provide adequate health care, education, housing, security and economic opportunity for every citizen of our countries. Without establishing such standards, we cannot engage in any meaningful discussion or plan of action. That is what will stem the flow of migration. It will offer opportunities to be productive members of society. It will dull the urge that drives some to crime and others into the arms of groups that foment evil. Any overhaul of the United Nations system must be founded on the principle of equity. Without equity as a foundation, Sustainable Development Goals are dreams that go away when we open our eyes to the constant state of crisis confronting us. I take this moment to assure the Secretary-General of my countryâ??s support for the effort needed to reform the Organization in order to address the new era and its responsibilities. At the heart of any reform of such a nature, we, nations both large and small, must play our role in protecting the rights of individuals everywhere. In the face of mounting challenges, we must seek the courage and wisdom to act boldly and collectively and revise outmoded programmes that are so glaringly inadequate for the needs of our time. We have to harness new ideas and technologies and invest in the individuals and the generations who will build our future. We must see more in terms of outcomes and less in terms of bureaucracy. We must come here to make a difference and be able to return to our homes ready to deliver on the promises that we have made. The mobilization of the leadership of the world to come here will be all for naught if we do not deliver. We must come here to make a difference and not get carried away by name-calling. Rather, we must ground our discourse in mutual respect and a commitment to deliver to those we lead. We must understand and acknowledge that when times change, so must we. Our claims to fidelity to the words of the Charter of the United Nations mean nothing if we do not create new responses to old and new challenges. We must be a source of hope for the poor, the sick and the marginalized so that we can ensure peace and a decent life for all our citizens on a sustainable planet. That requires that we constantly advance the principles of the Charter. The commitments that we make to each other must be honoured, which will, in turn, strengthen our mutual trust. Within and beyond the Organization, we must look more honestly at how we categorize each other and how the development and donor community rank us. How can we call a country a middle-income country, based solely on its gross domestic product per capita, when we know that its location renders it vulnerable to natural disasters that have the capacity to bring it and its people to their knees? It is unconscionable to see our peers forced to beg and plead for goodwill and to have to depend on commercial loan rates to rebuild broken economies, all because the traditional system is so unyielding, archaic and sometimes heartless in its design. That model must change to one that affords small and developing nations the real opportunity to survive and thrive in an increasingly cold global environment. The model has to change in order to afford all of us the opportunity to build back the infrastructure that can secure our futures and those of our people and have it be stronger and more resilient. In closing, the people of my region are resilient. We are a people and a region committed to working together in order to rebuild stronger and better. In challenging times, we do not hesitate to commit our scarce resources to one another. We truly are our brothersâ?? keepers. We have also been very fortunate to receive support from friends near and far as we seek to make a better world for those who will follow us. In our case, friendships like those that we have with Taiwan, Cuba and Mexico, among others, allow us to envision a positive future. I ask that, while we may come from different places and with different priorities, we must never forget that we share a common future â?? a future that will be secure only if we meet the threats, challenges and opportunities that confront us together, with greater cooperation and understanding. Our generationâ??s task is to engage in a common effort towards a common purpose as we answer the call of our times. Let it be said by our childrenâ??s children that we were tested and that we did not fail, but rather that we delivered to future generations a better world. We have that obligation to our people and to our world.",1,196
7802,Session 72 - 2017,LIE_72_2017.txt,LIE_72_2017,72,2017,LIE,"Mr. President, it is good to see you presiding over this session of the General Assembly. We know that we are in very able hands, and I look forward to working closely with you. We also salute the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, for his leadership. I am confident that he will chart an intelligent course for us to make the changes we wish to see in the United Nations. Mr. President, you have proposed for this session the theme â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, which takes us back to the very beginning of the Charter of the United Nations, written on behalf of the peoples of the world. To this day, the United Nations symbolizes great hope around the globe â?? hope for peace, hope for justice and hope for a life of dignity and decency, which represent the basic ambition of every human being. Yet fulfilling these hopes remains elusive for millions, and for millions of others those hopes have been shattered. Intolerance and nationalism were the drivers of the Second World War, and the Organization was founded in response to them. It is a place where we seek solutions together, instead of pursuing nationalist agendas. Only by embracing this understanding will we be able to achieve the best results at the United Nations. The horrors of armed conflict â?? the tragedy of the Second World War in particular â?? led the founding nations to pledge to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We have make a collective commitment to removing threats to peace and to suppressing acts of aggression. But today we often manage and contain armed conflict rather than preventing it in the first place. We must do better. This year we have the opportunity to take a historic step forward. For the first time since the creation of the United Nations, we can give an international tribunal jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. The most serious forms of the illegal use of force will be punishable. The tribunal in charge â?? and the centrepiece of our common fight for accountability â?? will be the International Criminal Court (ICC). I appeal to those assembled here today to live up to the commitment we made when we signed onto the United Nations Charter. Let us enforce the prohibition of the illegal use of force by making it punishable in the highest court of criminal law we have. Next year, we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the ICC. With jurisdiction over the most serious violations of international law, the establishment of the Court was an enormous achievement, but, today, it still lacks universality. There remains therefore a significant impunity gap. A very large number of people in the world do not benefit from its legal protection. These people must not be left without hope. They too deserve real prospects for justice. The people of Syria, for example, have suffered unspeakable violence. The crimes committed against them have been atrocious. And the silence with which we met those atrocities for so long puts us all to shame. But finally, late last year, we came together to create a real possibility for justice â?? the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, the accountability mechanism established by the General Assembly in resolution 71/248. The Mechanism itself will not conduct criminal proceedings against perpetrators. But it could be critically important in the preparation of case files for prosecution in courts with jurisdiction. This is a decisive step forward. A key to the Mechanismâ??s success will be strong support from us, the States Members of the United Nations â?? politically, by insisting on the importance of justice as part of political solutions; financially, by providing sustainable funding; and substantively, by sharing information and evidence of crimes that are in our possession. Accountability for the worst crimes imaginable, whether committed in Syria or elsewhere, is essential. But the truth is that there is no remedy and no compensation for these crimes. Prevention is the only effective form of protection. We look in particular to the Security Council for leadership. I thank the 113 States that have joined us in supporting the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Together, we represent a strong majority of States expecting effective action from the Council aimed at ending and preventing such crimes. This pledge could not come at a better moment. The Secretary-General has made prevention a key priority in his agenda, and applying the Code of Conduct works best when there is productive interplay between him and the Security Council. Never before have the needs for humanitarian assistance been as great as they are today. And never before have we seen such a significant shortfall in our response. The so-called forgotten crises are those that may need our attention the most. Yet our collective attention span barely does justice to even the most visible of emergencies. Armed conflict remains a key driver of displacement, human suffering and instability. But there are numerous other factors that make people leave their homes. Today, unprecedented numbers of people are on the move across the globe. Across the backdrop of history, there have been various periods of mass migration and there is ample evidence that migration has been a positive and enriching factor for receiving societies. But mass movements of people and irregular migration in particular also tend to create anxiety and fear. Taking these reactions seriously is crucial to overcoming them. My son, Leonard, entered kindergarten last year. Two children in his group are refugees from Syria. As a mother, I reflected on how this might influence him and his development. What happened was that he quickly learned a few words in Arabic and he knows what a Syrian birthday cake tastes like. He also understands now that there are kids who spend every single night thinking that their house might be bombed. We place high hopes in the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration that we will adopt together next year. I echo the call of the Secretary- General: migration must be an option, not a necessity. Irregular migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Human trafficking and modern slavery are perhaps the greatest human rights scandal of our time. They are also a global phenomenon and they particularly thrive in circumstances that create high levels of vulnerability. As is the case so often, women and girls are disproportionately affected. Many decades ago, we agreed on the abolition of slavery in all its forms. The relevant legal norm requires universal application. And yet the reality is that there is a disturbing level of impunity for the commission of these acts. We must no longer accept this paradox. Human trafficking and modern slavery are not just crimes, they are also a profitable form of organized crime. We therefore see great potential here in applying the tools developed to combat other forms of organized crime. Following the money can lead us to the perpetrators of these crimes. In this regard, Liechtenstein is prepared to share the expertise it has acquired as a financial centre committed to international standards of transparency and accountability. The people whom we serve look to us to reduce risks and defuse tensions. Yet the world is spiralling towards a new arms race. We are facing increased risks of self-destruction, including the unspeakable horror of the use of nuclear weapons. Most of us remember the shocking pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 from our history books. The United Nations was built on the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and on the promise of â??never againâ??, but, owing to collective complacency, we have not delivered on that promise. This week we have changed course for the better with the signing of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Without any doubt, it will take time to see the Treatyâ??s effects on nuclear stockpiles. Nevertheless, setting a number of important legal benchmarks that will become binding norms is great progress. Nuclear weapons are prohibited and should be eliminated. Their use can never be justified. The suffering that they cause runs counter to fundamental principles of humanity, the basic tenets of international humanitarian law and the dictates of public conscience. On Wednesday, I signed the Treaty on behalf of Liechtenstein as one of 50 signatory States. Together we extend a hand to those who so far have chosen to stand apart. We need their commitment to succeed in finally ridding the world of nuclear weapons. I have had the privilege to address the General Assembly eight times. On each of those occasions, I have talked about a particular aspect of the work of the United Nations that is of special significance to me â?? full gender equality. The progress made in the past few decades has significantly slowed, both internationally and back home. That is a disturbing trend. Commitments have gone unfulfilled and strategies have turned out to be little more than empty promises. The achievements that nobody questioned 20 years ago are now under attack. The level of political participation has decreased, and the statistics on gender pay gaps are still shocking. Yet I remain not only committed but optimistic, simply because I strongly believe that many of our common goals will become achievable only if we indeed achieve gender equality. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the domestic and the international come together. If there is one area in which the United Nations must show the way, this is certainly it. The work of the United Nations can seem abstract. Explaining its relevance to our citizens at home and to our children can be a challenge. There are topics that make that task much easier, however; for example, climate change. Everyone understands what is at stake in that discussion. If we cannot live on our planet, no one will prosper, irrespective of nationality, gender or economic wealth. And no country, large or small, can tackle the problem on its own. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change does not end the threat of climate change, but it is our only realistic hope for addressing the issue together. I therefore experienced great satisfaction when I deposited Liechtensteinâ??s instrument of ratification earlier this week. Indeed, it is something I will be proud to share with my children.",1,196
7803,Session 72 - 2017,LKA_72_2017.txt,LKA_72_2017,72,2017,LKA,"I am very pleased to be able to congratulate the newly elected President of the General Assembly and to have the honour of addressing the Assembly at its seventy-second session, the third time I have done so as leader of Sri Lanka. The theme of this yearâ??s session is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Today, as we observe the various scenarios in play around the world, that slogan seems highly pertinent. In 2015, before my election as President of Sri Lanka, I made a number of pledges to the people of my country. At that juncture, Sri Lankaâ??s presidency had more executive power than the corresponding office in any other democratic system in the world. Since my election, the excessive executive powers of the presidency have been transferred to Parliament in accordance with my pledge. I believe that the concession and transfer by a leader of such power to another organ has set an example to my country and the world. Those of us who are leaders of democratic countries must safeguard democracy and use our power to work to build a just society. However, events of the past few decades â?? indeed, of world history generally â?? have shown that many leaders are reluctant to yield power, resulting in discord, the disruption of peace and sometimes disputes at the international level as well. For myself, I have established democracy in my country and taken action to eliminate political groups with autocratic tendencies. I want to bring to the Assemblyâ??s attention my efforts to ensure democracy, safeguard human rights and nurture my peopleâ??s fundamental rights during the past two and a half years. My Government declared 2017 a year for poverty alleviation, with a view to freeing our country from the clutches of poverty, a major effort that I believe the entire world is engaged in. In that regard, we have launched a number of development programmes to strengthen the domestic economy. We are all aware that for 30 years Sri Lanka suffered from a protracted conflict that crippled its economy. Terrorists advocating separatist ideologies wreaked havoc, but we were able to defeat them, establish democracy and begin to govern the country peacefully. But the economic legacy of the conflict was extremely detrimental to progress. We have learned the lessons of that conflict and are working to strengthen our domestic economy, promoting local industries and industrialization with a view to achieving economic development, while also fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals and making sustainable development a priority. My country, like the rest of the world, including the United States of America, is being affected by unprecedented climate and weather conditions. In that regard, I believe that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is crucial, and we should agree that ensuring its implementation is essential for humankind and the world. Along with our national programme for poverty alleviation, I have launched a new movement, Grama Shakthi, as part of our clear vision and plan for consolidating the countryâ??s economy. We want to strengthen the local economy, develop local agriculture, take the country in a new direction and continue the economic plan between now and 2025 with rigour, with a view to achieving major changes in our economy. As we know, children today are faced with many problems, not just in my country but all over the world. I have therefore launched a national programme in Sri Lanka to protect children. We have a mammoth task ahead of us in keeping our children safe from abuse and the drug manace. The protection of children is a matter of national and international importance, and implementing programmes to that end is therefore essential. There is also much discussion in the world about protecting womenâ??s rights. A great deal of attention has been focused on the subject, and we have seen how women have been mistreated in certain societies. Women make up more than 52 per cent of Sri Lankaâ??s population. We have worked to protect their rights by amending our Constitution to establish a mandatory 25 per cent quota for women candidates in local Government elections, one of several recently adopted amendments concerning major programmes, along with those protecting children and womenâ??s rights and preventing the threat posed by illegal drugs. We know that there is a need for an extensive global programme for preventing and controlling the threat posed by drugs. That issue has become a major challenge for every country and society, and I believe that all of humankind should join hands and come up with a joint programme to achieve that goal. When my Government came to power in 2015, we were facing two major problems, one of which was our foreign debt crisis. Large sums of money were needed to repay our loans. On top of that, the Human Rights Council was considering allegations of human rights violations and raising serious concerns with regard to the then Government. Since then, however, we have been working to strengthen our domestic economy and attract foreign investment, and through these programmes have been successfully paying down our loans. With regard to the resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council in connection with allegations of human rights violations, my Government is now dealing with the issue and making resolving those problems a priority. Consolidating democracy and protecting and nurturing human and fundamental rights constitute the pillars on which my Government has based its successful leadership of Sri Lanka and its efforts to establish a democratic society, and we will continue to strengthen those elements in the future. We have also worked to strengthen national reconciliation. Sri Lanka is home to people with different languages and different faiths, and we want to establish fellow feeling among the various groups and eliminate hatred, suspicion and mistrust, while building a society that is free of such problems. While we must work to strengthen our countryâ??s economy and thereby promote prosperity, we also want to build a country that is disciplined and has high moral standards. The rule of law is of major importance in that regard, and my Government has prioritized the task of establishing the rule of law and ensuring its application. I should therefore emphasize that, while we are strengthening democracy, at the same time we are working to promote our peopleâ??s human rights, nurture their basic rights and maintain friendly relations with other countries. Despite the divisions that have existed between Sri Lanka and some of its powerful allies, today we maintain good relations with those countries, and we very much appreciate the assistance of the United Nations in that regard. As a State Member of the United Nations for approximately 62 years, Sri Lanka has abided by its rules and regulations and complied with its conventions, treaties and agreements. As a country with such a track record of compliance as a Member of the United Nations, we want those good relations to continue. I want to ensure my countryâ??s independence and sovereignty in all that we do. In addressing the various allegations that have been made against us and dealing with the related problems, we have to move slowly and with enormous care. In that regard, certain extremist elements expect a fast pace. They want quick, short- term solutions, but our country is dealing with the legacy of a war that dragged on for 30 years and divided its people. We want to establish peace and unity, promote brotherhood among our people and eliminate hatred, suspicion and mistrust. If we are to achieve that, to build up a loving country and promote a prosperous economy, the assistance of Member States is of paramount importance. That is why I say that ours is a slow and steady pace, and in that connection, we call on Member States for their help. I believe that a rapid pace would be perilous at this juncture and the quick solution expected by certain extremist elements would be unlikely to solve our complex problems. I believe that everyone would agree with me in that regard. Preventing the recurrence of war and promoting a sense of brotherhood among the various groups in my country, while ensuring each groupâ??s right to speak its own language and worship according to its own faith, are among my Governmentâ??s goals. I respectfully appeal to the United Nations and to every nation to support us in realizing those goals. We want to promote economic prosperity, democracy and an end to war, and we want to consolidate our democracy and set an example to other nations. I am asking for assistance in achieving those goals. I would like to conclude by congratulating the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary- General, and may the noble Triple Gem bless us all.",1,196

His illustrious career as a diplomat gives us confidence that we will see a successful session, and I assure him of my delegationâ??s full support and cooperation during his tenure. Let me also commend his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his excellent leadership of the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. He handled that great responsibility very well and with much skill and devotion. During the previous session, we also witnessed the appointment of the new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, whose impeccable credentials and distinguished service within the United Nations, coupled with his wealth of knowledge and experience, leave us hopeful that he will handle the challenges of his new position with dexterity. We therefore congratulate him on his well-deserved appointment and wish him success in the long journey ahead. We also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for a job well done. He performed the duties of his high office with consummate diplomatic skill and honour. We meet once again for the seventy-second time in the history of the United Nations in order to appraise the worldâ??s political, security and economic situations. We do so at a critical juncture in human history. Now is the time for a true reflection on the role of the Organization in the twenty-first century, since it is on the United Nations that humankind places much faith and hope for a better life for all. The pall of despair that descended on the world following the Second World War was eased by our forebearsâ?? adoption of lofty ideals when they came together in San Francisco and resolved â??to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; â??to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and; â??to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedomâ??. Sadly, today we speak of a world that is slowly regressing to resembling the one that existed seven decades ago. The multifaceted and complex challenges that have besieged us are threatening to erode the laudable strides that the United Nations has made since its establishment. Inter- and intra-State conflict characterizes the modern-day world. From the global refugee crisis to the spread of terrorism, the ability of the United Nations to effectively resolve conflict is being put to the test. The heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, coupled with the flagrant violation there of Security Council resolutions and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, speak to the arms race brewing in that part of the world. As if that were not enough, respect for human rights and the rule of law â?? the principles that speak to the very fibre of the United Nations â?? continues to be flouted with impunity. Women and children in particular face the worst forms of brutal abuse, especially in conflict-ridden countries. Poverty also continues to be a dreadful affliction for developing countries, undermining their efforts to re-orient their economies towards significant gains in real growth. The result is that most poverty-stricken populations are sometimes left with no option but to employ unorthodox methods for economic survival to sustain their livelihoods. It is in that context that we welcome the theme for this session: â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. It resonates squarely with the principles that underpinned the establishment of the United Nations. That is what the Organization stands for. The complexities and dichotomies that characterize humankindâ??s existence on the planet and the inequalities that prevail between developed and underdeveloped countries would be a thing of the past if we could remain true to our mission and focus on people on our development path. While the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) embrace the concept of universal prosperity for all societies, we are all aware that, in essence, that ideal is still far from being realized. We must move forward cooperatively in our efforts to achieve peace and a decent life for all. It is incumbent on the entire international community to act in unison as we strive to restore peace and deploy a universal response to our goals. To that end, our immediate challenge is to come up with a new strategy that encapsulates the SDGs and multidimensionally integrates them into the concept, as the theme outlines. We are cognizant of the fact that in Lesotho our destiny is in our hands and that the chief responsibility for sustainable and equal development resides with us. As a newly inaugurated Administration, we have set for ourselves the very lofty goal of restructuring all our important Government institutions. In that regard, we intend to embark on an ambitious yet achievable reform programme. We are committed to fully implementing the decisions of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and putting Lesotho on a path of inclusive reform that will consist of constitutional, parliamentary, electoral, public-sector and security- sector reforms. It is an exercise that will involve all stakeholders, who must engage with genuine and total commitment to establishing a stable political order that is conducive to economic development. As the new Government of Lesotho, our resolve and commitment to implementing SADC decisions signifies our commitment to working together with our regional body in pursuit of lasting peace and security in our country and the whole SADC region. We have made good progress in the implementation of SADC decisions following the recommendations of Justice Mpaphi Phumaphi, which were laid out during his enquiry in Lesotho after the brutal assassination of Lieutenant General Mahao, Lesothoâ??s Army Commander, in June 2015. Today I have to once again report to the Assembly with sadness and great humiliation the assassination of the current Army Commander, Lieutenant General Khoantle Motsomotso, less than three weeks ago, on 5 September, by two senior army officers, who were in turn shot and killed by the Generalâ??s bodyguards. Despite such daunting challenges to our small mountain Kingdomâ??s political and security instability, SADC is standing firmly behind us as a regional bloc to help restore peace, political stability, security and the rule of law in Lesotho. On that note, I wantto thank SADC, our development partners, the Friends of Lesotho, the African Union and the United Nations for their unwavering support in ensuring that Lesothoâ??s democracy is protected in its pursuit of economic growth and stability. On the development front, I am happy to report that the Government of Lesotho is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline in order to stabilize the national economy and stimulate growth and business activity while preserving the environment. At the same time, we are relentlessly committed to combating crime and corruption at all levels of our society, in accordance with SDG 16, which recognizes that corruption undermines efforts to combat poverty and gender equality. It further acts as a tax on the poor when it comes to accessing their right to public services. We are aware that on our own, without the support of our cooperating partners, our efforts to root out corruption cannot yield the desired results; hence our urgent call to them to join forces with us in our crusade. As a least developed country, we believe that the concept of development is meaningful only when it gives communities tangible benefits in a sustainable manner. It is indisputable fact that young people are the thread that holds together the fabric of every nation and that at the same time they can be major agents of change. It would be a serious and unwise miscalculation not to recognize them as our partners of today and leaders of tomorrow. In that regard, we emphasize the importance of young peopleâ??s participation in decision-making at all levels. Job creation for young people also remains a priority. With reference to SDG 8, our global strategy for youth employment is set to be operationalized by 2020. Countries therefore have to develop strategies for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization. In that regard, the Government of Lesotho remains committed in its resolve to harness the energy of young Basotho men and women in order to further the advancement of the economy of our country. Lesotho continues to deal with the scourge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is more prevalent among young women, who are the backbone of our economy. The empowerment of women is a focus of our development policy. We believe that elevating them to positions of leadership in both the private and public sectors will lead to a more equitable and prosperous society in Lesotho. We recognize that poverty and the AIDS pandemic go hand in hand, and our poverty eradication policies therefore target the most vulnerable groups, including the elderly, AIDS orphans, women and young people. We remain committed to ensuring that those objectives are tackled, for they are key components of the SDGs. On the economic front, like other landlocked developing countries, Lesotho continues to face challenges inherently linked to its unique geographic position. The burden of high transport costs and cumbersome and slow export processing procedures continues to impose serious impediments to our external trade. I must therefore mention the need for increased international assistance in infrastructure development and institutional capacity-building, as well as industrialization and enhancement of productive capacity, for all developing countries, not only the least developed. Lesotho continues to support the maintenance of international peace and security. We are deeply disturbed by the ongoing violence in Syria and other parts of the Middle East. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has added another dimension to the scourge of international terrorism. It has become a force of destruction and generates mayhem on a global scale. We are encouraged by recent efforts aimed at shrinking the boundaries of the territories controlled by ISIL in Iraq and Syria. As a result of the ongoing violence in the Middle East and elsewhere, the worldâ??s refugee population has grown; there are more than 65 million displaced persons, including those fleeing hunger. That situation is intolerable, as it has created an environment in which young people have become vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist movements and human trafficking. In recent years, Lesotho has faced prolonged droughts due to the El NiÃ±o effect, which crippled the entire Southern African subcontinent and led to food shortages and other hardships. The recent hurricanes that have devastated the Caribbean and parts of the United States, along with the torrential rains that have been witnessed in many countries, including floods of biblical proportions, are a stark reminder that climate change is with us and that urgent action is required in accordance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was concluded more than a year ago. We reiterate our appeal that small countries such as Lesotho, including small island States, should be empowered with technologies for dealing with and adapting to climate-change challenges. Sustainable development will elude us without genuine commitment on the part of all, including our development partners. The principles of common but differentiated responsibility and economic might and capability between developed and developing nations will be critical to our success in building a sustainable world. We therefore call on the international community to continue mobilizing and providing additional financial resources to Africa for climate-friendly technologies to address both the urgent adaptation and mitigation needs of Africa and other developing countries. Similarly, we urge countries that have reneged on their support to the Paris Agreement to reconsider their position and return to the fold. The eradication of colonialism is one of the most notable achievements accomplished by the international community through the United Nations. However, that business remains unfinished. The questions of Western Sahara and Palestine have defied solutions for a long time. We reiterate our support for Western Sahara in its struggle for self-determination. Every day that passes without a change in the lives of the people of Western Sahara is a reminder to the world that we must renew our determination to fight the injustices perpetrated against the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. History will judge us harshly if we watch in silence as unjust treatment is meted out to the people of that African country. Our silence and inaction will leave an indelible mark of failure on our collective character. In the modern world the use of colonial tactics is totally unacceptable. In that connection, we call on the United Nations to remain resolute in its determination to rid the world of the scourge of colonialism. The agreement by the POLISARIO Front and Morocco to resume negotiations in order to reach a long-term solution has not gone unnoticed. We commend them for that bold step and assure them of our support in that noble endeavour. The question of Palestine has been on the United Nations agenda for decades. We continue to believe that a two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders, whereby Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in equal sovereignty, is the most viable proposal for a permanent settlement to that vexing problem. The Palestinians too deserve to enjoy the right to peace, development and the sanctity of life. Concerning the nuclear-disarmament landscape, the United Nations made significant progress a few months ago with the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons with the goal of eventually achieving their total elimination. That is a historic achievement, especially in the light of the ongoing tensions in the Korean peninsula. The argument that nuclear weapons are a deterrent is a fallacy. Such weapons are a threat to human existence, and their possessors should do the right thing and renounce them in line with their international obligations. The Treaty should not remain a mere paper agreement; it must be ratified and implemented by all. As I conclude, I would like to point out that we should continue to resist all attempts to undermine the global consensus that the United Nations has built around many issues of importance to our peoples. We remain convinced that it is the only universal institution that can safeguard world peace and ensure the survival of all and sundry. For it to do so, however, the reform agenda of the United Nations must proceed without further delay, including reform of the Security Council. A Council that is transparent and representative of all regions, including Africa, will go a long way to fulfilling the ideals for which the United Nations was founded. Unilateral actions that defy civility and international law belong to the past. Let us march forward with unity of purpose, while focusing on our peoples and striving for peace so that we can all have a decent life.",1,196
7805,Session 72 - 2017,LTU_72_2017.txt,LTU_72_2017,72,2017,LTU,"The topic of this yearâ??s debate invites us to focus on people and our responsibility to ensure their peaceful and sustainable future. However, in todayâ??s world, such a peaceful future is threatened as never before. Authoritarian regimes continue to kill with impunity, extremist ideologies treat innocent people with unspeakable cruelty, and thousands die after leaving their homes in search for a better and more peaceful life. The worldâ??s attention is now focused on North Korea and in some other regions, but the same kinds of blackmail, bullying and aggression that we see there are also being used by Russia in Ukraine and along NATOâ??s eastern border. As we speak, approximately 100,000 Russian troops are engaged in Exercise Zapad 2017 â?? offensive military exercises on the borders of Baltic States, Poland and even in the Arctic. The Kremlin is rehearsing aggressive scenarios against its neighbours, training its army to attack the West. The exercise is also part of information warfare that aims to spread uncertainty and fear. It is even more disturbing that the Zapad 2017 exercise is just one symptom of the Kremlinâ??s inability to finally end its hatred towards the West. Despite Russiaâ??s special responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council to protect international peace, it violated the Charter of the United Nations by attacking Georgia, illegally annexing Crimea and directly participating in the war in the east of Ukraine. The Kremlinâ??s arsenal does not stop at conventional weapons. Russia continues to meddle in elections and conduct cyberattacks, and it uses its sputniks to spread fake news and destabilizing propaganda. Energy blackmail has long been Russiaâ??s weapon of choice. For example, in Belarus, just 40 kilometres from Lithuaniaâ??s capital, it is building the unsafe Astravyets nuclear power plant as a geopolitical weapon that fails to comply with basic international nuclear standards. Abuses and indifference to basic international norms by regimes across the world are not unrelated. Too often they are a result of our collective failure to condemn or properly react to violations. Time and time again we lack the courage to enforce the rules that we ourselves have established. We draw red lines in the sand and then pretend they do not exist. That has to change. Bullies are aggressive precisely because they are weak and insecure, which is why we must stop being passive observers and start calling things by their real names. Aggression can never make anyone stronger. It can never earn anyone a single drop of respect. The only thing that aggression will bring about is contempt, shame and condemnation. The international community has to take a share of responsibility. We cannot let fear win by closing our eyes to violators, because that will only encourage them to go further. We must learn to read the warning signs, because abuse of human rights, nationalist rhetoric and the suppression of free speech explode into violence if ignored. Finally, we must change the United Nations. This unique universal body was created to save the world from wars and instability. So far it has failed to fulfil that purpose. We now face a choice â?? we either give the Organization the voice to rise up against the abuse, or we render it irrelevant.",1,196
7806,Session 72 - 2017,LUX_72_2017.txt,LUX_72_2017,72,2017,LUX,"At the outset, allow me to congratulate you, Minister Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. You are a long-standing friend, and I know that you will be able to successfully carry out the task entrusted to you. My thoughts today are especially with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, which have been repeatedly struck by misfortune. My country is doing everything in its power to assist them in those humanitarian emergencies. My message is simple. In a context where crisis hotbeds are proliferating and tensions are increasing, it is multilateralism that must prevail, meaning cooperation, dialogue and seeking solutions within the multilateral framework. More than ever, multilateralism and cooperation must take precedence over unilateral approaches and national selfishness, in the interests of our common good and our common humanity. When facing crises, the world expects a lot from the United Nations. The appointment of our new Secretary- General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, through an unprecedented process characterized by greater transparency, grants him new legitimacy that he can put to the service of his work and that of the Organization itself. It also allows him to initiate three major reform projects â?? as he has indicated, with regard to the management of the Secretariat, the reorganization of the peace and security pillar and the repositioning of the United Nations development system. A rationalization of the latter, both at Headquarters and in the field, is of particular interest to my country, as 30 per cent of our official development assistance is channelled through multilateral organizations. Reform efforts must be borne on all fronts and all aspects of our Organization. In that regard, progress is still to be made on the part of the Security Council. It must become more transparent, even though efforts have been made in that area. It must become more representative of todayâ??s world. It is also worth remembering that Security Council membership carries obligations as well as rights. We regret that in the past 12 months we have seen abusive use of the right of the veto. Luxembourg was one of the first to advocate the code of conduct for the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group to prevent crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We also strongly support the French-Mexican initiative, whereby relevant States give up their right to the veto in the event of mass atrocity. For the United Nations to be able to implement an ambitious agenda, it must have sufficient resources. However, the budgetary situation of the United Nations remains difficult, notably, but not solely, because of the new approach by the American Administration. That may prevent agencies from fulfilling their core mission. Clearly, we need to go back to the drawing board. My country supports the idea of a budgetary compact for development. Luxembourg contributes 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance. Our annual voluntary contributions to the various agencies is in excess of $35 million for 2017. The funding requirements for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are enormous. Progress has been made in terms of funding to combat climate change. To take the case of Luxembourg, my country has set up a green stock exchange with a current capitalization of more than â?¬57 billion. We plan to use that model to set up future instruments for sustainable development financing on the basis of a broader range of development goals. At the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July, Luxembourg presented its voluntary national review for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The preparation of that review enriched the debate in my country, enabling us to mobilize efforts and strengthen ownership among all stakeholders of the 2030 Agenda. Those efforts will translate into the adoption of a new sustainable development plan that will guide the work of the public authorities and that of civil society and private-sector actors in the decade ahead. My country acts with conviction within both a European and a multilateral framework. The context of globalization means that there is no other choice. That is true in the area of trade, even though bilateral regional agreements may complement that framework. That is also true in a whole series of other areas, above all in the fight against climate change. We are fully committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we regret that one of the major international actors has distanced itself from that instrument. We hope that it will be possible to bring that actor back, as it is true that a truly global framework would not be complete without it. I would also like to point out my countryâ??s support for the French initiative of a global pact for the environment, which will be able to provide a political framework in the future, giving coherence to all existing instruments. If there is one phenomenon that is more a product of globalization than any other, it is population movements. There are multiple reasons for that, such as demographic pressure, climate change, conflict and humanitarian disasters. Understandable economic motives, both in countries of origin and in countries of destination, are also often the basis for such movements. In any case, that is a problem that needs to be addressed, and it is very useful that it should be dealt with at the level of our Organization. Next year will see the establishment of new instruments with regard to both refugees and migration. The dividing line between the two will not always be easy to draw. With regard to migration, the current phase has allowed us to take stock of the situation, which does not always correspond to preconceived notions. First, there is the fact that most of the major transregional movements today are South-South movements. Secondly, there is the fact that, depending on the circumstances, many countries are simultaneously countries of origin, countries of transit and host countries. It is therefore an issue that goes beyond a single North-South logic, although I do not deny the difficulties and concerns arising from the European refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. Many refugees were forced to move either due to legitimate concerns for their physical safety or humanitarian disasters arising from conflicts. In that regard, the situation in the Middle East continues to raise concerns. Beyond the persistent obstacles to seeking a political solution between Israel and Palestine, the situations in Syria and Yemen are apocalyptic, Libya is engulfed by violence and civil war, and new tensions are emerging in the Gulf countries. The international community must do everything in its power to reduce those tensions. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has lost none of its core importance. The total absence of credible political prospects could lead at any moment to a new eruption of violence and creates fertile ground for hatred and terrorism. Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), adopted on 23 December 2016, which again calls on Israel to immediately and completely cease all its settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, is not directed against Israel. The resolution targets a status quo that has become untenable and unacceptable. It aims to contribute to ensuring peace for Israel. The recent announcement of general elections being organized in Palestine offers a slight hope for reconciliation. We must seize that opportunity, which also, clearly, requires responsibility on the part of Palestinian leaders, and I have trust in President Abbas in that regard. By continuing settlement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Israeli Government is directly jeopardizing the two-State solution, the only fair and equitable way to make possible a lasting solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this fiftieth year of Israeli occupation, the trend on the ground is very worrying. But that is not a reason to give up. On the contrary, the international community must mobilize to change the situation. In Syria, all stakeholders must realize that peace will return only if a comprehensive, genuine, inclusive political transition is implemented. In this seventh year of the conflict, a lasting political solution depends upon the commitment of countries that can exert political, military or economic influence on the warring parties in Syria. Every effort must be made to ensure that negotiations in Geneva under the United Nations continue and make progress. The Astana process alone is not enough. We should improve humanitarian access and extend the de-escalation zones and local ceasefires, which remain a glimmer of hope for a ravaged population. In Iraq, it was announced that a referendum would be held on 25 September 2018 in the Kurdistan region. Our position is to support the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. A united, stable and democratic Iraq should guarantee the interests of all citizens. The federal Government and the Kurdish Regional Government established excellent cooperation during the horrible military campaign against Daâ??esh. The differences that remain between them must be resolved through a peaceful and constructive dialogue that leads to an agreed solution in the framework of the Iraqi Constitution. We have to do everything we can to calm the situation in the region. It also means maintaining and rigorously implementing the Iran nuclear deal, which helps to reduce the risk of proliferation. The agreement was signed not only bilaterally between the United States and Iran, but also by the European Union, Russia, China, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, as well as being endorsed by Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). That is also important in the context of the North Korean regimeâ??s headlong rush, which is multiplying provocations by accelerating its nuclear and ballistic programme through nuclear tests and missile launches. That is unacceptable and, like many other countries, Luxembourg strongly condemns those acts by Pyongyang. The Security Council has just strengthened the sanctions regime, and the European Union will do the same. Only the determination and the resolve of the international community will bring the regime back to reason, and hopefully to the negotiation table. If we call for resolve, we must also avoid an escalation that would lead to a catastrophe. To reach true de-escalation, we must not close the door to diplomacy and dialogue. The Iran agreement can serve as an inspiration in that regard. It demonstrates that an appropriate policy, combining pressure and dialogue, can lead to results. Africa continues to mobilize the energies of international actors in the areas of development, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, conflict prevention and combating terrorism. The political and humanitarian situations in South Sudan, around Lake Chad, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are extremely worrying. As in the case of the Sahel and Mali, such situations are often the result of non-State actors, which render a number of mechanisms inoperative. Luxembourg is committed to the activities of its African partners, including at the regional level. We will therefore support the deployment of the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel. In that context, it is also essential to develop the various instruments of international criminal justice. We must continue to support the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose scope should be extended. I would like to say here how pleased we are that the trend towards disengagement by African States has been halted. Clearly, the scope of the ICC is not confined to Africa, and any such perception should be avoided. We have supported the international, impartial and independent inquiry mechanism on the most serious crimes committed in Syria since March 2011. We call upon all Member States to participate in financing the mechanism before it can be incorporated into the United Nations regular budget. We also support initiatives on the responsibility of Daâ??esh for the crimes committed in Iraq, as endorsed today by the Security Council. The current session of the General Assembly focuses on people and their right to peace and a decent life. Human rights and the dignity of the human being must guide all our actions. All of the situations I have just mentioned give rise to human rights violations. In a cruel irony, those violations are sometimes also committed by those who were least expected to do so. I congratulate Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for having referred the extreme deterioration of the situation of the ethnic and religious minority in Myanmar â?? the Rohingya minority â?? to the Security Council. The Burmese authorities must cease military operations and ensure humanitarian access. Ethnic cleansing has no place in the twenty-first century, not in Myanmar or anywhere else. Human trafficking, sexual exploitation in conflict situations and violations of the rights of children in armed conflict situations are all scourges that are unfortunately still raging. We must not be content with denouncing them, but ensure that we support and strengthen our financial and human resources, including the institutions that counter those scourges. The right to dignity is also reflected in respect for the physical integrity of women and girls. In recent decades, we have been able to reduce maternal mortality by almost half, but access by women and girls to sexual and reproductive rights in health care is now being challenged in some parts of the world. Every day, more than 800 women and adolescent girls die from pregnancy-related causes. More than 22 million unsafe abortions are recorded each year. Those statistics are horrifying. That is why Luxembourg, alongside our partners such as Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, has joined the SheDecides initiative by providing â?¬2 million in additional funding this year to support the United Nations Population Fund. Womenâ??s health is one of the top priorities of Luxembourgâ??s health strategy and cooperation. I assure the Assembly that my country will continue to support the access of girls and women to sexual and reproductive rights and health. Sometimes defending human rights is reduced to its simplest expression â?? no more or less than ensuring the physical survival of the population. I mentioned catastrophic humanitarian situations in several countries. Luxembourg responded to the United Nations appeal to the famine crisis in three African countries and Yemen. For those four countries â?? Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen â?? my country has pledged more than â?¬10 million in 2017. We are also a signatory to the Grand Bargain on humanitarian financing, which gives more flexibility, predictability and continuity to international humanitarian efforts. I mentioned our Organization and the world. Let me say a few words about Europe. Europe is not immune to the tensions in the international order, or should I say, international disorder? In Ukraine, the past year was marked by renewed hostilities, with numerous violations of the ceasefire, despite the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Trilateral Contact Group. I hope that the Normandy format talks can continue and lead the parties to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to guarantee the territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of Ukraine. Europe is not immune to the upheavals of globalization, either. It is victim to repeated acts of pointless and indiscriminate acts of terrorism. It is also a place where nationalist movements are fuelled by an anti-immigrant or anti-refugee backlashes. Moreover, sharing the burden of taking in refugees has been far from exemplary in some communities, but also in some States, including European Union member States. And yet, while they were capable of adding momentum to the worst fears a year ago, populist movements are on the decline in Europe, even if they are often an electoral reality. The taking in of hundreds of thousands of refugees occurs year in year out, and there is renewed optimism, including prospects for economic growth. I call for a Europe that rejects withdrawal into isolation, a Europe free of conflict that does not give way to intimidation, not even in its own neighbourhood, a Europe that puts the person at the centre of its efforts and which is resolutely committed to the multilateral system. The tensions in the international system are the result of major trends such as growing inequality, migratory flows and climate change. They pit two visions against each other â?? one based on force, the law of the jungle, unilateralism and national selfishness, even nationalism; the other on the primacy of multilateralism, solidarity, universal values, human rights and the rule of law. Luxembourg is committed to the latter vision. The challenges I have outlined need to be tackled in a multilateral system with strong institutions â?? a multilateral system inspired by the Charter of the United Nations, which enshrines human dignity and the sovereign equality of all States. That is the best recourse for the vast majority of the States of the international community and for the peoples of the United Nations, which we represent here. At its heart, multilateralism is the foundation of the United Nations. To challenge it would be to question the inspiration behind the United Nations â?? the creation of an international order based on the rule of law, in the service of peace and freedom.",1,196
7807,Session 72 - 2017,LVA_72_2017.txt,LVA_72_2017,72,2017,LVA,"First of all, I would like to express my solidarity to the Mexican people, who are dealing with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. At the outset, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k, on assuming the post of President of the General Assembly at its current session. I am sure you will make our region proud. The United Nations is, and will be, the central forum for multilateralism and a rules-based global order. This is the place where all nations come together to carry out our shared responsibility to deliver peace and security, advance human rights and sustainable development and cooperate for a better future. As the truly global Organization, the United Nations must be able to effectively respond to the serious global issues that we face: regional conflicts and humanitarian crises, the threat of terrorism, insecurity related to migration, climate change and poverty. Individuals and their need for peace and a decent life are at the centre of all those challenges. We must be able to deliver on those needs as individual nations and as the United Nations. It is no secret that the Organization has grown too complex and bureaucratic to be able to respond swiftly to todayâ??s challenges. Some even question its credibility and relevance. Latvia also wishes to see the United Nations become more effective, more transparent and more flexible so that it can can make a positive, real influence for people on the ground. While the most recent global agreements have shown that effective multilateralism is possible, we must bring the values and goals of the United Nations closer to the people. The United Nations must preserve and, in some instances, regain, the trust of citizens and Member States in its ability to prevent and respond to crises and to promote a rules-based global order. The new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, was appointed on a platform of change. Latvia welcomes his appointment and fully supports his vision of a more effective United Nations. The Secretary- Generalâ??s actions and ideas related to qualitative change and reforms in the United Nations are very encouraging signs. Reform is never an easy task, but with patience, clear goals and the cooperation of the United Nations system and Member States, reform is possible. The Secretary-General has our full support for his endeavours. All people on the planet need peace. For people to fully realize their potential, a stable and secure environment is essential. In too many places, conflicts seem to have no end. The very basic principles of international law are violated, borders are changed by force and human lives suffer. Far too often, the United Nations has been unable to prevent conflicts, stop atrocities or build peace. Too often, resources are spent managing and responding to crises instead of preventing them. The Security Council bears a particular responsibility for ensuring peace. Its members, especially the veto-wielding members, should move beyond their domestic interests in the name of genuinely addressing global challenges. People see the failures of the Security Council as failures of the Organization. We cannot expect trust in the United Nations if the Security Council does not deliver. Latvia also reiterates its call for reform of the Security Council, which is long overdue. From his first day on the job, the Secretary-General has made a strong appeal for peace and the prevention of conflicts. We fully support him in that endeavour. Conflict prevention must be at the core of actions of the United Nations in order to keep situations of concern from spiralling out of control. Saving human lives and upholding human dignity must be our common priority. Tools for prevention have long been available, including in the Charter of the United Nations, but we need to move from mere commitments to preserve a rules-based global order to actions to restore that order where it has been broken. Latvia will continue to promote democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law as key factors for global stability. Security is truly a global issue today. In particular, Latvia is deeply worried about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. North Koreaâ??s actions have increased global insecurity. Latvia strongly condemns all nuclear tests and launches of ballistic missiles conducted by North Korea, as well as its continuous provocative rhetoric. We call on North Korea to return to a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community and to refrain from any further action that would increase regional tensions. It is a priority to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution to that situation. In the meantime, all States must fully implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. The use of chemical weapons in Syria, which blatantly disregards Syriaâ??s obligations as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, is a deplorable crime that must be fully investigated. The perpetrators must be held accountable. Latvia has constantly called for accountability regarding those attacks, an accountability that is closely linked to the credibility of the whole international system. For that reason, Latvia has supported the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for the Syrian Arab Republic to assist the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes committed in Syria. We will continue to support the Syrian people and the United Nations-led political process towards a political resolution of that bloody conflict, which has lasted far too long. Global terrorism is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The unwavering efforts of the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh have degraded the capabilities of Daâ??esh across all fronts. Latvia welcomes the important victories achieved, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq. However, our fight is far from over, and we have to think about new strategies and secure new domains as the threat of terrorism becomes more asymmetric and globally dispersed. Besides military efforts, we must continue to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, dismantle financing networks and counter online and offline propaganda that sets youth on a path towards radicalization. We are pleased to see that the Riga Protocol on foreign terrorist fighters â?? the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism â?? entered into force in July. We encourage more States to accede to that instrument in order to address the threat at hand, which affects countries of origin and of destination. International support will be required to help stabilize liberated areas in Syria and Iraq in order to allow refugees and internally displaced persons to return and start rebuilding their lives. Latvia provides training to Iraqi security forces and financial support for stabilization efforts. Solving existing conflicts is essential for preventing new ones. We must stand firm in upholding the rules-based security order in Europe. The territorial integrity of independent States must be respected by all, including by the Russian Federation. Russiaâ??s unprovoked aggression against its neighbours is a serious breach of international security rules. There must be accountability for violations of international law for any aggressor that initiates or sustains such conflicts. A peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and respect for Ukraineâ??s sovereignty and territorial integrity are priorities for Latvia. Russiaâ??s continued aggression in eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol cannot become business as usual. We support diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis under the Normandy format and within the framework of the Trilateral Contact Group so as to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all the parties involved. International monitors must be granted access to Crimea, and human rights violations against residents of Crimea, including Crimean Tatars, must stop. The United Nations, along with the relevant regional actors, should remain involved in, and committed to, facilitating the resolution of the protracted conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Last year I stressed that the strengthening of the development and security nexus must become our mission. Our priority must be to achieve peace and a decent life for everyone, including the most vulnerable among us. We must tackle the root causes preventing us from attaining sustainable development. If conflicts, hardship and poverty continue, migration and the flow of refugees will further increase. The far- reaching impact of climate change on global security cannot simply be disregarded. We must carry on with our joint commitment to tackle climate change so that coming generations can live sustainably on this planet in a sustainable way. Latvia is fully committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Now is the time to put in place the mechanisms of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That needs to be done at all levels â?? national, regional and global â?? in true partnership with all stakeholders. We welcome the current review of the United Nations development system to fulfil the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda. Next year Latvia will present a voluntary national review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. Our national focus is to put people first, as that will lead to long-lasting development gains. Latvia is ready to share its experience with implementing the 2030 Agenda through development cooperation. To enjoy peace and development, our societies need space and institutions for free, open and enlightened public debate where truth can be sought, knowledge shared and lies exposed. Such belief is also at the heart of our approach to countering purposeful and malicious propaganda and disinformation emanating from both State and non-State actors. Our answer to that challenge is to reassert the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and press and the independence of the media. Both nationally and internationally, we are committed to supporting the development of independent, professional, transparent and objective media and journalism, and to increasing the resilience of our societies by investing in stronger critical thinking skills, as well as media and information literacy. In conclusion, let me reiterate that Latvia remains a strong advocate of the multilateral system and believes in an effective and efficient United Nations, guided by the values on which it was founded. It is time for the United Nations to adapt to a changing global environment, focus on priorities and deliver results. The Secretary-General cannot do that alone. We all must work together to ensure that our Organization functions better and is fit for its purpose.",1,196
7808,Session 72 - 2017,MAR_72_2017.txt,MAR_72_2017,72,2017,MAR,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to wish him every success in his noble task. We would also like to commend his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his excellent work and the successes that his presidency brought. We would like to reiterate our support for the efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to reform the United Nations and its mechanisms on the political, economic and security fronts. The proposed reforms create new dynamics, giving new momentum to the Organizationâ??s activities and strengthening the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We would also like to express the support of the Kingdom of Morocco for the road map that the Secretary-General has proposed for mediation and preventive diplomacy in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, building on efforts to maintain peace, realize sustainable development and combat terrorism. Our world today is at a crossroads that is having a direct effect on our collective efforts to achieve sustainable development, strengthen peace and security and lay the foundations of cooperation, and I would therefore like to address three relevant issues. First, there can be no doubt that while walls between nations have come down and the numbers of victims have diminished, there have emerged new threats to security, such as terrorism, extremism, separatist movements and climate change, that are no less dangerous than previous ones. It is clear that while globalization has greatly boosted the international economy, it also triggered the economic and financial crisis that led to increased unemployment and poverty and deepened social differences within States. Secondly, while information technology has witnessed great developments, including expanded networks and growing numbers of users, some terrorist organizations have sought to use those developments to undermine security and stability, threaten the peace of individuals and erode development efforts, while still others have used them to advance their criminal enterprises. This situation, which gives a glimpse of the future of our world, is very threatening because we are unable to foresee what is coming. We therefore have to reform our collective working mechanisms in order to improve their predictive capacities. Thirdly, there are those who believe that they have the ability and resources to fend for themselves against these difficulties. However, the Kingdom of Morocco believes that only an effective, multilateral global organization can resolve the collective problems that we are all facing. We can no longer look at Africa as a burden on the international community. We Africans do not believe that our continent has ever been a burden on the world, despite the misunderstandings and unfair rulings and judgements that exist. Africa has yet to take its proper place on the worldâ??s agenda, which cannot be based on the numbers of conferences dedicated to it, related agenda items taken up or resolutions adopted. The continentâ??s problems cannot be addressed through the mere provision of assistance. Given its varied natural and human resources â?? including approximately a billion young people â?? its fertile lands and abundant water, Africa has enormous potential. Thanks to the foresight of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, over the past two decades Morocco has made South-South cooperation the basis of its foreign policy, reflecting the Kingâ??s view that such cooperation represents a promising foundation for the efforts of the international community. Morocco has adopted a realistic approach to forging partnerships and is supplying human resources and technological know-how to assist African countries in their efforts. In an address to the people of Morocco on 20 August 2016, His Majesty emphasized that Morocco does not view Africa as a market for the sale and promotion of Moroccan products or as a source of quick profits, but as a forum for joint action to save the region and develop African cities. That is why we have sought to establish partnerships with a number of African countries aimed at supporting economic growth and integration and providing jobs and security. That was not a decision fuelled by opportunism but a historic commitment emerging from the Kingâ??s deep understanding of the continent, as he expressed at the twenty-eighth session of the Summit of the African Union when he said, â??Africa is my continent. Africa is my homeâ??. With the same commitment and determination, Morocco will continue to shoulder its responsibility within the African Union as a founding member of its precursor, the Organization of African Unity, and as a committed partner that has never disappointed the African continent but rather has always defended it in regional and international forums. We are always eager to serve Africa and realize its ambitions and objectives. Morocco is committed to multilateralism and to finding the right answers to problems, based on the international communityâ??s three important areas of responsibility â?? migration, climate change and the fight against terrorism and extremism â?? and attested to by the confidence that the international community has placed in Morocco, which bases its approach on aligning its national priorities with those on the United Nations agenda and on sharing its experience with African partners. As Chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, Morocco, along with the Netherlands, works to strengthen national and regional cooperation and to share its experience in combating terrorism with its African brothers and partners by sharing information and expertise, as well as through religious training programmes that reject all forms of intolerance and extremism and that have reached hundreds of thousands of imams and leaders, men and women, of various African nationalities, at centres such as the Institute of Mohammed V and the Mohammed VI Foundation for African Ulema. Morocco co-chairs the Global Forum on Migration and Development, which seeks to develop proposals that are not limited to security issues but are also informed by the development and human aspects of migration. We hope those efforts will be included in the global compact on migration to be adopted by the United Nations in 2018. Within the African Union, King Mohammed will be presenting a concept paper on developing a joint African approach to migration and its root causes. Morocco has also developed a strategy for activating a process that can help African citizens south of the Sahara fully enjoy their economic and social rights. With regard to climate change, Morocco presided over the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Marrakech in November 2016. Qualitative changes were made during the session in translating the Paris Agreement on Climate Change into practical measures, as well as the adoption of the Marrakech Declaration, which states that efforts to achieve development and sustainable development represent a high-level political commitment that should be honoured with a balanced and cooperative approach that meets the needs of least developed countries and developing nations. Africa is at the heart of Moroccoâ??s interests in this regard. His Majesty chaired the first African summit on climate change, which resulted in an ambitious and balanced action plan that reflects the continentâ??s commitment to shouldering its responsibilities with regard to international efforts. At the national level, Morocco has adopted an ambitious policy for addressing the effects of climate change, particularly where renewable energy is concerned. It should reduce our energy needs by 42 per cent by 2020 and 52 per cent by 2030, as well as lowering our carbon dependency. It should also attract promising international investment in the development of clean energy. Since the 1960s, the Kingdom of Morocco has been committed to the United Nations cause in deploying peacekeeping forces in Africa. We have contributed to those international forces by sending military units totalling 6,000 soldiers to six countries â?? Angola, the Congo, Somalia, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, where there are currently more than 1,600 Moroccan military personnel. I would like to express Moroccoâ??s deep concern about the irresponsible attacks that have recently been made on international peacekeepers. Such attacks trample on United Nations values and should be considered war crimes whose perpetrators should be brought to justice. The Kingdom of Morocco shares the Organizationâ??s concern about such attacks and therefore requests that the Secretariat take appropriate measures to protect peacekeepers in conflict zones. Today, we need a new approach to peacekeeping operations, making troop-contributing countries central to their decision-making in a way that is based on the values of the United Nations. The Palestinian question was one of the first just causes taken up by the United Nations following its inception, yet no solution has been found to date, nor is any agreement in sight, despite the tremendous efforts made by the international community, especially the current United States Administration. The Kingdom of Morocco, whose King Mohammed VI chairs the Al-Quds Al-Sharif Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, reiterates its rejection of any attempts aimed at changing the historical and legal status of the Holy City and the Al-Aqsa Mosque and renews its calls to the Israeli authorities to cease such practices. The Arab Maghreb is still dealing with the difficult issues that have resulted from the lack of political cooperation and the vulnerable security situation produced by the crisis in Libya. This raises questions for the parties that are still dealing with past conflicts, such as in the Moroccan Sahara. If the international community wishes to achieve a peaceful settlement based on consensus, and if the Moroccan initiative for self-rule there is to gain more support, the parties in the region involved in that dispute should abandon their two-faced discourse and assume their responsibilities. Morocco would like to emphasize its readiness to work in honestly and transparently with the Secretary- General and Mr. Horst KÃ¶hler, his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, in order to reach a peaceful settlement that can maintain Moroccoâ??s territorial integrity and sovereignty, based on the self-rule initiative. Morocco is also developing a policy to enable the people of the Moroccan Sahara to rule themselves and thus to enable North-West Africa to mitigate the dangers of separatism, Balkanization, extremism and terrorism. In that context, we would like to call the Assemblyâ??s attention to the terrible situation in the Tindouf refugee camps and urge the international community to put pressure on the host country to allow the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to respond to the Secretary-Generalâ??s call and register everyone in the camps.",1,196
7809,Session 72 - 2017,MCO_72_2017.txt,MCO_72_2017,72,2017,MCO,"I would like to begin by telling the President how pleased I am to see him conducting the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We wish him success in the accomplishment of this important and delicate task in the service of the international community. I have an excellent memory of my official visit to Slovakia last May. On that occasion I was able to appreciate his work and to consolidate the good relations between our two States. â??Peace must be our goal and guideâ??. But â??without a healthy environment we cannot end poverty and build prosperityâ??. Those are the words of the Secretary- General, and current circumstances give those words special resonance. It is clear that the threat of nuclear escalation in Asia has never been greater, and that notion can leave no leader indifferent. In accordance with its obligations, Monaco complies with the Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. Respecting the commitments that apply to each Member State is paramount. We therefore refuse to be powerless witnesses of the indefensible stances that pose a grave danger to all our States. We condemn the irresponsibility of those who expose humankind to an irreversible disaster. Recognizing the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, Monaco continues to support collective efforts for the promotion of peace and security. As a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, Monaco participates actively in the work of those regional institutions. In that connection, the Principality pays particular attention to the work of the Special Monitoring Mission on the crisis in Ukraine and its vicinity. The Principality of Monaco, with 140 nationalities in its territory, has always been open to dialogue. Our country has been enriched by that diversity, which continues today. We are convinced that our common values â?? the defence of human rights, of democracy and of the rule of law â?? are among the ongoing priorities of a modern State concerned with the welfare of its citizens and those who live on its soil. The ideals that unite us allow us to move forward together, as our goals remain unfulfilled. The fight against impunity is part and parcel of those ideals. Refusing to allow atrocity to dictate the law is a sine qua non condition of assumed sovereignty. The Principality of Monaco is fully committed to respect for justice and peace. That underpins our support for the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on the most serious crimes committed in Syria. To the best of its ability, Monaco will continue its contribution in terms of the assistance to that countryâ??s long-suffering civilian population in order to enable them to rebuild and imagine a better future. The situation in Africa, where over 20 million individuals are risk of losing their lives as a result of famine, will have serious consequences. Although drought is an exacerbating factor, it must be recognized that the primary cause for this humanitarian disaster is war. In keeping with our traditions, Monaco expresses solidarity by responding to the call of the United Nations for contributions to the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as to Monegasque non-governmental organizations. Above and beyond those urgent humanitarian actions, Monacoâ??s cooperation system implements a policy promoting the eradication of poverty and fostering sustainable development to serve the most vulnerable. My countryâ??s new strategic plan for official development assistance will work with public and private partners to respond to the most pressing needs â?? food security, health, education and job placement â?? beyond the mere duty to assist. Good governance, the fight against corruption, and sufficient public resources are not empty words, but rather assets without which no State can meet the basic needs of its population or establish its development policies in a long-lasting manner. Those crises serve only to further justify the Secretary-Generalâ??s advocacy for â??protection and respect for human rights and for the creation of decent work opportunities for young peopleâ??. Today, by depositing our instrument of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I once again wish to associate my country with the efforts of the international community to promote their fundamental freedom and dignity. As Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld so aptly observed, â??The United Nations was not created to lead mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell.â?? Attacks on innocent civilians affect us all, wherever they are perpetrated. We hope that the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism can bring us together in our determination to annihilate this barbarism. Climate change is putting humankind in imminent danger. The unprecedented violence of recent extreme weather events serve to prompt us once again to recognize our limitations. Faced with nature unleashed, people will always lose. Hurricanes and typhoons have tragic consequences whether they form in the Atlantic or the North Pacific. The Paris Climate Change Agreement has garnered 195 signatures and 159 States parties. That is the clearest proof of the urgency felt at the global level. Only by promoting global awareness and mobilizing all sectors of our societies can we adapt our economies successfully. Several States, including Monaco, as well as some private companies, have already announced major measures aimed at changing our modes of transport, production and consumption. In general, a change in our lifestyles is more than necessary; it is crucial. The joint UNICEF-World Health Organization report of 12 July on access to water and sanitation reveals glaring inequalities that continue to worsen. Too many people are still marginalized or living in unacceptable conditions. We must also resolutely persevere in the fight against all forms of serious violence against human dignity. In particular, we must work to improve the status of women as long as the discrimination and violence of which they are victims continues. Monaco welcomes the courageous initiative of the Secretary- General in that regard and yesterday signed the Voluntary Compact between the United Nations and Member States with a view to eliminating exploitation and sexual abuse in peace operations, humanitarian assistance, the promotion and protection of human rights and, more broadly, in the Organizationâ??s contribution to sustainable development. That commitment is a strong message that zero tolerance should become the norm for all States. I believe it is important today to reflect on the creation of the United Nations, if only to appreciate it more. This exercise in remembering can enable us to put our current difficulties into perspective and convince us â?? if we needed to be convinced â?? of the importance of this global Organization. That brings me to express my satisfaction with respect to the vision that the Secretary-General has put forward so that the Organization will be better able to assist its Member States in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We support him in his reform initiatives because we want a modern and efficient Organization where international civil servants, both at Headquarters and in its many fields of operation, are invested in a priority mission for which their work and self-sacrifice are recognized. In that regard, I would like to pay tribute to all those who undertake to fulfil this mission on the ground, sometimes, as we have sadly seen too often this year, by putting their lives at risk. It is up to us, the leaders gathered in this forum, to forge an ambitious consensus and provide realistic mandates and sufficient resources to the Organization. The first voluntary report from Monaco on its implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was presented at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July. Monaco, like every State here today, can now deal with ensuring the effectiveness of its choices with respect to the global goals that we adopted here two years ago. I would like to mention the Assemblyâ??s call to action on 9 June with its adoption of resolution 71/312, which recognized that the ocean is our future. The implementation of SDG 14 on marine life, has special significance, and the success of the Ocean Conference, which focused on it, showed us that the conservation and sustainable development of the oceans and seas and their resources are essential for our survival. We are fully and forever committed to our planet in general and to the oceans in particular. I firmly believe that our ability to save the ocean from gradual decline will help us save the planet. That is why I welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s visionary decision to appoint a Special Envoy for the Ocean, which highlights the challenges to be met and is greatly needed if we are to streamline our actions. There can be no doubt as to the dedication and unwavering commitment of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, Mr. Peter Thomson, whom we warmly congratulate both on the work he has accomplished in recent months and on his new responsibilities. We have great hopes for his ability to bring together the United Nations system, civil society, the private sector and academia to ensure that the targets of SDG 14 are met. It is therefore with great pride that the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco and the Prince Albert I Foundation will host him at the Maison des OcÃ©ans in Paris. In doing so, the Principality is continuing a tradition established by my great-great-grandfather â?? a prince, oceanographer and passionate scientist â?? one of whose ambitions was to make science accessible to all and to use new knowledge to improve the well-being of humankind. A few weeks ago I had the privilege of presenting, on the sidelines of the SDG 14 Conference, the Monaco Explorations initiative. The vessel Yersinâ??s three-year voyage around the world aims to increase our knowledge through marine biological research in association with local scientists, disseminate the results of our research and promote collective and concerted action in areas such as the creation of protected marine zones, while stimulating innovation. I would like to conclude by affirming my confidence in science, which enables us to base our decisions on proven and verifiable facts. Whether it reassures us or frightens us, science must spur us to action and thereby to moving forward together towards progress and the hope for a better world.",1,196
7810,Session 72 - 2017,MDA_72_2017.txt,MDA_72_2017,72,2017,MDA,"At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to wish him success in fulfilling his important mandate. My thanks also go to his predecessor Mr. Peter Thomson, for his dedication and professionalism in conducting the work of the previous session. I take this opportunity to express words of encouragement and support to the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres. I am confident that with his competent leadership and the joint efforts of the Member States, we will succeed in redefining the role of the United Nations and adjusting it to the requirements of the modern world. Clearly, all of us gathered in this great Hall are deeply concerned about the challenges confronting the international community. The armed conflicts in the Middle East, protracted disputes, terrorism and violent extremism, and the affliction caused by poverty are only some of the problems undermining peace and sustainable development. We are equally concerned about the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons and the development of nuclear programmes. An international environment marked by threats to use force, including nuclear arms, greatly exacerbates peopleâ??s sense of insecurity and lack of trust. The devastating natural disasters occurring with increasing frequency in a warming world affect hundreds of millions of people, especially those living in extreme poverty. In that context, I would like to express our compassion and deep condolences to the countries and the families affected by the recent devastating hurricanes, as well as by the earthquake in Mexico. The statements by previous speakers show that we all have similar perceptions of global problems. Today more than ever, we need the joint commitment of all States Members of the United Nations to face those challenges. In that context, I would like to reiterate my countryâ??s full support for Secretary-General Guterresâ??s reform agenda, which puts renewed emphasis on conflict prevention, the repositioning of the development system and reform of the internal management of the United Nations in order to effectively address the worldâ??s major challenges. Since signing the European Union Association Agreement in June 2014, my country has engaged in a complex process of structural reforms aimed at building a modern society based on the European development model. Our efforts have concentrated on steadily consolidating the rule of law and developing a functioning market economy, as well emphasizing a prominent social dimension and respect for human rights. The strategic priorities for sectoral development include, first of all, modernizing infrastructure, managing resources efficiently, promoting a green economy and renewable energy and applying modern technologies in agriculture. We have also undertaken to reform the public administration and the public services, while ensuring gender equality and the promotion of youth. We have the political will needed to fully implement those reforms, and in that endeavour we will continue to rely on the support of our development partners, particularly the European Union and the United Nations. The Republic of Moldova fully shares the view that the prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts, in particular protracted ones, are indispensable conditions for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Considering the current lack of progress in settling protracted conflicts, there should be more direct involvement on the part of the appropriate United Nations bodies. We believe that no conflict in the world should be ignored by the United Nations, irrespective of whether it is on the Security Councilâ??s agenda or not. We appreciate the fact that the General Assembly has agreed to include and maintain on its agenda the item entitled â??Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and developmentâ??. Contrary to the fears of some, the General Assemblyâ??s deliberations on that item do not undermine the existing mechanisms for negotiating the settlement of conflicts in the area of the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development, made up of Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and the Republic of Moldova (GUAM). On the contrary, it is the continued monitoring of the situation in the area, together with a proactive approach by the United Nations when its involvement is needed, that can prevent or counter attempts aimed at changing the political borders of some GUAM States through methods that have nothing to do with democracy and international law. I take this opportunity to express the Republic of Moldovaâ??s deep concern about the ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, which endangers peace and security in our region, and to once again reiterate our full support for Ukraineâ??s sovereignty and territorial integritye. Since 1992, we have repeatedly referred from this rostrum to the unresolved conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova, which is also complicated by the illegal stationing of foreign military forces on our national territory. We have underlined that, unlike other, similar conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the Transnistrian conflict, while less intricate, could be resolved more easily if all the parties concerned displayed the necessary political will. In our case, there is no ethnic or religious enmity, and the populations on both banks of the Nistru River could live in peace and mutual understanding within a reintegrated Moldovan State. Despite our efforts over the past 25 years, including the involvement of international actors, we have not succeeded in settling this political conflict. We will continue to work to come up with a solution in the existing 5+2 settlement format. For us, it is extremely important that the solution be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, while providing a special status for the Transnistrian region, as stipulated in the relevant documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We firmly believe that the settlement process could be based on the transformation of the current trilateral peacekeeping force, which also includes a Russian contingent, into a multinational civilian mission with an international mandate. In that regard, I would like to emphasize that the trilateral disengagement force established in accordance with the Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of 21 July 1992 fulfilled its remit long ago. That obsolete mechanism has become a factor in preserving the conflict and has failed to ensure the full demilitarization of the security zone and eliminate obstacles to the free movement of people, goods and services. Contrary to our expectations, the Russian Federation has not yet withdrawn its military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with its international commitments as stipulated in the Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of July 1992, the Moldovan-Russian agreement of October 1994 and in the relevant OSCE documents, in particular the political declaration adopted at the OSCE Istanbul Summit in 1999. I would like to make it clear that those military forces are distinct and should not be confused with the Russian contingent that participates in the trilateral peacekeeping force, which is operating on the basis of an ad hoc arrangement. The military exercises conducted regularly in the Transnistrian region by Russian troops, with the increased participation of paramilitary forces belonging to the separatist regime in Tiraspol, pose a continuing security threat to the Republic of Moldova. The joint military drills are in flagrant violation of express obligations stipulated in the Moldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of 1992. According to OSCE reports, the Operative Group of Russian Troops has stockpiled more than 21,000 metric tons of weapons and ammunition. The Government of the Republic of Moldova neither controls nor supervises those weapons and munitions. Due to the complete lack of access to those foreign-controlled stockpiles â?? some of which may pose substantial environmental danger â?? the munitionsâ?? technical condition cannot be assessed and transfers of them within that territory or outside it cannot be monitored. For the same reasons, the Republic of Moldova is unable to fulfil its international obligations as a State party under various international disarmament conventions. Although they are located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, those weapons and munitions are not under its jurisdiction or control. Taking into account the commitments of the Russian Federation, the fundamental principles of international law and the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova regarding its permanently neutral status and its non-admission of the deployment of other Statesâ?? military troops on its national territory, we firmly reiterate our request for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the so-called Operative Group of Russian Troops, a successor to the former fourteenth Soviet army, which is illegally stationed on the territory of the Republic of Moldova. In that context, I should also invoke the declaration on 21 July by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova that calls on the Russian Federation to resume and finalize the process of withdrawing its troops and munitions from the territory of the Republic of Moldova. Mindful that the United Nations has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security, the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations, requests the inclusion on the agenda of the seventy- second session of the General Assembly of a new item entitled â??Withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.â?? In that regard, I respectfully call on all States Members of the United Nations to support that legitimate request, which is fully compliant with the principles of the Charter and represents the fundamental interests of the Republic of Moldova. We hope that the inclusion of that item on the General Assemblyâ??s agenda and its further consideration by Member States in a constructive and non-politicized manner, will constitute an important and necessary exercise in preventive diplomacy, in a country and a region where the maintenance of peace and security is persistently undermined by a lack of dialogue based on mutual respect and respect for the fundamental principles of international law.",1,196
7811,Session 72 - 2017,MDG_72_2017.txt,MDG_72_2017,72,2017,MDG,"I am very proud and honoured to be addressing the General Assembly at its seventy-second session in my capacity not only as President of the Republic of Madagascar and on behalf of the Malagasy people, but also as President of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and current President of the Summit of la Francophonie. At the outset, I would like to welcome the election of Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k as President of the Assembly and to extend to him my sincerest and warmest congratulations. Madagascar, at his side as a Vice-President of the Assembly, which brings together the 193 States Members of the United Nations, and as host of the sixteenth Summit of la Francophonie, on 26 and 27 November 2016, can only share in the values and ideals that unite us here to achieve a more just and stable world together â?? development, peace, security and international law. The theme of our debate, â??Focusing on the human being: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, appeals to us all because the very raison dâ??Ãªtre of every State is to ensure its peopleâ??s welfare through the ways and means of their own choosing. For Madagascar, the choice is clear and obvious. We have placed and continue to place the human individual at the centre of our concerns. We therefore welcome the relevance of this yearâ??s theme, and I am happy to share with the Members of the Assembly what we have done and strive to do in Madagascar since 2014 to provide a better and decent life for the Malagasy. The challenges that awaited me in 2014 â?? when I was elected by the Malagasy people to preside over their destiny on the heels of our protracted emergence from a five-year political, economic and social crisis â?? were significant. The country and people had been overwhelmed by international sanctions for five years, which exacerbated the poverty rate, affecting 92 per cent of the population, and the incidence of food insecurity and malnutrition. The logical outcome of the crisis was political and social instability and an anaemic economy, not to mention corruption and insecurity. However, we stepped up to meet those challenges. We were fully convinced that Madagascar had no reason to remain poor, with its potential and its people, more than 50 per cent of whom are women and more than 61.3 per cent under 25 years of age. If everyone makes their own resolute contribution, then I truly believe â?? optimist that I am â?? in economic recovery and national reconstruction leading to renewed growth. Those three pillars will enable our State to consolidate a people-centred approach. In fact, like many of the leaders and high-ranking officials present in the Hall, I am an upbeat optimist about my country, my continent and our collective future. Faced with challenges, I often think about what Nelson Mandela said: â??After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. It always seems impossible until done.â?? There can be no doubt that this affirmation holds true for us all. Today, one year before Madagascarâ??s 2018 presidential elections, after continued and determined efforts, I can say that Madagascar has reached a milestone and a level that gives rise to the highest hopes, given the progress made in terms of both political stability, however fragile, and economic and social prospects. In that context, I can say that since 2016, Madagascar has raised $6.4 billion in global investment and aid from institutional donors. That has enabled us to start investing in key sectors of our economy and the future of our country. Worksites have been opened everywhere with a view to permanently reducing the poverty of my country and assisting our most vulnerable strata. Our efforts have included institutional standardization, good governance and the establishment of conditions conducive to improving the political climate, in particular through national reconciliation and implementation of our national development plan for revitalizing our economy through realizing the real potential of our wealth. Our policy of establishing basic infrastructure in many sectors is beginning to bear fruit. We have received support from our partners in implementing the bases of the 2015-2019 national development plan in agriculture, cattle-raising, energy and fisheries. Lastly, we have shown that Madagascar can play a part on the world stage by successfully hosting and organizing regional and international summits, including for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the Summit of la Francophonie, of which we are currently President. This year, we intend to pursue projects that include establishing special economic zones in two areas, creating pilot digital cities, accelerating our energy transition and strengthening basic infrastructure to improve education and public health. In the social sector, too, we are investing in education and training doctors, teachers and engineers. In order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4, my Government has developed an ambitious education sector plan to ensure that children in Madagascar have access to quality education. We are also investing in rebuilding our health-care system, which was gutted and destroyed during the years under sanctions. We have also reopened the health centres that were closed during the crisis periods in order to revitalize the network and expand it nationally. In general, we have established a platform for strengthening our health-care system to coordinate the health-related interventions of our various partners and improve our monitoring of disease. Madagascar has created a digital epidemiological surveillance system that enables it to monitor in real time 28 diseases that have the potential to become epidemics. In addition, the Government has taken steps to promote long-term actions such as launching universal health coverage and reducing maternal and infant mortality, a major aspect of maternal, newborn and child health. The budget for nutrition has been increased, agricultural production has been diversified and specific water, sanitation and nutrition projects targeting vulnerable populations have been implemented through our national nutrition action plan. We are also investing in infrastructure to create jobs and accelerate economic growth. We are investing in ports, highways, bridges and airports, which will reintegrate Madagascar into the global economy. We are also strengthening our tourism industry to create decent, paying jobs and preserve our unique and invaluable ecology and biodiversity. In that context, Madagascar has always sought to uphold its international commitments. The commitment we entered into in Durban in 2002 to tripling our protected area has been honoured; today those areas encompass more than 6.9 million hectares, in addition to our marine protected areas. In order to effectively tackle poverty, we must sustainably create wealth for the largest possible number of people while ensuring the responsible management of natural resources and combating global warming. We must also develop and implement appropriate sustainable development as quickly as possible. Low- carbon, inclusive and shared growth that creates jobs, in particular for women and young people, must be the economic model of tomorrow in order to ensure that future generations enjoy better living conditions in a protected environment. Given climate change and the threats to natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, we have no choice but to act quickly and we must not waste time. We therefore support the initiatives of the President of France aimed at putting a global environment pact in place. I take this opportunity to thank the Kingdom of Morocco for providing financial assistance to Madagascar, which is currently suffering from drought, in the framework of bilateral South-South cooperation. That is concrete action. Our agriculture, which accounts for 26.4 per cent of our overall gross domestic product and employs more than 75 per cent of the workforce, is considered one of the main drivers of our economy. We are making additional efforts to meet the challenges of establishing and developing agribusiness through land reform in order to enable peasants to own land. We are increasing productivity, building infrastructure, guiding production to allow access to markets, capital, seeds and inputs, and providing technical services and training. Given all of this, the economic outlook for Madagascar is favourable; our growth rate is around 4 per cent in 2017 and next year will exceed 5 per cent. That will create economic momentum and help to establish a new development trajectory for improving the lives of the people of Madagascar. Our aim is to raise Madagascar to the rank of a middle-income country by 2030. I take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that we have begun a reform process for improving the independence of our judiciary and our anti-corruption office. We have prepared measures to protect the integrity of our democratic processes, not to mention public security, which is a very sensitive area in Madagascar. The reforms we have undertaken have allowed us to enjoy lasting economic recovery, and I am convinced that this recovery will be supported by greater investment. Our economic growth rate is expected to reach more than 6 per cent per year by 2020. That is attainable. Yesterday, in his speech at the opening of the general debate, the President of the General Assembly expressed the hope that next year his successor would be able to commend the progress made at the seventy-second session of the General Assembly with regard to such global challenges as the state of global peace and security, global disparities and inequalities, persistent poverty, the outrageous fact that we have more than 65 million refugees, international terrorism, human rights, the preservation of the planet and so forth. The General Assembly already has the tools it needs to do this, and now it is a matter of strengthening them and improving the way they are used by emphasizing prevention. Madagascar will support the President in that regard. This is also an opportunity for me to reiterate from the magnificent sounding board that is the rostrum of the General Assembly the appeal launched in Antananarivo at the sixteenth Summit of la Francophonie: â??Our Francophone community, aware of its responsibilities and based on the Antananarivo Declaration, is determined to work for shared growth, sustainable and responsible development, and the establishment of fairer and more united economic relations by strengthening our dialogue and influence in international forums. By holding high our values of solidarity and sharing for a more peaceful world, we call for a new model of sustainable and inclusive development that responds to the concerns and meets the expectations of our peoples.â?? We must also recall the importance of investing in youth. I was pleased to learn yesterday that the first meeting of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, which was established at the initiative of the Secretary- General, will be held next year. Madagascar expresses its readiness to work closely with the United Nations to sustainably eradicate the scourge of terrorism. Finally, I cannot conclude without expressing my heartfelt sympathy for Mexico, which just yesterday experienced a new, deadly earthquake in Mexico City. On behalf of the country and the people of Madagascar and myself, I would like to express my solidarity, compassion and sincere condolences to the President, the people and the Government of Mexico, with special thoughts for those who have lost loved ones.",1,196
7812,Session 72 - 2017,MDV_72_2017.txt,MDV_72_2017,72,2017,MDV,"We stand today at a crossroads between old wars and new conflicts; between what we know and what we fear; between the needs of a changing planet and the demands of a growing population. We remain caught between human ambition and human limitations. In these times of change, we must turn once again to the principles that define the Organization â?? those that make us who we are and who we would like to become. Rising from the darkness of war, the United Nations shone like a beacon of light. Dedicated to seeking peace, the Organization became the purpose for many of those fighting for freedom, fighting fear and fighting for the right to be. The United Nations was and is the best hope we have for humankind. The United Nations was built on the promise of peace and salvation. It is a place where every issue can be debated for a solution and where every nation has a voice, regardless of its size or might. That is why we believe that the theme for this session of the General Assembly â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is most appropriate. This is what makes up the core of the Organization and what defines our work. Please allow me to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his assumption of the role of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also welcome the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, to his first general debate and commend him for the dedication he has demonstrated throughout his first year in office. The United Nations is what we all make of it. It is made up of us, the Member States, and its successes and its weaknesses are determined by how much we put into it. My country, the Maldives, envisions a United Nations that is fair and representative of its diverse membership, that takes into account the views and opinions of all, and that forms consensus based on compromise and dialogue. We envision a United Nations that commits and delivers. Our vision for a stronger United Nations is founded on President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoomâ??s policy of strengthening national resilience â?? economic resilience, social resilience, political resilience and, indeed, environmental resilience. It is based on crafting meaningful global solutions, built on national policies and experiences, to the common problems of our times and for our common and shared destiny. The world must become a safer planet for all. No man, no woman and certainly no child should suffer due to conflict, yet we know that this is not the case. Far too many people are dying in conflicts across the world. Far too many mothers are living in fear, unsure of the fate of their children, and far too many children are seeing their futures crumble in front of them. In Palestine, another year ends without permanent peace or permanent hope. An independent, sovereign State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, established along the 1967 borders, is the only solution and the only way. Yet, many resolutions have been adopted without action and many peace processes have been abandoned without progress. The shameful occupation by Israel continues, without any consequences. Violence, economic deprivation, fear, hunger and hopelessness â?? these are what a child in Palestine is born into. Generations have now matured knowing nothing else. That must end. In Syria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost their lives, with many millions displaced and many more millions made refugees. War crimes have been committed, chemical weapons used and inhumane treatment normalized. That suffering must end. As hundreds of innocent people continue to flee violence, conflict and endless suffering â?? in their greatest numbers since the world wars â?? it has become imperative that we seek sustainable, long-term solutions that address the well-being and welfare of migrants and refugees. Incidents of hatred, Islamaphobia and xenophobia, which have become so frequent today, can only breed more violence, intolerance and hatred. Our policies of fences, force and fear must end. In Myanmar, the situation of Rohingya Muslims, who are some of the most persecuted people in the world, presents another tragic case. Systemic violence, including massacres, the torching of homes, forced displacement and forced migration, are acts of ethnic cleansing that are alarming, to say the least. Those responsible for such barbaric actions must be brought to justice swiftly. Those acts of prejudice, violence and discrimination against Rohingya Muslims must end. Instilling fear of the other is easy. Determining others to be worthless owing to their religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, Islamaphobia or any other reason is a short step away. When that happens, it is easy to ignore grave violations; it is easier to even encourage them. It is then, and only then, that we see, as we have seen, the worst of humankind. We cannot allow another wave of genocide to recur â?? not on our watch. Chaos, vacuum and uncertainty have given the opportunity for Daâ??esh to start its own brand of terror, its own version of religion and its own brutal methods of fear. Combating terrorism and fighting violent extremism and radicalization are national priorities. We have enacted national legislation and formulated a comprehensive national policy in our fight against violent extremism. Last year, we also established a national centre for counter-terrorism. It is a top priority for the Maldives. The Maldives is working with its bilateral and international partners, studying best practices and forging common consensuses. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in achieving greater global coordination in the fight against terrorism. The establishment of the new United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, we hope, will inject more energy into the implementation of the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. The Secretary-General will have our full support. We must all do more. Today, we are in the midst of a war like no other. Our enemies have no single face, no single identity, no single country and no single strategy. The only things they have in common are their brutal methods and misplaced ideology. The fact that they kill more Muslims â?? the very people they allegedly fight to protect â?? proves their twisted reasoning. Such terrorism and such extremism must end. In North Korea, the most recent tests of ballistic missiles, and with them the real threat of nuclear weapons and war, have alarmed us all. They are a clear violation of international law and an unnecessary act of provocation. There is every possibility now that they could lead us down the path of destruction. We condemn those actions and urge North Korea to return to dialogue, let multilateralism take its course and choose peace over war. These blatant attempts at aggression must end. The world must become a more hopeful place for all â?? a place where people enjoy decent and meaningful lives. Adopting a proactive and constructive stand is our approach. Sustained and targeted investment is our policy. Looking to cultivate a culture of respect for human rights, at home and abroad, is our goal. We believe that we have been successful. The Gender Equality Act has guaranteed in law what Maldivians have been practicing for decades â?? equality for women at home, at work, in decision-making and in our society. Policies aimed at increasing the representation of women in leadership positions are showing results. Laws, policies and regulations have created a framework in which every man, every woman, every Maldivian can be a champion for gender equality. We need to do more, as all countries do, but we are proud of our considerable progress. People with disabilities are supported through financial and material support. Our elderly population is getting the compassion and financial support we owe it, through well-targeted policies. Universal health care has been realized across the country, in all 188 islands. Easy access to a medical doctor, sea ambulances and a pharmacy on every island are ensured. The Maldives spends more than 9 per cent of its gross domestic product on health-related expenses, which is the highest in the region of South-East Asia. It is an investment that has propelled us on our development path. Lymphatic filaria, measles, malaria and polio are all diseases that have been eradicated in the Maldives. Access to safe, habitable and affordable housing is recognized as a human right in the Constitution. Considerable progress has been made with several housing units built and awarded under public-housing schemes, despite the scarcity of land and the remoteness of islands. Achieving near-universal literacy and universal enrolment in schools has not stopped us. We are investing continually in improving the quality of our schools, our teachers, our curriculum and our approaches so as to ensure that no child is left behind. We are also investing in our young people â?? the future of our nation. Caring for the physical, mental and social well-being of our young people â?? the largest portion of our population â?? is a cornerstone of the Governmentâ??s policy. We are focused on creating an enabling environment in which they will thrive and shine, including through the promotion of unity, cultural values, national identity and national spirit through programmes such as Tharika, launched earlier this year. The Maldives is a middle-income country, but like every country we want to achieve higher growth and even greater development. If that is to happen, large-scale investment is necessary. Investments are a means to support not only our economic development but also our social development. Large-scale projects will help to provide economies of scale and facilitate the expansion of key sectors of the economy, as well as create jobs and opportunities for our youth so that their creativity can be unleashed. Yet it has become increasingly difficult for middle-income countries like the Maldives to access concessional financing for development projects, thereby leaving them no other choice than to accept commercial interest rates and further increase their debt burdens. That will undoubtedly make the transition from the middle-income category to higher levels of development all the more challenging. Our successes at home provide the basis for our solutions to the global problems that are facing our world. Our focus globally has been to ensure that we pay attention to the most vulnerable. That is why we believe that focusing on those who have no voice and are not usually represented and ensuring that their voices are heard should be the international communityâ??s collective focus, as it was ours during the six years we served on the Human Rights Council. Accordingly, while on the Council, we established the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council. Those two groups of countries are acutely underrepresented in Geneva. Our priority therefore was women, children and the disabled, and we initiated discussion on the link between climate change and its consequences on human rights. We worked hard to establish the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment â?? a major global milestone. The world must be made a happier place to live in, and that can be achieved only through our collective will to approach our shared problems with concrete solutions. There is no greater global threat than that posed by climate change. In 1987, when the Maldives first spoke about sea-level rise, the science was still new and the threat relatively unknown. We persisted in our advocacy because we believed that the threat of climate change deserved and, indeed, warranted global attention. The Maldives hosted the first Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise in 1989. We helped establish the Alliance of Small Island States â?? one of the most influential groups with regard to climate change and sustainable development â?? which we have chaired since 2015. In 2008, the Maldives introduced the first United Nations resolution on human rights and climate change (Human Rights Council resolution 7/23), which was the first time that a United Nations document acknowledged that link. Today, the threat of climate change is very real. Unpredictable weather, more frequent and intense natural disasters and unprecedented temperatures are the norm rather than the exception. The unprecedented frequency and the intensity of the recent hurricanes that struck the Caribbean, the United States and the Pacific islands last year are all powerful signs that our planet has changed significantly. Island nations, including the Maldives, are the first to be devastated by such impacts, but we are not the only ones. Today, climate change is becoming a reality for the rest of the world whether or not we choose to believe it. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere sympathies to those who were recently affected by Hurricanes JosÃ©, Irma and Maria. I assure them that we will not stop our advocacy with regard to the effects of climate change. We have proposed many solutions. The full implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is our priority. The reduction of harmful emissions, transitioning to renewable sources of energy and investing in mitigation and adaptation are all crucial. We need to join together in meaningful and durable partnerships to find sustainable solutions. We need constructive engagement, leadership â?? such as we are seeing from China, Brazil, India, Canada, France, Germany and countless others â?? and a certain degree of openness to change on the part of all countries, including developing and developed ones. At home, we are investing in renewable energy through the transition to a low-carbon economy. As the Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, and in collaboration with the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Maldives launched the initiative for renewable island energy, which will facilitate support for small island States in their transition to renewable energy and in achieving energy efficiency. We are looking at innovative approaches to fulfil the development needs of our people that do not compromise the needs of our planet. We have lent our voice and shared our experience. We have requested support to make our economy and our country more resilient to the shocks and impacts caused by climate change. Taking care of our ocean is intimately linked to taking meaningful action on climate change. The Maldives and other island nations are custodians of large expanses of ocean. Yet every person in this Hall, every community which they represent and every country they come from benefits from our oceans and depends on the health and wealth of our oceans and seas. Every other breath we take comes from the ocean. In the Maldives, the ocean is the backbone and the artery of its two main economic sectors: fishing and tourism. The ocean defines who the Maldivians are â?? traditional seafarers and members of fishing communities who rely on the produce that the ocean offers them. We therefore welcomed and actively participated in the first United Nations Oceans Conference, held earlier this year, and despite the hardships, we have preserved our traditional method of pole-and-line fishing, which is the best regarded, cleanest, greenest and most sustainable method of fishing, as it is predicated on catching fish individually with practically no by-catch. Since 2010, our entire exclusive economic zone, which comprises nearly 1 million square kilometres, has been declared a shark sanctuary. As the current Chair of the Save Our Sharks Coalition, we call on other countries to adopt that measure. Accordingly, an entire atoll is recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve, while many other marine resources and areas are protected and preserved. In fact, there are many more uninhabited islands with marine protected areas than populated islands in the Maldives. That is why the total ban on the exploitation of ecologically significant marine creatures â?? such as turtles, whales, dolphins, rays, and whale sharks â?? is strictly enforced. At the same time, Maldivians are some of the most prolific consumers of fish and marine products, thereby demonstrating to the world that the sustainable use of marine resources is indeed possible. We must not forget those who suffer the consequences of natural disasters. We are witnessing the total destruction and loss of life resulting from the earthquake in Mexico. As the international community, we must strive to do our very best for them and the many others throughout the world who are suffering from disasters, and focus on cultivating resilience through better rebuilding. Climate change, sustainable development, and the protection of our ocean are not trends or ephemeral infatuations. Inaction will cost us our progress, prosperity, the lives of our people and the future of all our nations. This is not the time to question what we already know. This is not the time to turn inwards or look the other way. There is no time to waste. It is time to act. Two days ago, we celebrated 52 proud years as a Member of the United Nations. Throughout our membership over the past five decades, we have worked with a vision of a United Nations that protects people, providing them with a safe haven and access to their rights; a United Nations that preserves our planet, prioritizing the needs of our present generation without compromising those of the future; a United Nations that promotes peace, a world free from fear and full of bright tomorrows and an abundance of hope. We have focused on providing meaningful, pragmatic and real solutions, based on sound national experience, for our common shared destiny. It is because we have a meaningful vision to promote that we continue to make every effort for the common cause of humankind. It is our firm belief in the power of multilateralism â?? the same faith that propelled us 52 years ago to seek membership of the United Nations, the very first foreign-policy decision of the independent Maldives â?? that pushes us to be effective members of the international community. It is because we have never served before; it is because of the promise of equality of representation and our conviction that every nation, large or small, should have a voice and can make a difference; and it is because of our firm conviction that size does not determine destiny or value that, for the first time in our 52 years of membership of the United Nations, we are seeking a seat on the Security Council for the 2019-2020 term. We stand tall and proud because we believe that we have much to offer: fresh perspectives, fresh ideas and new concepts that would bring renewed dynamism and new approaches to the United Nations. The Maldives deserves an equal chance to serve on that international organ. We are dedicated to the cause of peace in a sustainable world, and we are determined to leave a mark and make a difference. The triumph of multilateralism, the pinnacle of our common vision, lies in our collective approach to solving the global challenges of our time. The Maldives stands ready to take that leap of faith, providing shared solutions for our shared, common destiny.",1,196
7813,Session 72 - 2017,MEX_72_2017.txt,MEX_72_2017,72,2017,MEX,"I am addressing the General Assembly today at a difficult and painful time for Mexicans. Our nation has been battered by Nature. In recent weeks, together with our sister nations of the Caribbean and the states of Florida and Texas, in the United States, we have been hit by tremendous natural disasters that have resulted in suffering, destruction and death. The worst for Mexico was two consecutive earthquakes in only 12 days, which have put to the test not only our readiness and infrastructure but our very humanity. The first earthquake left approximately 100 people dead and 300,000 injured in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The second, just 48 hours ago, so far has caused 273 deaths and the destruction of many houses, schools and bridges. It has left many people wounded in Mexico City and in the central part of Mexico. In the face of these natural disasters, today more than ever I feel proud to be Mexican. Mexican society, united and in a spirit of solidarity, has taken to the streets to help and rescue the victims. We are seeing young people rescuing the old, children rescuing their parents, homemakers joining rescue brigades, neighbours collecting food, people opening their homes and turning them into shelters, and others forming human chains to clear debris and save the lives of those who are still trapped. It is with great hope that we inform the Assembly that we have been able to pull 51 people alive from collapsed buildings, and we hope to rescue many more. At this difficult time, Mexicans are very moved by the many speedy gestures of solidarity on the part of the international community. Friends are there at difficult times, and we have seen with great emotion that Mexico has true friends throughout the world. Their timely help can make the difference between life and death for many. So far, priority has been given to rescue activities, helping people trapped in the rubble to be able to see the light of day once again. We are also providing immediate medical assistance to those who need it urgently, and have joined together to feed and shelter all those who have lost their homes or are afraid to return to them. Leading these efforts is a society resolved to move forward stronger than ever. We have had vital help in assisting our people from our armed forces and civil protection authorities. The rescuers have not rested in this task, and yet much remains to be done. On behalf of the people and the Government of Mexico, and on behalf of the President of all Mexicans, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, let me wholeheartedly express my gratitude for the innumerable shows of sympathy and support that we have received from throughout the world. This help shows us that to be in the United Nations following a natural disaster means being among oneâ??s family. Today Mexico feels embraced and is relieved to see that the world has not abandoned us in our tragedy. We would in particular like to thank Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres and the staff of the United Nations system that help with emergency situations by supporting urgent assistance efforts. I should like also to thank the many countries that mobilized very quickly to send rescue teams and experts. This morning in Mexico City we woke up to the presence of rescue teams from Honduras and El Salvador, who were assigned to the Tlalpan area. Rescue teams from Israel were busy in Ã?lvaro ObregÃ³n street; from the United States, in Escocia and Edimburgo streets; and from Panama, in Queretaro and MedellÃ­n streets. Rescue teams have recently arrived from Spain, and in the next few hours we are expecting teams from Ecuador, Japan, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru and many other nations that have offered help, which we will definitely accept and avail ourselves of. We give heartfelt thanks to the Governments of those countries for their solidarity. The Mexican people will not forget it. The international solidarity that is on display in Mexico does not mean that we should not talk about the challenges facing the world, which can be overcome successfully only through that same solidarity. One of those challenges is the growing lack of confidence in multilateralism. In the past decade, the international economy experienced the impacts of a severe financial crisis in the more developed countries, which led to a sudden rise in unemployment, the loss of savings and a drop in the net worth of millions of families; many companies also went bankrupt. In addition, thousands of jobs are gradually disappearing owing to the growing use of robotics in certain industries and the automatization in the service industry. These factors have given rise to a wave of deep fear and social frustration, which have led to the rejection of an open world and of globalization. Terrorism has also contributed to increasing fears of the outside world among the peoples of various regions. This wave of fear and rejection of globalization has reached the United Nations and other international organizations. Today we hear voices questioning the effectiveness of multilateralism in dealing with global challenges. It would seem today that the community of sovereign States is dealing with a false dilemma: to persevere in cooperation and in building bridges of understanding or, on the contrary, to close borders and build walls based on fear. Mexico rejects that dilemma. Mexico has been, is and will remain a sovereign State with a deep multilateral vocation. No country, however powerful, is capable of responding on its own to the enormous shared challenges of our time. It is multilateralism that makes the difference between an international system of States that are limited to mutual coexistence and an international society in which sovereign States are committed to a joint and responsible coexistence for the solution of the common challenges. The commitment of States to multilateralism reduces anarchic tendencies in the international system. A world based on sovereignly accepted rules and procedures is in everyoneâ??s interest, because multilateralism sets acceptable international parameters within which sovereign States accept to maintain their conduct. The achievements of multilateralism in recent years are many. The fight against climate change, the preservation of biodiversity, the regulation of the arms trade, the new paradigm of international drug control policy and the response to natural disasters are some examples of that. Today, Mexico is betting once again on multilateralism in the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Today, as Mexico confronts a tragedy, Mexicans once again see the value of multilateralism through the support provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). We recognize the value of being part of an authentic international community. In minutes, OCHA helped us to identify the countries that had the capacities to support our emergency. In that moment of pain, multilateralism and the United Nations showed the Mexicans their most generous and practical face. Few instruments call for solidarity among human beings with the power of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For Mexico, the Agenda is a State commitment. In that regard, we established a national council, headed by the President of the Republic, and the Federal Government will prepare its budget and development plans based on the criteria contained in the Agenda. The 2030 Agenda should serve as a new focal point for the work of our Organization. We must channel the energies of the United Nations towards effectively seeking the prosperity of the people of the planet. Mexico will always be in favour of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Unfortunately, armed conflicts continue to demand the involvement of the United Nations. That is why Mexico has participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations since 2014. The successful case of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace is a significant example. However, if the United Nations is to be more effective in that task, it is necessary to strengthen its preventive capacities, focused on the individual, the promotion of development and, of course, respect for human rights. The existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to all humankind. In view of the persistence of the nuclear danger, the Government of Mexico signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons yesterday, which the executive will soon submit to the approval of the Senate of the Republic. At the same time, Mexico will support all Security Council resolutions against nuclear threats, and today we reiterate our full support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in order to ensure its effective compliance. We unequivocally condemn all terrorist attacks, regardless of their motivation. That is why we support the multilateral initiatives of the United Nations, which, together with the efforts to eradicate terrorism, promote tolerance and the respect for human rights. States have the obligation to protect and promote human rights. However, women and girls suffer sexual violence, exclusion, marginalization, discrimination and, in extreme cases, abominable murders. Mexico recognizes its obligation to redouble efforts to combat those practices and punish their perpetrators. States should be committed in solidarity to the empowerment of women and girls. Gender equality is a prerequisite for a world in which peace and development are truly sustainable, inclusive and lasting. Mexico reaffirms its openness to the world. We are expanding and diversifying our political, economic and cooperative links with all regions, including Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Mexico and the Union Europe are about to complete the updating of their legal framework, which will have stronger instruments, based on shared values, such as the defence of multilateralism, to better face the global challenges of today together. In the same way, we are strengthening our ties with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. We have launched trade negotiations with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Israel, to mention just a few. At the same time, we are determined to deepen our ties with the region to which we proudly belong, Latin America and the Caribbean. The natural disaster that Mexico experienced proves that solidarity is a critical value for the countries of our region. Mexico is standing and will continue to stand in solidarity with each and every one of the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean. We want to stand in solidarity with our brothers from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in their ongoing efforts to strengthen the security, stability and prosperity of their societies in the interest of increasing the safety and prosperity of their peoples. Mexico also wishes to stand in solidarity with our brothers of the Caribbean, who are facing a huge challenge in their reconstruction. Mexico has been and will continue to be present in that effort. We want to stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people, who are struggling to recover their democracy. We will maintain our solidarity with our partners of the Pacific Ocean Alliance â?? Chile, Colombia and Peru â?? in order to continue promoting innovation, trade and investment in our countries. We want to stand in solidarity with members of the Southern Common Market â?? Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay â?? with which the Pacific Ocean Alliance has started a promising process of rapprochement. We want to be in solidarity with our Cuban brothers, who aspire to open up to the world and normalize their relations with all nations. Mexico is also a proud member of North America. As a sovereign and solidary nation, we believe in the process of North American integration so that the region can consolidate itself as the most competitive in the world. Mexico aspires to and foresees a region where bridges of friendship and cooperation prevail, along with the principle of shared responsibility in facing our common problems. Today, the people and the Government of Mexico reiterate from this rostrum their deep solidarity with all Mexicans living in the United States, regardless of their immigration status. The Government of Mexico has the moral and legal obligation to protect and support them. Through our consulates, we will continue to support them, defend their rights and advocate for their causes. We are deeply proud of them and their contribution to the North American economy, culture and society. We are particularly proud of the â??dreamersâ?? and will continue to strive for a permanent solution to their legal status. With Canada and the United States, we are making progress in updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. We are participating in that process with absolute seriousness. Mexico will always defend its legitimate national interests in the conviction that it is possible to achieve a very positive result for all three countries. We know that the world is focused on the outcome of those negotiations. We have an opportunity to consolidate a more prosperous, more competitive and more just North America. In the present moment of pain, Mexicans see the value of a more supportive, efficient, effective, transparent and representative United Nations. The Government that I represent supports the proposals of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, because they are aimed at making the United Nations system a more effective and solidary Organization. The message that I bring today is that Mexico will overcome the recent catastrophe and our nation will be stronger for it. Mexicans are a strong people. The people and the Government of Mexico are still standing. Today, Mexicans thank the world and the United Nations. We thank the United Nations agencies for being aware of us. We thank Governments for their sympathy, support and extraordinarily valuable help. We thank all for their solidarity. We thank the citizens of the world who are thinking of us today. We thank them for their prayers and good wishes and for standing with Mexicans, today and always.",1,196
7814,Session 72 - 2017,MHL_72_2017.txt,MHL_72_2017,72,2017,MHL,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, I have the honour to convey warm greetings to the General Assembly. I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I am proud that his predecessor from the Pacific, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, will continue his service to the United Nations as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Ocean. I also extend the condolences of my Government for the destruction and tragic loss resulting from the recent disasters in Mexico, the United States, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba, Haiti, the Bahamas, Dominica and the territories of the United States and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, St. BarthÃ©lemy, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and other islands. The United Nations stands strong as the only place that all of us in the world have to confront our darkest challenges together. Even if the present moment appears uncertain, we must all remain confident and committed to ensuring that the Organization will speak for those who might not otherwise have their voices heard. Recent events with regard to North Korea and its growing nuclear threat must serve as a clear mandate for strong, urgent global cooperation and effective action. The Marshall Islands is a small island nation in the Pacific, and we wish only peace, security and stability for the world. We cannot ignore this sudden and obvious threat to the territory of Guam, our closest neighbour, friend and home to some of our citizens. The threat posed to Guam is a threat to the wider Pacific Islands region, and we express our concern about the challenges these actions have posed to peace, security and cooperation across the wider Pacific Rim. The highest levels of the Government of the Marshall Islands vociferously condemn the nuclear test of 3 September and related actions. There is no need for debate: these actions are clear violations of Security Council resolutions and seriously challenge the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime based on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I am appalled that the Marshall Islands, of all countries, is again facing the very real threat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean. The Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns these test efforts not just for its own security, but because we know the impacts first-hand. The 67 nuclear tests conducted in my country between 1946 and 1958 have produced a burdensome legacy that we hope no other nation or people will ever have to bear. These tests were conducted when my country was under the tutelage of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, which was charged with our welfare and well- being. When the Marshallese leaders travelled to New York to present two petitions to urgently halt nuclear tests in 1954 and 1956, the United Nations responded with Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV) and 1493 (XVII), which are the only times any United Nations organ has ever specifically authorized nuclear tests. The consequences of this ignorance were â?? and are â?? beyond horrific. Our people and environment have suffered as no other people should. The impacts of this legacy today remain stark and present challenges, passed from one generation to the next: from mother to daughter, father to son. This is why, in 2012, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste outlined the clear human rights implications and responsibilities which we affirm. I thank the Secretary-General for his statement to the Chair of the Pacific Island Forum on 14 August 2016, in which he said that â??finding a solution to this issue is critical for the future of the Republic of the Marshall Islandsâ??, assuring us that relevant United Nations entities stand ready to respond to requests for assistance. Recent events should be creating far greater political resolve to curb and ultimately eliminate global nuclear threats. In this regard, the Republic of the Marshall Islands supports those nations that are now able to accede to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in so doing, and we will continue to add our own voice in all forums, including in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and the Review and Extension Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We are committed to a closed and inclusive examination of our own participation in the Nuclear- Ban Treaty by listening closely to our stakeholders and affected citizens, taking into account any possible implications for our common security relations. It will always remain our fervent hope that such weapons of mass destruction shall never again be tested or unleashed upon the world and that all nuclear-armed nations will find the necessary political will to disarm. Earlier this year, my country experienced the tragic loss of our one-time Minister and climate ambassador, Mr. Tony de Brum, and I wish to express my gratitude to those who have conveyed their condolences. Ambassador de Brum once said that for the Marshall Islands, â??[w]e are suffering the result of climate change and of the nuclear legacy and we have had nothing to do with either... In either case, people have to choose to end this world, this universe. You can either do it slowly with climate change, or you can press a button and blow it up. And neither is justifiedâ??. Just across from the United Nations, in the East River, there sits Belmont Island. It is a small, raggedy little outcrop only 1 metre tall. This island in New York must now serve as a reminder for the worldâ??s diplomats that if they ever see it vanish beneath the rising sea, then they must also know that they have lost the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. Climate change is real, and no credible scientist could ever make it otherwise. But what we see with our own eyes, in our low-lying islands, reveals a real present and growing threat to our own survival and security as a nation and as a State Member of the United Nations. We welcome the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which stands as a truly robust, ambitious and long-term agreement. We must not allow our confidence in each other to be thrown off by road bumps in the short term. We urge the ratification of and full participation in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which is the legacy of the personal drive of the late Minister-in-Assistance to the President of the Marshall Islands, Mr. Mattlan Zackhras, who suddenly and tragically passed away last month. At the end of a long night of negotiations last year, the late Minister said that when the Amendment was adopted he would be proud to call on all Marshallese children because he knew that the Kigali Amendment could mean the difference between whether they would have a country â?? and a future â?? or not. We strongly support the leadership of our Pacific island neighbour, Fiji, as the incoming President of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we hope that in its care and with its leadership, the parties will adopt a strong set of rules. The Paris Agreement is only as strong as the political confidence that stands behind it. It is beyond imperative that, even in such early moments, committed nations start the challenging task of pushing ourselves to do even more. Even with our limited resources, the Marshall Islands is committed not only to implementing the Agreement, but also to exploring where our own action on energy can be strengthened. We must match our own ambitions with respect to emissions with stronger approaches and closer bilateral work. The Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly agrees with the widespread call from the large and growing chorus of our fellow Member States for a more effective and efficient United Nations. It is beyond necessary. We support the Secretary-General taking action under his own authority to continue to initiate practical but powerful efforts to reduce duplication and improve delivery. It is a question not only of the use 17-29813 11/28 of public funds, including our own, but also of all of us improving our ability to achieve our full potential and making clear progress in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We cannot do it alone, and we cannot do itwith an international architect that, however good its intentions, has frequently lost the focus needed to help us make the connections between international forums and our local communities. Before we engage in an impossible fight over resources, we must first examine the use of our resources already at hand. Our small in-country team often struggles with gaining access to seasoned international staff who can help us learn to navigate the system. The United Nations Development Programme Resident Coordinator for the Marshall Islands actually resides in another nation nearly 3,000 kilometres away. Our Resident Coordinator, who is fully dedicated to her mission, is also charged with being a coordinator for eight other remote island nations, one of which she is a resident of. We must re-examine the management decisions that led to such an outcome. Without stronger focus from the United Nations system, small island developing States could face serious barriers to their ability to implement the SDGs. The Ocean Conference on the implementation of SDG 14, which took place last June, stands as a watershed moment of political will. But the good words uttered in those forums too often fall short when it comes to making global and regional decisions on oceans and fisheries. The Pacific small island developing States have sounded the alarm on the state of the worldâ??s oceans, which everyone has heard, but perhaps the alarm is not loud enough. As parties to the narrow agreement and beyond, we in the Pacific have the potential to effect a profound change in the role of the market in order to dramatically strengthen our own economic trajectory and boost global food security along the way. The United Nations system itself must do far more to help us focus on these transformative opportunities. And even if some of our partners are still slow to rise with us, the marketplace is already leading the way. What the Pacific region is doing for tuna by ensuring our participation while promoting sustainable practices, we are also doing with the wider oceans. Increasingly our political partners will come to realize that our political support depends not just on the pressure they apply, but on how willing they are to follow our lead on sustainable oceans and fisheries issues. While it may be our own Pacific economic and environmental survival at stake, it is also a great incentive for the rest of the world to know that two thirds of our planetâ??s surface is no longer in peril. No one is to be left behind when it comes to the SDGs or to complying with the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, we should consider that the exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations and its related agencies has created major challenges for both the Government and the people of Taiwan in the pursuit of their fundamental right to participate. As is the case for my nation, Taiwan is an indispensable partner for the international community, including for our own receipt of humanitarian aid, medical assistance, disease prevention, environmental protection, anti-terrorism and transnational-crime prevention. Practical approaches could allow us to work through existing controversies in order to achieve the global benefits of universal participation, including in the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the World Health Organization. Security Council resolution 2758 (1971) has been misused to justify the people of Taiwanâ??s exclusion from the United Nations. As a result, we are missing an important opportunity to cooperate with a proactive contributor to peace and the common global good. The United Nations, I believe, can and must do better. In conclusion, these may be trying times, and the challenges of the world are severe, but it is in such adversity that true character is defined. And if an effective United Nations was ever truly needed, it is now. We must look outward to embrace the community of nations rather than look inward at our own self-interest to the detriment of others. Multilateral engagement must be our guiding light as we move towards a more effective and efficient United Nations.",1,196
7815,Session 72 - 2017,MKD_72_2017.txt,MKD_72_2017,72,2017,MKD,"It is an honour for me to address the Assembly and to share the Republic of Macedoniaâ??s positions on the most important issues on the United Nations agenda. I firmly believe that we share the common goal of world peace. I also believe that we share the same commitments to a decent life for all in a sustainable environment and, further, that we will find common solutions to our common challenges. Peace, commitment to a decent life, and joint solutions are the values that the Republic of Macedonia has relied on in overcoming a deep political crisis that had repercussions throughout our region. We are a small, diverse countryy. We have managed to overcome difficult challenges because we have united around common values. That is why today the Republic of Macedonia is again free, secure and stable. It is a friend to all its neighbours and is firmly oriented towards full integration into NATO and the European Union. As Head of the Delegation of the Republic of Macedonia, I want to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k of the Slovak Republic on his election to the prestigious position of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to express our full support to Secretary-General Guterres. We wish him great success in carrying out his comprehensive, ambitious and much-needed agenda to transform and adapt the United Nations to enable it to meet its demanding tasks and our common challenges, both existing and emerging. The United Nations must continue to do more and better to meet those challenges and stand the test of time. We must be vigilant and constant, but also seek to develop innovative and adaptable conflict prevention, sustainable development and management reform mechanisms, while building on the foundations enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and other core documents. The world is plagued by severe humanitarian crises, new and protracted old conflicts, the intensification of terrorist attacks and violent extremism, human rights abuses and increasing climate-change effects. Different in scope and weight, those challenges have become more complex. They require a wide-ranging response. While we have been able to mitigate the consequences for some, others remain unabated. Just a few weeks ago, we witnessed devastating natural disasters in the Gulf of Mexico and South Asia. That is a harsh reminder that our planet is changing, and we all have an obligation to do our best to mitigate and hopefully reverse the consequences. We can progress if we are united. The promotion and protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law must remain at the core of our action. Despite the fact that the United Nations has a robust human rights architecture, the current blatant human rights violations, widespread impunity and lack of accountability around the globe remind us that there is much to be done. Monstrous terrorist attacks have increased in number. Our actions must focus on preventing violent extremism and radicalization, as they are major factors for terrorist recruitment. The establishment of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, in which one of the priority areas is prevention, was a welcome step. For our part, we are also working on a national strategy for the prevention of violent extremism and radicalization. I am aware that there are differing approaches to those crucial issues, as we have divergent views among us. However, I would like to urge the international community not to focus on its differences, but rather on its primary responsibility to act robustly for the common good. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery continues to jeopardize global security. The implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) is key to minimizing the possible disastrous consequences for the generations to come. In that regard, let me underline that we are deeply alarmed by the continued unilateral actions of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which has been conducting nuclear tests and missile launches despite the repeated calls of the international community to fully comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We believe that the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is possible, and we therefore urge the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to immediately abandon its nuclear and missile programmes and to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Let me comment briefly on the main theme of the current session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. States must remain focused on the implementation of the new sustainable development agenda that we agreed on at the seventieth anniversary of our Organization. That remarkable undertaking laid the foundations for the future development framework. That had implications for many other important areas of common concern. Many vital issues affecting global prosperity are related to the implementation of that agenda. It is therefore important to continue to encourage and build new avenues of cooperation and new partnerships among us. That is central to the integration of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. Those are the fundamentals for development and a hopeful future, as well as for our peace, stability and security. At the national level, our efforts to transform agreed goals into practice are included in the new United Nations Development Assistance Framework programme, the 2016-2020 United Nations Partnership for Sustainable Development. Here I would like to mention to last yearâ??s important summit on the issue of large-scale movements of refugees and migrants. That is a global phenomenon with various causes and diverse implications. The United Nations adopted a comprehensive political declaration and pledged to intensify international cooperation, in particular among countries of origin or nationality, transit and destination. The Republic of Macedonia supports and is participating in the ongoing consultation processes on the two compacts dealing with refugees and migrants. We expect an outcome that will address all aspects of these global phenomena. Let me remind everyone that in the past couple of years, hundreds of thousands of migrants have transited through my country and the region. Even though that presented complex challenges, we managed to provide humanitarian assistance to the people in need. Since we have to adapt globally, we must also do our homework and act as responsible Governments in order to secure and provide a better future and prosperity for our people. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia affirms its dedication to fundamental democratic values, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights. We overcame a deep political and institutional crisis through our resolute stand in defence of those fundamentals. Our understanding is that democracy must be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up. Societies are better off when decision-making is comprehensive, inclusive and transparent. Public policies must work for citizensâ?? well-being. My Government has laid out an ambitious reform plan with short-, medium- and long-term measures. Our goal is to restore democracy, build professional and independent institutions and improve the standard of living for every citizen, and to expedite the integration of the Republic of Macedonia into the European Union and NATO. From the depths of a political crisis we have emerged stronger, and we have been able to contribute to regional stability and cooperation. Those who know Balkan history know that our region has not always been seen in a positive light. I strongly believe that we have a new chance to make a change, not just in perceptions but in substance. Over the past few months, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia has strongly promoted a new approach to its neighbours. We have demonstrated the capacity to overcome open issues. We have articulated our national interests and acted in pursuit of them. At the same time, we have been fully aware and respectful of the national interests of our neighbours. Our policy is based on solving issues through dialogue and cooperation. We hope that that approach will inspire others and stimulate a new approach to bilateral relations in our region. As a positive step forward, let me underscore our signing of a bilateral agreement on friendship, good-neighbourliness and cooperation with Bulgaria. That represents a joint success for the two countries. This session of the General Assembly represents the twenty-fifth year of our participation as an independent State. Next year, we will mark a quarter- century of our United Nations membership. However, that anniversary is also marked by the dispute over how my country should be referred to, which has unilateral consequences on our development and perspectives. The Interim Accord of 1995 laid the foundations for a normalization of relations between Macedonia and Greece. At present, the two countries are implementing confidence-building measures, and that is a very positive development. We have a fresh impetus to overcome the long-standing bilateral dispute. I would say that we have both made certain mistakes at various times, but the main goal now is to resolve the issue and close it. I firmly believe that we must seize the momentum, conduct discussions in good faith and resolve the issue for our shared future. We greatly value the continuing efforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, and the good offices that he provides to that end. I firmly believe that there is a way to overcome the problem that Greece has with our constitutional name. For a change, let us try to approach it from a positive point of view. Maintaining good neighbourly and friendly relations is a two-way street. We are committed to doing our job and expect the same of our neighbours. That message has already been clearly sent to our friends and partners. I would like to reaffirm it here, from the rostrum, where all of us have been recalling the purposes and principals of the Charter of the United Nations. The world can be a very noisy place, but the most important things can be very quiet. I believe that if we listen to our peoples, we can hear the world. In conclusion, I want to underline that the Republic of Macedonia remains a staunch supporter of multilateralism. We will continue to work with the United Nations and all Member States on jointly reinforcing world peace and security, promoting human rights, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and dealing with all the other issues that are crucial for the people we represent.",1,196
7816,Session 72 - 2017,MLI_72_2017.txt,MLI_72_2017,72,2017,MLI,"At the outset, on behalf of Mali, allow me to extend warm congratulations to the President on his election to guide the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also commend the outstanding work of his predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the Organization, my dear friend AntÃ³nio Guterres, for his leadership, vision and commitment to the common values, purposes and principles of the United Nations. Mali welcomes the choice of the theme of the present session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? which is both timely and relevant in a world that is confronted with the various challenges to peace, security and the considerable efforts needed to improve the living conditions of our populations. The highest priority of our joint efforts at present is not the effective preservation of our planet, which is of course in our best interests, but, more urgently, the interest of our future generations. Given those numerous challenges, from which no one â?? not even my country, Mali â?? has been spared, since assuming my post as head of State, I have consistently devoted myself to working to quickly bringing peace and security for my people to an acceptable level, in creating genuine conditions for a decent life for the benefit of the Malian people and in improving our living environment. Since my election in 2013, I have firmly dedicated myself to the search for a negotiated political solution to the internal dimension of the Malian crisis. After eight long months of intense and steadfast negotiations in Algiers â?? and, once again, I would like to say how much we appreciate the efforts of our Algerian brothers, especially those of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and we thank them for the welcome and the hospitality we received in that wonderful white city â?? the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali was concluded. Today Mali is pleased with the conditions that were thus created for its future. The principal merit of the Agreement would have certainly been to immediately restore confidence among the Malian parties â?? no more belligerence. With the implementation of the Agreement, the general situation of the country has significantly improved. I shall spare the Assembly the long list of the measures and concrete actions taken by the Government of Mali to implement the Agreement in strict accordance with the letter and the spirit of the commitments we have made. As an example, I would simply point out that, as of today, what we call in Mali the interim authorities and transitional colleges â?? two key elements of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation â?? are operational in the five regions of northern Mali. In the same vein, I am particularly pleased with the current efforts aimed at the definitive return of the Malian administration to Kidal. That fortunate prospect was made possible by the efforts of the Malians themselves, aided by international mediation and the support of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). At the same time, the Government, under my authority, is working to stabilize the security situation in the central regions of the country, which today are a source of great concern for us and the whole country. That particular situation has become acute and urgent after the Algiers talks, which is to say that there is a new front to be secured and pacified. Important measures have therefore been taken and are currently under way, with very encouraging results. Those results undoubtedly speak of the common will of Malian men and women to achieve peace, reconciliation and the re-establishment of genuine conditions for a good life together. We also owe those results to the multifaceted support of the men and women of the United Nations system in Mali. They have paid a high price to help us, otherwise maintaining peace would have been bloody. That is why I would like to commend the excellent work of the civilian and military staff of MINUSMA, who work under conditions that I know are difficult and often dangerous. From this rostrum, I would like to pay tribute to the memory of all of the victims, both civilian and military, Malian and foreign, who have fallen in the field of honour in Mali. There have been numerous obstacles to the implementation of the Agreement, which have resulted in long delays, procrastination and postponements â?? all of which have generated immense impatience in national opinion and among international community. I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the Security Council for the adoption of resolution 2364 (2017), which renewed the mandate of MINUSMA. In addition, I am particularly pleased by the adoption, on 5 September, of resolution 2374 (2017), which establishes the legal framework for a sanctions regime against perpetrators of acts impeding the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. Those two resolutions are aimed at the effective resolution of the types of difficulties underlying the implementation of the Agreement. They also reflect the steadfast determination of my Government to tirelessly continue in its political and institutional efforts for firmness and diligence in the processes related to the effectiveness of the Agreement. The deterioration of the security situation in Mali has had a negative impact on the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation. Insecurity in Mali and the Sahel is a source of great concern for my country and for our neighbours. The situation poses, in all respects, a real threat to international peace and security. It is marked by terrorism, violent extremism and other forms of organized transnational crime, including trafficking in drugs, weapons and people. The Sahel is swarming with organized-crime groups. They have access to substantial material, financial and logistical resources and pose serious challenges to the individual functioning institutions and organizations of all our States. They sow death through their criminal and asymmetrical attacks. Working to conquer areas only partially under our sovereignty, they find themselves free to maintain and spread their criminal activities, thereby seriously threatening the foundations, and even the very existence, of our States. No single country by itself would be able to confront those cross-border threats. That was the entire rationale behind the establishment of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) by Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Chad so as to confront together shared challenges related to the security and the development of our countries. From its founding, in February 2014, to the present, our organization â?? which I have the privilege of chairing in 2017 and 2018 â?? has made tremendous progress. In particular, it has put in place the force conjointe du G-5 Sahel to combat terrorism, transnational organized crime and the trafficking of migrants. Although the adoption of Security Council resolution 2359 (2017) was certainly an important step, we would have preferred it to have been adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, which would have ensured its predictable and sustainable funding, including through the United Nations, in accordance with the decision by the African Union Peace and Security Council of 13 April. The force represents the collective resolve of our States to work together to secure and develop the region that we share, with the support of our partners â?? whom I commend here for their constant support at our side. Today we are working tirelessly towards the effective operationalization and functioning of the force, with the very much appreciated support of friendly countries and partner organizations. The first operations of the force will, we hope, begin in October. I can assure the Assembly that those operations will be carried out in strict compliance with human rights and international humanitarian law. A civilian mechanism will be deployed within the force so as to monitor that issue, which is so important to us, because the success of the force depends on the full and continued support of our people. I would nevertheless like to draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to some of the challenges that characterize the operationalization and maintenance of the force. Among them, mobilizing comprehensive funding for the force figures prominently. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to invite all friendly countries and international partner organizations to the international contribution planning conference for the force to be held in Brussels in December. I would like to give my assurance that resources allocated to the force will be managed with total transparency. Moreover, we remain open to any support from our partners that can help ensure better management of the resources of the force conjointe. I would also like to add, for the benefit of the friendly countries and international organizations that are ready to help us, that the Joint Force is in the public interest of all. Although we are going through a transitional phase today, the battle that we are waging in the Sahel is akin to a dam. If that dam were to give, that would be a misfortune for the civilized world, which shares our values. Therefore, in areas that involve equipping battalions and reinforcing logistics resources, as well as communications, emergency medical evacuation and combating the use of improvised explosive devices, we need the worldâ??s help. Alongside security issues, the G-5 Sahel places high priority on issues involving development, the resilience of populations, governance and decent jobs for the youth of our countries, among others. I would like to call on members of the General Assembly and the international community to provide sustained support to the G-5 Sahel Priority Investment Programme. Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals remains a priority for Mali. In that context, in 2016, the Government adopted its strategic framework for economic recovery and sustainable development for the period from 2016 to 2018. Its overall goal is to promote inclusive and sustainable development, with the aim of reducing poverty and inequalities in a united and peaceful Mali, while building on the potential and capacity for resilience, with a view to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The macroeconomic framework of our country has improved, and numerous indicators show encouraging developments, including robust economic growth with an annual average of approximately 6 per cent, and a substantial improvement in the business environment. This was noted by the Arab Maghreb Union. In that context, Mali will hold the Invest in Mali Forum on 7 and 8 December in Bamako, and we invite friendly countries and international organizations to come and bet on Mali. As a Sahelian country with an agro-sylvo-pastoral system, Mali remains deeply concerned about climate change, which is one of the major challenges involving the survival and development of humankind. That is why I would like to reiterate Maliâ??s commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to which it is party. In that regard, the international community must remain committed to its implementation so as to preserve the ecosystem for present and future generations. The world continues to face numerous public health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and Ebola. While commending the progress made in the fight against those pandemics, we must strengthen international efforts so as to achieve the shared goal of eradicating those diseases. We must redouble our vigilance and efforts so as to implement, in particular, the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: On the Fast Track to Accelerating the Fight against HIV and to End the AIDS Epidemic by 2030, which we, the worldâ??s leaders, adopted in New York in June 2016. Concerning migration issues, Mali fully supports the ongoing process in the Organization aimed at the adoption in 2018 of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Together we must seek suitable solutions to the human tragedy taking place in the Mediterranean and the desert, which leaves no human conscience indifferent and leads to thousands of deaths, including those of women and children. That maritime cemetery represents a scandal for the twenty-first century, and it must stop. Mali is at one and the same time a country of origin, transit and destination for migrants. We therefore have established a national migration policy with a view to better overseeing the phenomenon. Mali has also established national mechanisms for better managing migration issues. I take this opportunity to commend the substantial contribution of the Malian diaspora to the economic, scientific, cultural and social development of Mali. The diaspora constitutes both our pride and our wealth. The Government and the people of Mali continue to pay close attention to the situation in Africa and the rest of the world. We are therefore concerned about the situation in Libya, which continues to have a negative impact on the Sahel region. We call on all Libyan stakeholders to encourage the search for peaceful solutions with a view to achieving a lasting settlement of the crisis. Mali pays equal attention to the ongoing situation in the Middle East, in particular as concerns the impasse in negotiations surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mali reaffirms its support for the brotherly Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle to regain their inalienable rights and calls for the resumption of negotiations aimed at a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security in a calm Middle East. Similarly, we are concerned about the unprecedented increase in terrorism, violent extremism and religious intolerance in the world. To contain those global threats, which spare no country, we need to strengthen international and regional cooperation, foster a fruitful, ongoing dialogue and combat the vulnerabilities that expose our communities to extremist ideology. Mali welcomes the successes around the world in the fight against terrorist organizations and urgently calls for more cooperation and coordination in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. The realities and demands of todayâ??s world require that we adapt global governance to current challenges. The revitalization of the General Assembly and the long-awaited reform of the Security Council are becoming increasingly necessary if we are to have a United Nations capable of responding effectively to the legitimate expectations of all nations. That has been said here today. Mali reaffirms its commitment to the African Common Position on the reform of the Security Council. Moreover, we express our concern about the current tendency to reduce the budget of peacekeeping operations at the very time when such operations have become crucial and substantial in terms of volume. I wish to reiterate the Government of Maliâ??s call for the necessary adaptation of peacekeeping operations to the dizzying developments surrounding them: global threats. We believe that the call we just launched for support for our common regional organization, the G-5 Sahel, must be promoted so that we may receive energetic support for the G-5 Sahel and establish the effective business and financing that we lack. Unfortunately, very often such promises remain mere pronouncements, at the very time such operations are indispensable and urgent for the well-being of the populations under permanent threat from diverse groups infesting the region. Let me also say that today that our region is concerned about the trend in United Nations budgetary cutbacks. Each of us has been somewhat reassured today by strong statements made. We have a collective responsibility to bring about peace and to ensure security worldwide. We have the collective responsibility to leave no one behind and to create the conditions for inclusive development for our populations. We have the collective responsibility to save and to preserve our environment and our common planet. Through my voice, Mali fully commits to play its role in this collective endeavour to build a better world for all.",1,196
7817,Session 72 - 2017,MLT_72_2017.txt,MLT_72_2017,72,2017,MLT,"There can be no peace while poverty, especially extreme poverty, exists. Peace is not just about the absence of war or conflict. Rather, is is about managing and addressing climate change, migration and food and water insecurity. The instrument of the United Nations that weaves sustainable peace together with universal challenges is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In that regard, Malta, as President of the Council of the European Union, has worked hard with its other member States to achieve a successful march towards a new European consensus on development that encompasses the 2030 Agenda through a resolute plan of action to eradicate poverty. Never has it been more urgent to work to preserve the future of humankind. The 2030 Agenda is the first step towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Every sector of society must be on board if we are to deliver on such an arduous task. As the Commonwealthâ??s Chair-in-Office, I would like to highlight its strong commitment to its role in realizing the SDGs. The Commonwealth represents 52 different realities, which has led us to launch, in broad terms, a number of common initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Malta is taking action at the national level. We have made a voluntary commitment to designating 30 per cent of all waters under Maltese jurisdiction as marine protected areas. As is well known, Malta has been at the forefront of international maritime and marine-related issues. Fifty years ago, Maltaâ??s first Permanent Representative to the United Nations, the late Arvid Pardo, made a famous speech that triggered the negotiation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is in a similar spirit that we support the valuable work being done to achieve a legally binding international instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, which will be crucial to finally bringing legal protection to the biodiversity of the high seas. For our part, we will continue contributing to the good governance of the oceans by hosting the next Ocean Conference in Malta in October. Furthermore, we fully support the establishment of an intergovernmental panel on ocean governance that would report to the General Assembly through the Secretary-General. I also wish to underline the recent initiative undertaken by the Commonwealth to develop a â??blue charterâ??, which will serve to assist the countries of the Commonwealth, most of them small developing States, in meeting the requirements outlined in SDG 14. Likewise, we wholeheartedly welcome the November 2016 entry into force of the Paris Agreement. It is only by greening our actions that we can ensure that sustainable development complements and respects Mother Earth. Malta, together with all of its partners in the European Union, is strongly committed to the Paris Agreement. As a Government, we base our policies on four overarching principles: social mobility, social justice, equality and unity. Only today did we learn that, for another year in a row, fewer people in Malta are at risk of poverty. That follows our Governmentâ??s efforts to distribute the proceeds that come from sustained growth fairly. That is an achievement that is as dear to us as our record-setting economic growth and minimal levels of unemployment. It is exactly what we strive for. Our raison dâ??Ãªtre is what we describe as prosperity with a purpose. A prosperous future must be accompanied by an inclusive society. People who live in fear or who are oppressed or discriminated against cannot realize their potential, and are therefore not at peace. Malta seeks to lead by example and ensure equality as a hallmark of our political legacy. We have put human rights, equality and empowerment at the forefront of our political agenda, particularly on the priority issues of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer rights and gender equality. We have redefined marriage to grant full equality and affirm gender neutral access. All this has been complemented by amendments to our constitution to protect people against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. These individual choices should really have as little significance as the colour of oneâ??s eyes. The economic and political empowerment of our citizens, regardless of their gender, is a priority for us. We have been gradually introducing measures to help reconcile work and family responsibilities. We are proud to be the only European country providing universal free child care to all working parents, an initiative that has liberated the potential of so many women in our society. We want to ensure more gender- balanced political representation, coupled with recent initiatives to increase youth participation by lowering the voting age in general and in European elections from 18 to 16 years of age, after having already lowered it for local elections. Malta, despite its small size, can now serve as a beacon of political courage that inspires others to introduce concrete measures and reforms. Everyone must feel empowered in todayâ??s society. The protection of marginalized and vulnerable people is a must if we are to strive for an inclusive world. The United Nations is pivotal in all this. It must continue to spearhead, sustain and mobilize the international community as we journey along the ambitious path to 2030. But so much more must be done. The exploitation of human misery knows no boundaries. Migrant smuggling and human trafficking by criminal groups are prevalent all over the world, and Malta has witnessed much of that very close to home, along the central Mediterranean routes. As a State member of the European Union, Malta is part of a wider European response aimed at tackling human-trafficking networks in the Mediterranean Sea. However, without a global response, national and even regional action is insufficient. Malta welcomes the progress that has been made in developing a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. That should reaffirm the sovereign right of States to decide their immigration policies, but it should also commit them to building a migration system and institutions that operate in a timely manner so that migrants are treated fairly and with dignity. It should protect migrantsâ?? human rights and create awareness of the importance of combating exploitation and modern slavery. It should lead campaigns against xenophobia while providing support for the integration of long- term migrants and taking account of the feelings of people in host countries. It is also our belief that although the global compact should encompass all of these measures, it should also facilitate orderly, safe and regular migration, while committing States, particularly those of origin and transit, to taking action to reduce illegal and unmanaged flows. Challenging times require us to act swiftly to meet such challenges. And that time is now. It is sooner rather than later. Systematic action by stakeholders at all levels and across all strata is crucial if its benefits are to be felt by people in every corner of the world. The United Nations is the prime mobilizer and anchor of international peace, security and stability and has a crucial role to play if we are to secure a peaceful, sustainable and better world for all. Malta is a firm believer in the overarching power of multilateralism. We do not believe that the United Nations is simply a sum of its parts. Rather, it is a force that grows exponentially when we think and act as one rather than alone.",1,196
7818,Session 72 - 2017,MMR_72_2017.txt,MMR_72_2017,72,2017,MMR,"I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We are confident that under your able leadership, this yearâ??s session will be fruitful. Before I go into the substance of my statement, I would like to take the opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the Government and the people of Mexico for the loss of life and property caused by the deadly earthquake that hit Mexico City. I also wish to convey our profound sympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the United States and States of the Caribbean, which have experienced the horrendous consequences of consecutive hurricanes in a short span of two weeks. Our sympathies also go to the people of Puerto Rico, who are still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Maria. The intensity and frequency of such natural disasters are evidence of climate change, now becoming a reality that poses a serious threat to our planet. Its impacts are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Myanmar is highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change, so as a country frequently affected by storms, floods and droughts we welcome the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that yesterday Myanmar deposited with the Secretary-General its instruments of ratification of the Paris Agreement and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. We welcome the current sessionâ??s theme, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Peace and stability are something that we are striving to achieve in Myanmar after nearly seven decades of civil strife and conflict. Last year, from this rostrum, our State Counsellor, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, set out our Governmentâ??s vision for ending decades of internal armed conflict in Myanmar and finding lasting and meaningful solutions to the complex situation in Rakhine state (see A/71/PV.11). Today, one year later, I am here to apprise the Assembly of the progress that we have made and the remaining challenges that lie before us. Given that the situation in Rakhine state has understandably been the focus of the worldâ??s attention in recent weeks, let me start by addressing that issue. Yesterday, the State Counsellor briefed the diplomatic corps in Myanmar on the Governmentâ??s efforts to promote national reconciliation and peace. She highlighted the achievements of the past 18 months and the challenges that remain. With respect to the situation in Rakhine, she said that Myanmar shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering experienced by all communities affected by the latest round of terrorist attacks. She also stressed that: â??We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence. We are committed to the restoration of peace, stability and the rule of law throughout Rakhine state. The security forces have been instructed to adhere strictly to the code of conduct in carrying out security operations, to exercise all due restraint and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians. Human rights violations and all other acts that impair stability and harmony and undermine the rule of law will be addressed in accordance with strict norms of justice. We feel deeply for the suffering of all of the people who have been caught up in the conflict.â?? The situation in Rakhine has been one of the top priorities of the Government since it assumed office. The Government has been endeavouring to restore peace and stability and to promote harmony among all communities. The Central Committee on the Implementation of Peace, Stability and Development of Rakhine State, chaired by the State Counsellor herself, was established on 30 May 2016 to address that stateâ??s specific needs. Additionally, in August 2016, she set up an advisory commission, headed by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to advise the Government on sustainable solutions to the complex situation there. We have been striving to ensure that Rakhine state is duly developed while ensuring peace, stability and societal cohesion. That is no easy task. The deep mistrust that has developed over decades has to be slowly chiselled away. On 24 August, the Annan Advisory Commission released its final report. Our Government welcomed it immediately. We had hoped that today would be an opportunity for us to communicate to the world the progress that we have made towards implementing the Advisory Commissionâ??s recommendations. It is, therefore, with deep regret that I must instead primarily address the Assembly on the current state of affairs in Rakhine state following the recent attacks by the terrorist group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) last month. As the General Assembly is aware, within hours of the release of the Advisory Commissionâ??s report, a series of coordinated attacks were carried out against 30 police outposts in northern Rakhine. The ARSA claimed responsibility for the attacks. Those attacks ignited fresh violence in the region, resulting in significant loss of life, widespread suffering and the mass displacement of many communities. Many have had to abandon their hearths and homes â?? not just Muslim and Rakhine, but also other small minority groups, such as Daing-net, Mro, Thet, Mramagyi and Hindus. Most of the world has been oblivious to their existence and plight. Let me be clear. The Government of Myanmar is extremely concerned about the present situation in Rakhine state. Our deepest sympathy goes to the families of all innocent civilians and members of the police and security forces who have lost their lives. There is no denying that this is a problem of significant magnitude. I am happy to inform the Assembly that the situation has improved. No armed clashes have been reported since 5 September. Accordingly, we are concerned about reports that the flow of Muslims crossing into Bangladesh remains unabated. We would need to find out the reason for that exodus. What is known is that the great majority of the Muslim population have decided to remain in their villages. We share the need to ensure that vital humanitarian assistance is provided to all those in need. Moreover, we acknowledge that the duty to respond to the challenges in Rakhine state is first and foremost the duty of our national Government. The situation in Rakhine is complex. The challenges we face are significant. Accordingly, we have adopted an integrated national strategy to address the problem. I am pleased to announce the launch of a committee chaired by the Union Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission. To ensure transparency and accountability, the committee is mandated to publicly issue a progress report every four months. In addition to the committee, we intend to establish an advisory board made up of eminent persons from both Myanmar and abroad. At present, humanitarian assistance is our first priority. We are committed to ensuring that aid is received by all those in need, without discrimination. We have already dedicated significant national funds and resources to humanitarian relief operations. I am also pleased to inform the Assembly that a new Government-led mechanism, established in cooperation with the Red Cross Movement, has also started its humanitarian assistance activities. On behalf of the Government of Myanmar, I would like to express my gratitude to all those countries that have offered to contribute to that assistance programme. In particular, we are grateful for the generous offers of support that we have received recently from many of our friends across the world. At the same time, we are working hard to strengthen relations with Bangladesh. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and the National Security Advisor visited Bangladesh in January and July. We were hoping for a visit from the Home Affairs Minister of Bangladesh, but it had to be postponed, as the Minister could not come in August. We will welcome him whenever he is able to come and hope to take forward our cooperation on border security matters. There has been a call for the repatriation of the displaced people who have recently fled from northern Rakhine to Bangladesh. In her statement yesterday, the State Counsellor said that Myanmar was prepared to start the verification process at any time. Our two neighbours had experience with such a process in 1993, through the establishment of a joint working group for implementing the repatriation process, and we can develop a process based on that experience. Myanmar stands together with the rest of the world in condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and our position is clear. We cannot condone terrorism. At the same time, the Government is working to ensure that acts of terrorism will not distract us from pursuing the long-term strategy that is necessary in order to address the complex challenges in Rakhine state today. The recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine state provide us with a clear road map. Our implementation committee began its work last week, and we will be inviting observers to witness some of our programmes in due course. The recent events in Rakhine state are a painful reminder that we face difficult challenges ahead on the long journey to peace, prosperity and democracy. However, I would like to reiterate that our commitment to peace remains as strong and as unwavering today as it was a year ago, when our State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, first addressed the General Assembly from this rostrum. As part of that commitment, we have made the national reconciliation and peace process our top priority. Our vision here is clear â?? we want to achieve a democratic, federal union, based on the principles of freedom, justice, equal rights and self-determination. With regard to the peace process in Myanmar, I am pleased to inform you that in May we successfully held the second session of our Union Peace Conference. For the first time, we were able to discuss and define key principles that will form the basis of a federal, democratic Union. The Union Accord, consisting of 37 principles covering the political, economic, social and environmental sectors, was signed by representatives of the Government, the Parliament, the military, ethnic armed organizations and political parties. Although we have made real progress, we know that the road ahead is long and convoluted. Our democratic transition is fragile. At this important juncture in our nationâ??s history, we only ask that the international community continue to support our efforts to achieve peace, prosperity and democracy. I would like to conclude by reaffirming Myanmarâ??s faith and confidence in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I would also like to emphasize our firm commitment to a world in which peace and harmony prevails.",1,196
7819,Session 72 - 2017,MNE_72_2017.txt,MNE_72_2017,72,2017,MNE,"It is my pleasure to address the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to reiterate Montenegroâ??s strong commitment to the values of the United Nations. As one of the newest Members of the Organization, Montenegro actively contributes to maintaining peace and security in its region. Good-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are at the top our foreign-policy agenda. We are strongly committed to multilateral cooperation and affirm our support for international organizations that contribute to peace and stability. It is of great importance for Montenegro that it has become the twenty-ninth member of the North Atlantic Alliance. As a member of the Alliance, my country will continue to improve its cooperation and partnership with United Nations peacekeeping operations and with regional organizations dedicated to establishing and maintaining peace and stability. At the same time, Montenegro has proved to be a reliable partner of the European Union. Accession negotiations have already ensured significant economic benefits. The international community is facing complex challenges such as long-term conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, refugee crises, the systematic violation of human rights, and poverty. The United Nations, which was established to prevent war and human suffering, should adjust more quickly in response to those challenges and adopt new mechanisms to prevent conflicts and resolve long-term crises. The United Nations and international and regional economic organizations have new responsibilities today. Peace, stability, achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and improving international economic relations are the basic elements for achieving the goals set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is therefore of great importance to carry out the successful implementation of the process of reforming the United Nations â?? and its affiliates the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank â?? in order to achieve more equitable economic growth, poverty eradication and womenâ??s economic empowerment, as well as to bridge the technological gap between countries and regions. Montenegro remains dedicated to United Nations efforts aimed at implementing the ambitious reform agenda, including the strengthening of the role of the General Assembly and the enlargement of the Security Council, in accordance with the principles of equitable regional representation. Successful cooperation between Montenegro and the United Nations system continues in the framework of the Delivering as One initiative. Positive results of this programme are visible and recognized by many States Members of the United Nations. Montenegro is part of a region whose experience has shown that dialogue and cooperation are possible and that they are the only way to overcome differences and achieve peace and lasting solutions to problems. Accordingly, early next year, we will organize a regional conference with a view to sharing our experience and helping to define new mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. Efforts aimed at preventing terrorism must be focused on its causes. That is the particular responsibility of the countries from which the terrorist threats emerge, but the international community should also offer needed help. We therefore highly appreciate the establishment, upon the initiative of the Secretary- General, of the Office of Counter-Terrorism, which will enable strong leadership and a connection between the United Nations and its Members as they strive to prevent conflicts and terrorism. Montenegro unequivocally supports the efforts aimed at the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons provides a foundation for the improvement of global stability. Montenegro has defined its national framework in this area by adopting a strategy of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for the period 2016 to 2020, including an action plan for its implementation. Montenegro strongly condemns the nuclear-weapon tests conducted by North Korea as acts that violate international obligations pursuant to Security Council resolutions. Those tests pose a serious threat to global peace and security. We support diplomatic efforts aimed at calming the current situation and call on North Korea to fully respect its international obligations. Highly important multilateral agreements that have been adopted confirm that multilateralism is crucial and essential for achieving peace, inclusive sustainable growth and respect for human rights. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Climate Agreement constitute a universal platform for transformation and progress. For their full implementation to be achieved, therefore, it is necessary to secure the utmost commitment of all Member States, as well as considerable financial resources. Montenegro strongly supported the negotiations on a new international accord on climate change. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a foundation for further efforts in long-term climate preservation. I had the pleasure and honour to participate, on behalf of Montenegro, in the historic Conference in Paris, when the Agreement was adopted, and to take part in its signing ceremony at Headquarters. As part of the efforts to mitigate climate change, Montenegro financially contributes to the Trust Fund of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Respect for human rights is a precondition for peace, stability and development. The full implementation of the international standards and norms relating to the promotion and protection of human rights is an obligation for every country. We are committed to the multilateral system for the protection and promotion of human rights, in particular among the most vulnerable groups, and therefore attach special importance to poverty eradication and the fight against discrimination. We also attach special importance to strengthening the position and role of women in society, the prevention of violence against women, child protection and development and the fight against discrimination of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex population and individuals with disabilities. We especially appreciate the joint initiative of the European Union and the United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls and the launch of the global alliance to end trade in tools of torture and capital punishment. I am certain that its improvement of human rights protection and respect for individuals renders Montenegro a strong candidate for membership of the Human Rights Council for the period 2022-2024. That was also confirmed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who said that Montenegro was one of 33 United Nations Members to send regular reports on the implementation of international agreements concerning human rights. We attach special importance to developing key documents on refugees and migrants and point out the necessity of a comprehensive approach, while taking into account the development, humanitarian, security and human rights dimensions. Based on our experience and in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we are ready to make a concrete contribution to drafting two global compacts. Its enormous obligation to offer humanitarian assistance to civilians in conflicts and natural disasters obliges the United Nations to reinforce mechanisms for humanitarian aid. Montenegro actively participated in the first World Humanitarian Summit, held last year. The Summit confirmed the need for efficient coordination of international humanitarian assistance. Montenegro has therefore invested significant efforts this year into ensuring that there are appropriate legislative and strategic frameworks for planning in place for managing and financing international development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. Finally, on behalf of Montenegro and on my own behalf, allow me to extend our congratulations to Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. His persistent commitment to dialogue and cooperation unequivocally confirms that he will be very successful in his high office. I would also like to express great appreciation to the former President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his achievements in the work related to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I take this opportunity to reiterate my most sincere congratulations to new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres. I am convinced that his rich professional experience, leadership and commitment will contribute to the work and results of the United Nations at this time when the world faces complex challenges. I also express my sincere gratitude to former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his overall contribution to achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as well as for his support for Montenegro. I wish the General Assembly a successful seventy-second session.",1,196
7820,Session 72 - 2017,MNG_72_2017.txt,MNG_72_2017,72,2017,MNG,"At the outset, I join previous speakers in expressing our solidarity and sympathy with the Government of Mexico and its people and with the Caribbean countries and the United States, which have all been hit by devastating natural disasters in the past few days. Natural disasters across the globe have become more frequent, and their consequences even more catastrophic. By some calculations, their numbers have quadrupled worldwide since 1970. The need for better national and local readiness, and for stronger regional and international cooperation, is growing. As part of those efforts, Mongolia will host an Asian ministerial conference in July 2018 aimed at implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction more effectively. Mongolia has been exposed to multiple environmental challenges as a result of climate change, including desertification, drought, land degradation and wild forest fires. The main goals of the Government action plan for the period 2016 to 2020 are therefore preserving a balanced ecosystem, protecting natural resources and ensuring their appropriate use and rehabilitation, and promoting green economic growth. All of us, developed and developing nations alike, are committed to working together to address newly emerging issues induced by climate change. For its part, Mongolia has developed its intended nationally determined contribution and will work to implement its target of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 14 per cent by 2030. The theme of this yearâ??s general debate, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, captures the main thrust of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. If the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are implemented, they will transform our world. But as important as the SDGs are, we should not overlook the compelling need to fine-tune the overall structure for their implementation at the national, regional and global levels. An important step in that direction was taken at the July meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. Mongolia fully supports the Forumâ??s declaration, which emphasizes the importance of fostering peaceful, just and inclusive societies as well as empowering vulnerable people through collective action. My country was one of the first to adopt the SDGs. In February 2016, our Parliament approved Mongoliaâ??s sustainable development agenda for 2030. It envisages Mongolia becoming an upper- middle-income country by 2030, eradicating poverty in all its forms while preserving an ecological balance and strengthening democratic governance. In parallel with the 17 SDGs, Mongoliaâ??s Vision 2030 integrates the three pillars of development â?? economic, social and environmental. We have mainstreamed its goals into our Government action plan for 2016 to 2020 and other relevant programmes. Among global development priorities, the special needs of landlocked developing countries are a top priority for Mongolia. According to World Trade Organization (WTO) estimates, landlocked developing countriesâ?? trade costs amount to applying a 260 per cent tariff to international trade, and the Office of the High Representative has concluded that on average, such countriesâ?? development is 20 per cent lower than it would be if they were not landlocked. Mongolia is committed to the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, along with other landlocked developing countries. It is gratifying to note that, with 10 required ratifications already in place, the multilateral agreement establishing an international think tank for countries such as ours will enter into force on 6 October. The Ulaanbaatar-based international think tank has already begun its research activities, thanks to the financial contributions of the Mongolian Government and other partners. Once fully operational, it will further support landlocked developing countries in their implementation of both the Vienna Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Enhancing connectivity is an urgent priority that all landlocked developing economies share. Mongolia acceded to the WTOâ??s Trade Facilitation Agreement in 2016. We value the potential of its article 11, on freedom of transit for reducing trade costs and boosting trade for landlocked developing countries, which can help us integrate into global value chains and make the transition from landlocked to land-linked status. In order to further improve market access to its main trading partners, Mongolia is studying the feasibility of free trade agreements with the Eurasian Economic Union, the Peopleâ??s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. An economic partnership agreement is already in place with Japan. In order to enhance regional integration in our immediate region of North-East Asia, Mongolia is actively engaged with its neighbours on transit, transportation and infrastructure development. In July 2015, the Presidents of Mongolia, China and Russia signed an agreement to develop a programme on the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor. It will focus on the implementation of joint projects to increase trade turnover, ensure competitiveness in goods supply, facilitate cross-border transportation and develop infrastructure. In August, we agreed on our priority projects, and we are in the process of setting up mechanisms to coordinate the actual implementation of the economic corridor. In December 2016, China, Mongolia and the Russian Federation signed an intergovernmental agreement on international road transport along the Asian highway network, marking another major step in trilateral cooperation. Mongolia is keen to work together with our two neighbours and other partners to improve rail, road, air and energy networks and pipeline infrastructure, and to increase access to the sea. Mongoliaâ??s State energy policy, adopted in 2015, set the ambitious goal of producing 30 per cent of its energy demands through renewable resources by 2030. Our solar and wind resources are estimated at 7,000 and 5,000 terawatts, respectively. With those resources, Mongolia has basically an unlimited potential for exporting clean energy to countries in our region. We are working with our partners to implement the Gobi Tech and Asian Super Grid projects to supply renewable energy to North-East Asia. They offer countries in the region a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits, including energy security, job creation and the reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions. We look forward to working with bilateral and multilateral partners on those important projects. When the global community set out on the collective journey towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it pledged to leave no one behind. The SDGs have made the reduction of inequalities among people â?? including the disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalized â?? a clear priority for the international community. Sustainable social development is a prominent part of Mongoliaâ??s Vision 2030 for the SDGs. It sets out goals aimed at ensuring gender equality, improving the quality of health-care services and access to them, creating safe, healthy living conditions for its citizens, providing everyone with a high-quality education, ending all forms of poverty and enlarging the middle-income class. But while we cannot achieve the timely and effective implementation of the sustainable development agenda without peace and security, peace is being threatened on a number of fronts. Mongolia is deeply concerned about the escalating tension in North-East Asia. We strongly oppose the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s destabilization of regional security by conducting repeated nuclear tests and launching ballistic missiles in defiance of the international communityâ??s will and in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. As a country that has had nuclear-weapon-free-zone status for the past 25 years, Mongolia reiterates its principled position that the Korean peninsula should be free of nuclear weapons, and we urge the parties concerned to refrain from any action that could heighten tensions in North-East Asia and to work to resolve the issue through peaceful means. In our view, the only way to do so is through dialogue. One possible avenue for that could be the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, which we initiated in 2013. We held its fourth International Conference in Ulaanbaatar in June. The Dialogue discusses not only security issues in North- East Asia but also potential energy and environmental projects, and as such is an open mechanism that can embrace the participation of every country in North- East Asia. The current tensions have only deepened the concerns we all have about nuclear weapons. Mongolia welcomed the Assemblyâ??s adoption, on 7 July, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. So long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use will persist. The only guarantee of the non-use of nuclear weapons is their total elimination. Pending the achievement of that ultimate goal, it will be critical to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as soon as possible, as well as vigorous implementation of the Action Plan agreed in the final document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We must also put an end to the protracted stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament. Terrorism continues to pose a grave threat to international peace and security, and terrorist activities around the globe remain unabated. We commend the Secretary-Generalâ??s establishment of a new United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism to provide strategic leadership for global counter-terrorism efforts. In the twenty-first century, it is disheartening to see the world facing the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. An unprecedented number of people, including the Rohingya Muslims, have been forced to flee their homes. The horror of the human tragedy that has unfolded during such forced displacements must stop. The current humanitarian emergencies require comprehensive responses that should include three elements â?? ensuring dignity for refugees, supporting host countries and addressing the root causes of the problem. It is the shared responsibility of all of us to promote the safe movement of persons and to respect international refugee law, human rights law and humanitarian law. Similarly, large movements of migrants require equally close attention. We look forward to the adoption of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in 2018. We hope it will be a critical tool for protecting the safety and human rights of all migrants, regardless of their migratory status, and for strengthening global governance on international migration. Today the role of United Nations peacekeeping is growing tremendously. Mongolia is proud to be contributing to its support for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In the past decade, Mongolia has dispatched more than 15,000 Blue Helmets to a number of hotspots and is currently one of the 30 largest troop- and police-contributing countries in the world. Mongolian peacekeepers are known for their dedication, skills and community- friendly behaviour in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. We intend to further enhance our contribution by providing engineering and special units to United Nations peacekeeping operations. As a member of the Human Rights Council, we reaffirm our firm commitment to eradicating the death penalty, torture and other kinds of inhumane and degrading treatment. Four days ago, together with Argentina and the European Union, we hosted a high- level event to launch the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade, a global alliance to end trade in products used to carry out torture and capital punishment. Strengthening democratic and open societies governed by the rule of law is a long-standing priority for Mongolia. Accountable institutions, access to justice for everyone and the significant reduction of corruption are all key ingredients of sustainable development as envisaged in SDG 16. At a time when the world is facing myriad global challenges, it is unsettling to have multilateralism questioned. In our globalized world, no State can tackle todayâ??s challenges alone. Global issues require global solutions. As a guarantor of security for all nations, large and small, the United Nations is a centre of multilateralism, but we must enhance its role as a centre of effective multilateralism. We commend the Secretary-Generalâ??s vision of the United Nations as an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace, and his recent establishment of the High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation could not be more timely. Its 18 eminent members bring to it an unparalleled spectrum of skills and, most important, the credibility that is essential for mediation. In conclusion, I want to reaffirm once again that Mongolia fully supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s vision for reform that can make the United Nations less bureaucratic and more efficient, productive and field- oriented. After all, that is the only way that the United Nations can become stronger and more responsive to the people it serves. The Acting President: I now call on His Excellency Mr. AurÃ©lien Agbenonci, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Benin.",1,196
7821,Session 72 - 2017,MOZ_72_2017.txt,MOZ_72_2017,72,2017,MOZ,"I have the honour to address the seventy-second session of the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, who could not attend this gathering owing to other commitments at home. Allow me therefore to start by conveying President Nyusiâ??s good wishes for a successful session of the Assembly, which is the highest forum for global political and diplomatic dialogue. I would like to take this opportunity to join the speakers who preceded me in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I assure you of the full commitment of Mozambique to contributing to the realization of the goals we have all envisaged to achieve during this important session. We trust that your gifted leadership and diplomatic experience will add value to our endeavours and contribute to the success of the work of this session. I wish equally to congratulate your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his stewardship and commitment to fulfilling the agenda at the last session of the General Assembly. A special word of appreciation goes to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary- General, for the vision and leadership he has displayed in this, his first year in office. We believe that he is steering the Organization onto the right path in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness as it serves us, the Member States, in our quest to deliver on the ambitious goals we have set for our peoples. Only a strong and vibrant United Nations system can ensure that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its goals will deliver societies that are more inclusive, peaceful and prosperous than ever, without compromising the very existence of our planet. Two years after we pledged our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, the world remains confronted with multiple and complex challenges that threaten to constrain the gains we made in fostering global peace and stability, stall and reverse the advances made in fostering social and economic wellbeing of our peoples, and cause irreversible damage to our planet. We therefore welcome the theme chosen for this session by the President of the General Assembly, namely, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, as it allows this body to reflect in a timely manner on how best to address the challenges before us. This reflection in a multilateral forum such as the General Assembly is essential if we are to coordinate and consolidate our approaches as we strive individually and collectively to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. The renewed focus on people should serve as a universal impetus for all the development actors to translate into practice actions that promote peace and the well-being of all humankind. It is worth recalling that our resolve is to make the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a framework that brings together the collective will to transform peopleâ??s lives in a sustainable way by lifting them from poverty and promoting human dignity without neglecting peace, which is a critical factor in the attainment of sustainable development, based on the interplay of the economic, social and environmental pillars. As we strive to accomplish these goals, we are challenged to find the ways and means to honour the commitments undertaken in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Only joint and complementary efforts in those three domains will enable us to build the necessary resilience at the national, regional and international levels commensurate with the challenges before us and in line with our aspiration of leaving no country behind. The challenges we faced and the experiences we gained in the implementation of other globally agreed development goals in the past underline the need for greater commitment from our development partners to scale up and honour their assistance and for funding pledges made to support climate resilience, mitigation and adaptation, as well as disaster-prevention efforts in developing countries. This support is of paramount importance to mitigating the effects of climate variability, whose devastating effects have been laid bare in the last two months in several States Members of this body.Furthermore, it is also clear that a robust and efficient United Nations system, together with a strong partnership between the Organization and the regional bodies, can play a catalytic role in accelerating national development and strengthening democratic political systems and institutions that can lead to more inclusive and peaceful societies. In that vein, we support the ongoing efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to reform and reposition the United Nations development system with a view to making it more responsive to the development needs of its Members. The overwhelming challenges of our times require bold and determined political will to achieve the results we seek. Mozambique reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, since focusing on people has always been at the core of Mozambiqueâ??s national development agenda. Accordingly, we have aligned our national development agenda to include the three dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which are now reflected in the five pillars of our national five-year plan, namely, consolidating national unity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and social capital; promoting employment, productivity and competitiveness; developing economic and social infrastructures; and ensuring sustainable and transparent management of natural resources and the environment. Mozambique has created a multi-stakeholder national reference group that encompasses Government, civil society, the private sector and international cooperation partners for the management of the Sustainable Development Goals and is promoting capacity-building for its implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In the effort to consolidate national unity, peace and sovereignty, our focus on people leads us to strive to ensure that lasting peace and stability is a reality to all Mozambicans. Durable peace and stability therefore ranks as an overarching priority in our national agenda, as it is a crucial factor for the development and promotion of lasting human security in the broadest sense. Accordingly, the Government of Mozambique, under the leadership of President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, is striving for an inclusive dialogue with all political actors and civil society through both formal and informal mechanisms, including the Parliament. This inclusive approach is also used to engage Mozambicans in the conceptualization and implementation of the national development agenda. Furthermore, our focus on people envisages not leaving anyone behind, which is one of the guiding precepts of our universal agenda. Therefore, particular attention is given to policies and strategies aimed at the protection and the full enjoyment of human rights, the promotion of gender equality and equity as well as the empowerment of women and youth, who constitute the majority of our people. Mozambique believes that our focus on people, peace, a decent life and a sustainable planet also requires a regional dimension, particularly in the context of a globalized world. We are therefore encouraged by the contributions that regional and international multilateral mechanisms have made to prevent and manage conflicts and to promote peace and stability, in particular those under the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, to which we are proud to belong. We believe that mechanisms that promote peace and prosperity should also constitute a strong platform of action aimed at fostering dialogue among civilizations, an unquestionable tool in the promotion of a culture of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and a sustainable world. We pledge to continue to play our role in these endeavours. Our resolve to focus on people entails that we address with a sense of urgency the root causes of the increase in unregulated migration and the massive flows of refugees, two dimensions of the human crises that we are confronted with in modern times. This regrettable reality is in great part a consequence of a succession of unresolved crises or poorly settled conflict situations in relation to which the international community bears a responsibility. In that connection, we risk achieving an ineffective and fragile peace if the international community remains focused on short-term and ad hoc measures that leave scope for the recurrence of the same intractable problems at a later stage. The international community should come together to redouble efforts and to build consensus to prevent the senseless loss of lives. We need to adopt measures to reduce peopleâ??s vulnerabilities, complemented by actions that address the complex and structural causes of these mass movements, such as conflicts and political, social and economic exclusion. A focus on people on a sustainable planet also requires urgent attention to climate change. Today more than ever before, the challenges posed by the adverse impact of climate change are noticeable. Everyday we are confronted by the destructive impact of climate change, challenging those who continue to harbour doubts about the effects of human activities on the environment and on the climate. The recent devastating effects of the hurricanes, the mudslides and the earthquake that affected millions of people in the Caribbean region, the United States of America, Sierra Leone and Mexico are vivid reminders of the scale of the natural disaster threats we face. I would like to seize this opportunity to convey to the affected people and countries a message of solidarity and sympathy on behalf of the people and the Government of Mozambique. The great human losses and the destruction of infrastructure as a result of the scale and ferocity of these storms prove once again that, beyond our convictions, we need to reflect and to act as a common front to face the menaces arising from climatic change. To that end, we reaffirm the importance of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as an instrument to strengthen the much-needed partnerships for adaptation and mitigation measures. The positive dynamics generated by the major development commitments made by the international community in 2015 have been overshadowed by the worrying signs of the eruption of political instability, the prevailing inter- and intra-State conflicts, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, the rising tensions in the Korean peninsula, as well as by the recurrence of acts of terrorism and of violent extremism. These challenges to peace and stability threaten to reverse the development gains registered over the recent decades and to hinder our development efforts as we chart the way forward. Therefore, it is our hope that the ongoing peace initiatives as well as the measures to curb the recruitment and finance of terrorist groups will result in opportunities to further promote peace and development, as well as to strengthen human rights and to build more inclusive societies. Only through constructive dialogue and peaceful means and solutions can we secure durable peace and stability in our world. To that end, we would like to emphasize the importance of strong democratic institutions at the national level, the impact of regional cooperation and the role of the United Nations. As we gather in this great Hall, the world is once again facing the threat of the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which have become the most dangerous existential threat that humankind faces in the twenty-first century. As a country with a Constitution that values the principle of the universal disarmament of all States and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, as well as the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Mozambique notes with great concern the escalation of tension and the risk of nuclear confrontation that is unfolding on the Korean peninsula. The catastrophic impact of a nuclear conflict demands a more restrained approach based on dialogue, skilful diplomacy and the political will to de-escalate and to fully comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions. More than anything else, the resolutions signal our collective disapproval of the course of events in that part of the world. The lack of progress in the decolonization of Western Sahara, the sole African country still to exercise the right to self-determination, continues to be a cause for grave concern to Mozambique. Regrettably, all the efforts deployed by the United Nations, the African Union and other actors to bring about an accepted settlement aiming to grant the people of Western Sahara their inalienable right to self-determination and independence has not yielded results. We would like to seize this opportunity to call upon the Security Council, the General Assembly and the international community to exercise their responsibility by implementing their own resolutions, particularly regarding the principle of self-determination and right of freedom, as well as to support the African Union and its Special Envoy to Western Sahara, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, former President of Mozambique. The principle of self-determination and the right to freedom should also be a reality for the Palestinian people. To that end, it is imperative that the relevant Security Council resolutions be implemented. We believe that the solution relies on the two-State principle of Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side, in peace and security. Mozambique has followed with great interest the efforts of Cuba and the United States of America to stabilize the diplomatic relations between these two neighbouring countries, an important step towards the normalization of bilateral relations and bringing to an end the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of Americaagainst Cuba. In that context, we note with concern the latest developments and appeal to the United States of America to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo, for it hinders the socioeconomic development of Cuba and the Cuban people. Therefore, Mozambique once again associates itself with the overwhelming majority of countries in this Hall to demand the immediate termination of this unilateral coercive measure. We live in a world confronted by challenges that demand global responses. The relevance of the United Nations, the lodestar of multilateralism, over the past 72 years of its existence has always rested in its ability to reform and reinvent itself to respond more suitably to the challenges of the continuously changing world that it serves. Therefore, Mozambique supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts to pursue reform of the United Nations system in order to make it fit for purpose, and commends his demonstrated desire to fully consult and seek consent of the United Nations membership at each stage of the process. In addition to the ongoing reforms, we also need to urgently accelerate Security Council reform, another element that will contribute to reaffirming the role of the United Nations in the quest for sustainable solutions to the peace and security challenges facing humankind. The difficulties stemming from the lack of consensus among members to initiate text-based negotiations to complete the reform of the Security Council constrain our ability to open a new window of opportunity that would enhance the credibility of the organ by making it more representative of the current reality. The Security Council is one of the fundamental pillars of the success of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I would like to conclude by reiterating the unconditional commitment of the Government of Mozambique to continuing to engage, in partnership with the United Nations and fellow Member States, in the search of sustainable solutions to the problems that affect the humanity. History has shown us that humankind thrives best when we, the peoples, are able to share, collaborate, cooperate, engage in dialogue and care. The General Assembly will always be the platform where we renew our commitment and rededicate ourselves to the noble ideals on which this great Organization was founded â?? to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Let us all stay loyal to these lofty ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and work together to transform our world.",1,196
7822,Session 72 - 2017,MRT_72_2017.txt,MRT_72_2017,72,2017,MRT,"It gives me pleasure to read out the statement of His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Azia, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, on the occasion of the convening of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. â??First, I would like to express our sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k and to his friendly country, Slovakia, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to express my deep appreciation for Mr. Peter Thompson and his valuable efforts during his presidency of the seventy-first session. I would also like to greatly commend the tireless and noble efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, in leading our Organization and in the service of international peace and security. â??The theme of our session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is a appropriate choice in a world witnessing great challenges. In that regard, Mauritania plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of international peace and security in the Sahel and the Sahara regions through a comprehensive approach based on openness, dialogue, professionalism and firmness. Our efforts have been crowned with success against terrorist groups after fierce battles in 2010 and 2011. â??In spite of an extremely complex regional situation, experts have noted that Mauritania has succeeded in dealing with terrorism and extremism. We have developed our security and defence capabilities in record time, with due attention to individual and collective rights and with extreme care for the least fortunate of society. That has been achieved by adopting a policy of sustainable development. Reporters Without Borders noted improvement over three successive years of continuous progress at the Arab and regional levels. We have also established a policy of dialogue, while ensuring the freedoms of expression, demonstration and organization, as well as human rights, after the so-called Arab Spring that swept over certain Arab countries. â??We have succeeded in establishing a political dialogue with the majority and the opposition since 2011 and introduced substantive legislative and organizational reforms, thereby empowering Mauritanian women and establishing the value of citizenship and goodwill for all. We have also promoted good governance and comprehensive dialogue with the opposition, civil society and independent persons, and since September and October 2016 we have succeeded in further establishing our democracy, the rule of law and the organization of public resources. â??Our region faces grave dangers in terms of climate change, terrorism, organized crime, drugs, illegal weapons and illegal migration. Mauritania has improved its legal framework in accordance with international rights and standards, established 14 agreements and protocols relating to terrorism, and created an open dialogue with Salafists and religious extremists in order to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society. â??Our efforts have helped us achieve a high standing in the ranking by Australiaâ??s Institute for Economics and Peace, and we have succeeded in fighting drug-trafficking, being, on a list of 12 States prepared by the United States State Department, the only one that has succeeded in dealing with the issue. We have also succeeded in dealing with illegal migration. According to the statistics of the International Organization on Migration, we reduced the number of illegal migrants from 36,000 in 2006 to zero in 2014. We have hosted more than 60,000 refugees so far and have been commended for our efforts in that regard. â??Mauritania has played a leading role in the establishment of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which also includes Mali, the Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad. We host the secretariat of this regional organization, where together we coordinate our actions in the areas of security and development. The organization has set out many joint programmes and projects that have gained great interest from our international partners. The five members of the Group have also established a Joint Force and have coordinated their military and security operations with the headquarters located in Mali. â??The issue of human rights holds great importance in our national policy. Since 2012, slavery has been criminalized, and our legal codes have been strengthened to deal with the vestiges of slavery throughout the country. We have also set out a road map that includes 29 recommendations on fighting terrorism. In accordance with the relevant documents of the United Nations, we established a social security agency that deals with the issue and assists all those who have suffered from it across the country. â??We have also resolved the issues that Mauritanian refugees face regarding repatriation and marginalization, making it possible for them to have a decent life and reintegrate into society, as well as providing them with them employment opportunities and enjoyment of their rights. â??The large majority of the countries participating in the Universal Periodic Review of human rights have commended Mauritania and its policies. Mauritanian women have acquired great importance in the country and have been the subject of several initiatives to enable them to be present in all sectors and compete freely in fields that were previously monopolized by men, as well as participate adequately in political and social life. We have worked to enable Mauritanian women to join regional and international organizations by proposing their candidatures, and we have had considerable success in becoming a member of certain important United Nations committees. â??With a view to establishing justice and equality for all people, we have introduced major reforms in our legal codes to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, to fight corruption and bribery and to promote transparency. This has allowed Mauritania to rank high among 26 African countries in this field, according to a study prepared by the International Monetary Fund. â??In view of our important strategic position, we have striven to follow an economic investment policy that guarantees the rights of the investor, with a view to attracting foreign investment. We were awarded 16 points in Doing Business, prepared by the World Bank for 2016-2017, and are among the five countries in the world experiencing the highest rate of improvement. â??Crowning the credibility of the country at the regional and continental level has been our chairing of the African Union (AU), following our chairing the AU Peace and Security Council. During our mandates we have striven to participate in reaching peaceful solutions to the crises in CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, Libya, Mali and Burundi. We have also participated positively in solving the crisis in The Gambia, and we strive continuously to assist other countries in overcoming their crises. We presided over the League of Arab States in 2016, organizing the summit meeting in Nouakchott for the first time. â??With regard to the Palestinian cause, Mauritania calls upon the Assembly to work for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative, the Madrid principles and other relevant international resolutions. â??We also call for the settlement of the crisis in Yemen by supporting the legitimacy represented by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, and we welcome every effort by the United Nations in that crisis. With regard to Libya, we call upon all parties concerned to redouble their efforts to stand up to armed groups and restore stability and security to that country. We also urge all parties concerned to make every effort to reach a settlement to the Syrian crisis. â??Climate change is a great challenge facing us all in terms of sustainable development, particularly in the Sahel and Sahara area. We have experienced the phenomenon of the migration of sand dunes, which has destroyed huge agricultural areas and grazing lands. We have prepared appropriate policies to deal with that problem and have invested in the use of renewable sources of energy. We have been commended. for our efforts in that regard, as one of the few African countries using renewable energy sources, â??Mauritania hosts the headquarters of the Great Green Wall, an ambitious project over 7,000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide, connecting the Atlantic coast of West Africa to the Red Sea in the East, benefiting 11 countries of the region. We also welcomed the historic 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and hope that all parties will uphold their commitments. â??The reform of the United Nations and the adaptation of its bodies to deal with new challenges â?? particularly the Security Council, which is responsible for international peace and security â?? have become an urgent necessity. We support every effort in that regard. â??There is no doubt that the establishment of justice and the spreading of a culture of peace and tolerance among people and the renouncing of terrorism, extremism and violence would encourage and help establish peace and security and realize sustainable development in the world. â??The Islamic Republic of Mauritania calls upon all Member States to work together for a world that enjoys multilateralism and respects the principles of the United Nations with a view to establishing peace, stability and security in which people live peacefully together.â??",1,196
7823,Session 72 - 2017,MUS_72_2017.txt,MUS_72_2017,72,2017,MUS,"Let me begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the people and the Government of Mexico following the devastating earthquake that has taken the lives of hundreds of men, women and children. It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time as the Prime Minister of Mauritius. I am here today to reaffirm my countryâ??s continued commitment to the universal values of the Organization. I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I assure you of our total support as you steer the work of the Assembly. The six priorities that you have identified under the theme of focusing on people echo our own aspirations as a nation. We extend our warm congratulations to Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as the new Secretary- General. I commend him for the multidimensional vision he has for the United Nations and for the process that he has initiated on the repositioning of the United Nations development system to effectively and efficiently deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We also welcome the consultative process that he has initiated with Member States in that regard. We fully support his initiative and encourage him to make greater use of modern communication technology and of local capacities in the implementation of United Nations-sponsored projects. We also appreciate his view that the reform we seek is but part of a larger reform of the United Nations system, including the revitalization of the role of the General Assembly. The last time there was a reform of the Security Council was in 1965. That was more than 50 years ago, and Assembly membership then stood at 117. We now have 193 Member States. The Security Council needs to reflect those changes, and that should be done at the earliest. I believe the time has now come for us to proceed with text-based negotiations to be concluded within an agreed time frame. The African Common Position on this matter, which has so far not been challenged, can with appropriate additions provide a basis for such negotiations. Mauritius fully supports the Ezulwini Consensus and Africaâ??s aspiration for a more pronounced role in the Security Council. For far too long, Africa has been left on the side when it comes to global governance. It is time to correct that gross injustice. We also fully support Indiaâ??s aspiration to a seat on the Security Council. We equally believe that small island developing States (SIDS) must play a more prominent role in the Security Council and that their call for a dedicated non-permanent seat is legitimate and appropriate. The maintenance of peace and security requires tremendous and constant effort, negotiation, understanding and compromise. Mauritius voted in favour of the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last July, and we hope to see complete denuclearization throughout the world. We urge all those involved in potential conflicts around the world, especially where there is a possibility of nuclear weapons being used, to exercise restraint and promote dialogue instead of belligerent posturing, which only feeds unrest and dangerous escalation. We urge restraint and dialogue in Myanmar, where violence continues to displace thousands of people and has caused numerous victims. We make an appeal for the unrestricted provision of humanitarian assistance to all those affected. We also call for the early implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State with a view to finding a long-lasting solution. Despite our best efforts, terrorism continues to claim innocent lives and undermine the sovereignty of States. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, wherever they occur, and we stand in solidarity with the Governments and the peoples that are victims of terrorism. We congratulate the Secretary-General on establishing the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. We expect the new Office to provide leadership, coordination and coherence, to strengthen assistance for capacity- building to Member States, and to improve visibility, advocacy and resource mobilization for United Nations counter-terrorism efforts. We also need to address the root causes of that scourge, and we expect the Office to provide valuable input in that regard. The situation in the Middle East and the plight of the Palestinian people continue to be issues of great concern. We call on all sides to sincerely start talks for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue. Mauritius has always supported a two-State solution, with Palestine and Israel living peacefully side by side. An independent and viable Palestine is more likely to provide security both to Israel and the region. Mauritius highly values the importance of its integration within Africa and believes in the universal benefits of the continental integration of Africa. The Agenda 2063 of the African Union, adopted in January 2015, is in consonance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and provides a strategy for development that is people-driven and respectful of the rule of law. That vision of Africa will be carried by its people and youth, and Africa is today home to a growing youthful population and experiencing increased urbanization. Along with the digital transformation of the continent, improving infrastructure and connectivity, and its rich wind, hydro and solar capacity, Africa has the potential of becoming a beacon for sustainable development. It is geared to become a driver of economic growth and a huge consumer market. In July, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development met to review the status of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda two years after its adoption. I would like to congratulate the 44 countries that presented their voluntary national reviews. In Mauritius, a coordinating mechanism has been set up for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . We are in the process of consultations with the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders, and we expect to submit our voluntary national review at the next High-level Political Forum, in 2018. Addressing climate change is central and critical to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. With the increasing number and intensity of climate-related disasters, including storms, droughts and flash floods, it would be naÃ¯ve on our part to dismiss climate change. We have just recently witnessed the devastating violence of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. I would like to express my Governmentâ??s deep sympathy to and solidarity with the Governments and the peoples of the islands of the Caribbean and the United States for the lives lost in the devastating trails of those hurricanes. Mitigating the effects of climate change and effectively implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction will require substantial effort and resources, especially for SIDS, if we want to be more resilient in the aftermath of those natural calamities. Although we welcome the generous pledges made thus far, including the establishment of the Green Climate Fund, we need to streamline and simplify the procedures for SIDS to access those funds, especially in the light of recent events. This yearâ??s High-level Political Forum recognized the specific challenges faced by SIDS and middle-income countries. Classification as a middle-income country renders SIDS such as Mauritius ineligible for most official development assistance (ODA) and concessional funding. Middle-income countries are often victims of their success in graduating from the status of least developed country and run the risk of getting stuck in the middle-income trap. Middle-income SIDS such as Mauritius aspire to be partners in development rather than mere recipients of ODA. With the help of the United Nations development system and other partners, as well as the provision of tailor-made programmes, those countries can contribute to the sharing of experience and knowledge with countries aspiring to graduate from LDC status and consolidate their own economic development at the same time. Oceans are of vital importance to SIDS. Mauritius, with its exclusive economic zone of more than 2.3 million square kilometres, is a large-ocean State. That is why my Government has developed an ocean strategy covering fisheries, tourism and deep-ocean- water applications, as well as resource exploration and exploitation. We call on our partners to assist us in implementing that strategy, as expressed in paragraph 13 (q) of the Call for Action of the United Nations Ocean Conference. Mauritius is honoured to co-chair the High-level Panel on Water convened by the former Secretary- General and the President of the World Bank. The Panel met today to take stock of the progress achieved following the adoption of its action plan in September 2016, which called for a transformative approach to the management of water resources. The outcome package of the Panel is expected to make concrete proposals for the achievement of the targets of SDG 6, and we hope that all world leaders will support it. Adherence to international law, safeguarding fundamental human rights and respect for the territorial integrity of countries underpin relations among countries. With regard to Mauritius, all those principles were flouted when an integral part of its territory, namely, the Chagos Archipelago, was excised prior to its independence, in violation of international law, including obligations reflected in resolutions 1514 (XV), of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX), of 16 December 1965, and all the inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago were forcibly evicted. Our decolonization remains to be completed five decades following the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. A crucial role of the International Court of Justice is to provide guidance through its advisory opinions to the organs and agencies of our Organization for the fulfilment of their responsibilities. It is in that spirit that States members of the Group of African States proposed a resolution in June seeking an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. We were very pleased that the resolution was adopted, and even more so by the fact that it was by such a resounding majority. That vote demonstrated the great importance that Member States from across the globe â?? not just in Africa, but also in Europe, Asia and the Americas â?? attach to the need to complete the process of decolonization, as well as their concern for the injustices caused to the evicted inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago. As a matter of fact, that overwhelming vote has renewed their hope that they might finally return to their place of birth. The United Nations membership has indeed made it clear that it wishes to see the decolonization process of Mauritius completed, and, to that end, has turned to the International Court of Justice for guidance. We are hopeful that the Courtâ??s advisory opinion will not only guide the important work of the General Assembly, but will also allow Mauritius to move forward, including with an appropriate programme in favour of the inhabitants who were displaced from that part of the Mauritian territory. Many members had the opportunity in June to see an exhibition on the tragedy surrounding that eviction and to interact with those who were forced to leave in such inhumane conditions. We thank Member States for their support and look forward to their continued encouragement as we complete our decolonization. In this regard, we express the hope that as many Member States as possible will contribute to the proceedings in which the Court has invited them to participate. I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that Mauritius has no intention of seeking the disruption of the security arrangements currently in place in Diego Garcia, the largest island of the Chagos archipelago. I would also like to reiterate what successive Mauritian Governments have clearly stated. Mauritius is willing to enter into a long-term renewable lease with the United States to allow these security arrangements to remain in place. In this regard, completing the process of decolonization will enhance security by providing legality and certainty. With respect to Tromelin, which has always formed and continues to form an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we welcome the constructive progress made with France, including the agreement reached in 2010. During this seventy-second session of the General Assembly, we have an opportunity to commit ourselves to agreements and decisions that would considerably improve the lives of ordinary people all around the world. As we prepare to turn this planet over to later generations, I would renew our commitment to striving for a world where peace, security and prosperity do not remain mere distant dreams.",1,196
7824,Session 72 - 2017,MWI_72_2017.txt,MWI_72_2017,72,2017,MWI,"The cause that rallies us together is that we are one humankind on one planet. That is the tie that binds us all, and all our differences and national interests are secondary to that overriding cause. The United Nations was founded to safeguard the human race, its human rights and its potential. We are here to protect people, their existence and their rights. We are here to ensure that the potential of every people, everywhere, fully blossoms into flowers of hope. It is our sacred duty as a generation to take actions that offer hope to following generations. It is therefore fitting that this year we are meeting to think about focusing on people. In Africa, we should be focusing on investing in the people if the full potential of African people is to be realized. The eradication of poverty and the pursuit of prosperity across the world should be based on raising the potential of the people we seek to support. Development cannot be taken to any people and succeed unless it is driven from within. No human community can take off economically without empowering its people to drive their own development agenda. That is why I underline the importance of investing in our human capital. However, it is also a foregone conclusion that any effort to invest in the people and raise their potential needs our collaboration as a global family; hence our appeal for concerted action by all States Members of the United Nations and, indeed, many global non-State actors. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations reflects our global resolve to address the worldâ??s most pressing challenges in the spirit of sustainable human collaboration. Our unity among nations is imperative because we achieve more when we unite and collaborate. The well-being of global society is more assured when we work in partnerships for development. At the same time, we achieve more within our nations when we include all sectors of society. Statistics provided by the United Nations and the World Bank show that there is a correlation between the inclusion and empowerment of women, on the one hand, and economic growth and development, on the other. The inclusion and empowerment of women begin with a focus on the girl child. We need to do away with early marriages. Indeed, I am pleased to note a global drop in early marriages from 36 per cent to 26 per cent over a period of two years since 2015. Malawi is proud to be part of that achievement. Among other initiatives, my Government has enacted a law against marriage below the age of 18. By law, Malawi provides an opportunity for girls to grow, mature and make informed choices about their education and future life, so they are legally protected in that regard. I am therefore proud to reiterate my Governmentâ??s commitment to promoting gender equality and women and girlsâ?? empowerment in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of women and adolescent girls to violence and all forms of abuse. Another critical category in the focus on people is young people. Youth empowerment is a way to achieve inclusion. According to African Economic Outlook 2015, Africa has the fastest-growing and youngest population in the world. In giving young people the focus they deserve, the African Union agreed in 2015 to designate 2017 the Year of the Youth. This is the year we focus on investing in young people. Malawi is honoured to be part of the mission for youth empowerment. We have taken decisive measures that include providing technical and entrepreneurial education to the young people who have not had the opportunity to attend university. At the same time, we are also increasing access to tertiary education. One more category that needs inclusion is that of persons with disabilities. Malawi is reviewing its policies and strategies in education, health and trade in order to foster the effective inclusion of persons with disabilities. We have also made strides in efforts to eradicate vicious and irrational attacks against persons with albinism. There was a time when these attacks were rampant in some parts of the country. I am glad to report that there have not been any new ones in the past six months. Malawi is committed to inclusive development. We recognize, however, that the majority of our citizens continue to depend on agriculture for their livelihood. But agriculture is a challenging sector, given the current climate variability affecting many parts of the world. That being the case, Malawi is implementing social protection programmes aimed at cushioning the vulnerable in our society. Our measures include cash transfer programmes, food for work, school feeding programmes and a farm income subsidy programme. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to cooperating partners, including the United Nations, for their continued technical and other support to the success of these programmes. As we think of focusing on people, it is important to pay close attention to the issues that affect our most vulnerable citizens. Climate change tops the list. For an economy that depends on agriculture, like that of Malawi, where 85 per cent of the people live in agrarian communities, crop failure is always a tragedy. For the past two years, Malawi has suffered alternating heavy rains, floods and drought that have led to crop failure and hunger. The suffering caused by climate change is evident everywhere; it is real. The people who suffer in these tragedies are not just figures and statistics, but real human souls. We must all feel the urgent need to collectively undertake sustainable management of our natural resources. We must remember that if this planet perishes, we all perish with it. This is a matter that demands our collective responsibility. I therefore appeal to all Member States to consider strategies and avenues of collaboration that will enable us to adapt to the fast-changing climate. Apart from climate change, our world is also collectively facing the threat of terrorism. Terrorism and conflict hinder progress and leave the world in a state of fear, and anything that causes humankind to live in a state of fear is an evil to be fought. Malawi stands in solidarity with the victims of terrorism across the world. We reaffirm our commitment to standing against all forms of terrorism and we stand in solidarity with the victims of human trafficking and forced migration, wherever they are. Let me now move on to the question of peace. Peace is a prerequisite for development. As a country, we believe in peace as a necessary condition for human existence. For that reason, Malawi has been active in the peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations of the United Nations and the African Union. Today, Malawi reaffirms its pledge to continue to act as an envoy of peace. We believe that is our duty to humankind. We believe that in protecting our neighbours, we protect ourselves. While we all seek peace as a necessary condition for existence, we also still face the threat of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are an existential threat to humankind and of concern to us all. Ironically, even those nations that possess nuclear weapons are concerned about such threats. The idea of stockpiling nuclear weapons puts the wisdom of humankind in question. Let me categorically express my Governmentâ??s disapproval of the spread of ballistic-missile technology, which should not be tolerated in any way by any State Member of the United Nations. No country is too small to contribute to the peace agenda of the world and no continent is too poor to be part of the global peace agenda. Malawi strongly supports the African position in favour of our continentâ??s full representation on the Security Council. The United Nations can no longer claim to take the lead in democracy while sidelining the representation of 1.2 billion people in Africa. How can we claim to be united with those whom we exclude? Africa must be included at the table of global governance. Our rising Africa is always ready to play its role in the global community, and Malawi will continue to be a global player.",1,196
7825,Session 72 - 2017,MYS_72_2017.txt,MYS_72_2017,72,2017,MYS,"I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I am confident that under his able stewardship, the General Assembly â?? the main deliberative and policy-making organ of the United Nations â?? will see substantial development and advancement in addressing the many challenges that our Organization faces today. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as the ninth Secretary- General. I assure him that his endeavour to make the United Nations an effective, relevant and august Organization has Malaysiaâ??s fullest support and cooperation. The theme of the Assemblyâ??s seventy-second session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is most relevant and timely as we work collectively and individually to achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. That journey will not be easy. Some have even proposed that it should be the only focus for the entire international community â?? to strive towards ensuring our future survival in an inclusive manner. We must strengthen our resolve and fulfil our promise to each and every citizen of the world that no one will be left behind. On that basis, Malaysia has always oriented its development agenda to accomplish that very promise. Sustainable development has been at the heart of Malaysiaâ??s development approach since the 1970s. In 2009, the Malaysian Government launched its new economic model, which features three new goals: high income, inclusivity and sustainability. Those pursuits continue to resonate well with the three components of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development â?? economic growth, social needs and environmental protection. We have also adopted forward-looking development policies through the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, which spans the five years from 2016 to 2020, under the theme â??Anchoring growth on peopleâ??. That development plan reaffirms the Malaysian Governmentâ??s commitment to a vision of growth anchored in the prosperity and well- being of its people, while protecting the environment and strengthening peace. In July, Malaysia presented its voluntary national review at the High-level Political Forum on SDGs. The review, which reports the actions and measures taken by Malaysia to advance the implementation of the SDGs, is testimony to Malaysiaâ??s continued commitment to achieving the 2030 Agenda. The Government of Malaysia strives to ensure that each and every Malaysian has an equitable share in the prosperity and wealth of the country and that no one is left behind. Earlier this week, Malaysia joined other Member States in signing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that the political and legal impact of the Treaty will steer the international community collectively towards the elimination of nuclear weapons and the maintenance of a world free of nuclear weapons. We were guided by the commitment of States to an instrument that is legally sound and feasible to implement, one that sends a powerful political message that nuclear weapons are categorically unacceptable. Malaysia strongly believes in continuing to strengthen and enhance legislative and collective enforcement capabilities in confronting international security threats, particularly the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and specifically to non-State actors. We remain steadfastly committed to our international obligations in the fields of disarmament and international security through various national, regional and international approaches. In that connection, Malaysia reiterates its strong condemnation of the nuclear tests and missile launches of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which seriously undermined the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Malaysia calls on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to refrain from conducting further nuclear tests and missile launches, to halt its nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and to comply fully with its international obligations in the interests of the maintenance of international peace and security. Malaysia joins other nations in stressing the need for an immediate resumption of peaceful dialogue and negotiations among the relevant parties with a view to finding a durable solution to the long- standing conflict. We are also seeing a convergence of new security threats emerging from irregular migration and transnational crime activities, which include terrorism, trafficking in persons, illicit drug trafficking, money- laundering and cybercrimes. The threats that we face today have an increasingly regional and international impact, affecting our economies and lives in ways that we have never experienced before. For that reason, Malaysia has made significant efforts to improve its legislation and enforcement capabilities by adopting a holistic approach to preventing and combating those heinous crimes. Sadly, as we devote our attention to peace, a decent life and a sustainable planet, there are people in the world who are suffering from horrifying crimes against humanity. In the past few weeks, we have seen a recurrence of violence instigated by a delusional and desperate militant group of Rohingya in Rakhine state. However, the subsequent clearance operations by Myanmar have claimed countless innocent civilian lives and caused more than 400,000 Rohingya to flee their homes. The indiscriminate violence perpetrated against the Rohingya during those operations is of grave concern to Malaysia and others. Such atrocities have unleashed a full-scale humanitarian crisis that the world simply cannot ignore and must be compelled to act on. If the current situation is not addressed judiciously, the desperate people of Rakhine state will become easy prey to recruitment by extremists, for which prolonged frustration, anger and deprivation provide a fertile breeding ground. Although the Myanmar Government has given its repeated assurances that it will implement measures to resolve the issue, the recent incidents of violence have not assuaged our concerns or assured us that effective safeguards are being put in place on the ground. I therefore call on the Government of Myanmar to end the violence, stop the destruction of life and property and allow immediate, unimpeded access for the delivery of humanitarian aid. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Government of Bangladesh for all it has done in receiving almost half a million Rohingya refugees over the past three weeks. Sheltering such a huge number of refugees puts a strain on any country. Malaysia dispatched humanitarian aid to Bangladesh on 9 September and will do more. In the spirit of compassion and humanity, I call on the international community to support the humanitarian efforts in Bangladesh. Our collective failure to find a solution to the Palestinian question is totally unacceptable. The situation in Palestine remains daunting and appalling as Israel continues to violate international law with its heavy-handed approach to the defenceless Palestinians. As Israelâ??s occupation of Palestinian territory marks its fiftieth year, we must continue to intensify our efforts to find a just and durable solution to the Palestinian question. Malaysia reiterates that any action by Israel aimed at imposing its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the holy city of Jerusalem is illegal and totally unacceptable. We remain extremely concerned about the lack of accountability for the Israeli occupying forces and the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the resulting humanitarian crisis. We are extremely dismayed at the diminishing prospect of peaceful coexistence as Israelâ??s illegal settlement activities continue unabated. The implementation of Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), adopted on 23 December 2016, remains a challenge. In that regard, Malaysia reiterates its support for the work of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its proactive approach regarding the need for a written quarterly report by the Secretary-General on the resolutionâ??s implementation. We urge the international community, especially Member States, to continue to firmly support that vital call. If we continue to enable the resolution to be deliberately weakened in a shameless manner, rendering it unimplementable, we will be guilty of deconstructing any two-State solution. Malaysia will continue to support the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The plight of some 5 million registered Palestine refugees must not be ignored. In view of the Agencyâ??s weakening financial situation, we urge the international community to strengthen its commitment to providing it with financial and other relevant assistance. In our fight against the scourge of violent extremism, Malaysia would like to reiterate the ongoing urgency of taking a moderate approach to countering the propagation of extremism and radicalization. To that end, Malaysia reiterates the call for a global movement of moderates that Prime Minister Najib Razak made in 2010, with the aim of dousing the flames of hatred and halting the influence of extreme and myopic ideas of intolerance, xenophobia and racial hatred, among others. It is imperative that communities of different races, religions and cultures band together in seeking common peaceful aspirations and celebrating their diversity, rather than being influenced by and enticed into extremist traps. Malaysia therefore looks forward to bringing the initiative for a global movement of moderates to the United Nations through a draft resolution at this session. It is imperative that the voices of reason, tolerance and understanding drown out those that glorify the extremism that sows seeds of hatred among our communities. If it is to carry out its arduous tasks, the United Nations cannot afford to stand still and remain idle. Since taking over the helm of the Organization, the Secretary-General, together with the Secretariat, has initiated various efforts to make it more efficient, effective, agile and fit for purpose. Malaysia commends the dynamic leadership of the Secretary-General through his various reform initiatives, which include reviewing the peace and security architecture and enhancing the overall development system and United Nations management reform, among others. Malaysia is of the view that any major reform initiative that might include cost-cutting measures should not hamper or disrupt the Organizationâ??s existing development efforts to achieve peace and a decent life for all. That includes peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding, and development programmes in developing countries, especially in countries in areas of conflict. I wish to express my delegationâ??s full cooperation, support and commitment to working closely with the Secretary-General, all Member States and various stakeholders towards implementing the reform initiatives. Let us strengthen our resolve in fulfilling our collective responsibilities. i assure the Assembly of Malaysiaâ??s continued support and commitment to the agenda of the United Nations and the work of the General Assembly.",1,196
7826,Session 72 - 2017,NAM_72_2017.txt,NAM_72_2017,72,2017,NAM,"The President made a profound statement in saying, â??The United Nations was created for people. Its job is to help people who are striving for peace and a decent life, on a sustainable planet.â?? Namibia congratulates Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We pledge our full support to advancing a people-centred approach to doing business at the United Nations. We also commend His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his outstanding stewardship during his tenure as President of the General Assembly. Yesterday the Secretary-General stressed his commitment towards global unity and multilateralism by saying, â??We call ourselves the international community. We must act as one, because only together, as united nations, can we fulfil the promise of the Charter of the United Nations and advance human dignity for all.â?? As the people of Namibia, we will do everything within our capabilities to support his noble cause during his tenure as Secretary-General of the Organization. We also congratulate Ms. Amina Mohamed, a daughter of Africa, for her well-deserved appointment as Deputy Secretary-General. Let us also not forget His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and the sterling job he did during his tenure as Secretary-General. Development that is not driven by the people and does not translate into improved living conditions for all people is meaningless development. Moreover, development that does not reach all people in an equitable manner will only undermine the peace and stability necessary for sustainable development. Growing income disparities, between and within nations, pose the greatest threat to peace within countries and globally. We in Namibia overcame the inhumane scourge of colonial oppression and racial segregation. Through a deliberate policy of national reconciliation, we succeeded in entrenching peace, security and stability as the pillars of our democracy. We also made significant progress in reducing absolute and relative poverty during the past 27 years. Poverty declined from a high of 70 per cent in 1993 to 18 per cent in 2015. That was in part due to the introduction of a wide range of social safety nets that cover close to 16 per cent of the entire population. While income inequality also declined during the same period, it did not decline by the same magnitude as poverty. We have come to realize that, as long as we continue to have poverty in Namibia, even if it is just 10 per cent, we can never have lasting peace and social justice. Similarly, as long as the wealth of the country is disproportionately in the hands of a few, we cannot have lasting peace and stability. It is for that reason that we have declared full-scale war against poverty and income inequality. We have also declared full-scale war against corruption, because corruption is one of the root causes of poverty and inequality. In line with the belief that people must be at the centre of development, we have coined the phrase â??No Namibian should feel left outâ??. The logic is simple, for inclusivity spells harmony and peace, whereas exclusivity spells disaster, conflict and potential war. Therefore, we commend the President for his choice of a theme for this session: â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. In a climate of ever-increasing uncertainty and unpredictability, it is incumbent upon world leaders to renew faith in multilateralism. The United Nations matters most because it is at the centre of the needs and desires of humankind. Therefore, it must be inclusive by including Africa at the highest decision-making level. By failing to do so, the United Nations runs the risk of losing its respectability. The only sure way to restore trust in the United Nations will be for the Security Council to become more inclusive. The people of Namibia can testify to the importance of multilateralism. Namibia is a child of international solidarity, conceived through the valiant struggle of Namibian patriots, delivered by resolution 435 (1978) and midwifed by the United Nations. Today, thanks to the support of the international community, we are an independent nation founded on the principles of democracy, unity, stability, peace and the rule of law. People-centred development should not extend to only a small part of the population. It must cover all demographic components. Too often, the largest demographic component in our societies â?? namely, our mothers, sisters and daughters â?? are excluded from development. In Namibia, we believe that gender equity is equally important for a stable and harmonious society. A policy decision by the ruling party to introduce 50-50 representation at all party levels has led to a significant improvement in the representation of females to 48 per cent in Namibiaâ??s National Assembly. That is the second-highest level of representation on the continent and among the top five in the world. To give further meaning to that policy directive, women have also been appointed to key positions in the executive branch. That includes the young Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minster â?? who is also the Minister for International Relations and Cooperation â?? the Minister and Deputy Minister for Education, Arts and Culture, the Minister and Deputy Minister for Higher Education, Science and Technology, the Minister and Deputy Minister for Urban and Rural Development and the Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration. Those are powerful positions. Another significant demographic component that we must not neglect is the youth. We in Namibia value the empowerment of the youth. Many of the so-called older guard had been groomed and well prepared in the structures of the ruling party and the Government before they were assigned higher responsibilities. That practice continues with a number of young deputy ministers. Our Attorney General is one of the youngest in the world. Very soon, the last crop of the Tanganyika group â?? the freedom fighters of the 1960s, including myself â?? will make way for the new breed. When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and acceded to the Paris Agreement, we not only reaffirmed the centrality of multilateralism; we also reaffirmed the reality of climate change. What has happened in Sierra Leone, the Caribbean and some parts of the United States â?? and we must also note the recent earthquake in Mexico â?? serve as grim reminders that climate change is real. We have witnessed the stripping away of human dignity, security and hope. We must increase our resolve to address the challenges of climate change. In order to achieve the ambitions of living on a sustainable planet, peace processes and international peacebuilding must be strengthened. We recognize the contribution of women in promoting global peace, both in peace negotiations and through their active participation in peace missions. Namibia supports efforts to increase the representation of women in peace missions around the world, especially in leadership positions. Out of 52 United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions, 26 are in Africa. Therefore, we recognize the institutional partnership between the Security Council and the African Union in the maintenance of international peace and security. The partnership not only enhances cooperation between the two institutions, but also adds greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by the Security Council regarding Africa. Africa should not be seen only as a source of precious primary commodities but as an important and equal partner of the international community with concrete contributions to make. In that context, we welcome the recent Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security, signed by the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, which will enhance coordination between the Africa Union and the United Nations. Namibia stands together with the international consensus that the Israeli occupation of Palestine must end. We reiterate that statehood and independence are the national, inalienable and legal rights of the Palestinian people. We join the call for the two- State solution to be pursued with renewed vigour and determination. Similarly, the people of Western Sahara cannot continue to have their inalienable rights to self- determination and national independence denied. Namibia reaffirms its full and unequivocal support for the rights of the people of Western Sahara to self- determination. We call for the urgent implementation of all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara. Over the past several years, Namibia has been noting the growing rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, which culminated in the reopening of embassies in the two countries. We believe that those efforts should lead to the full lifting of the economic and financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba and its people, who have the right to pursue peace and a decent life. Namibia is committed to supporting the Organization in its efforts to achieve global peace. As Albert Einstein once said, â??Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved through understandingâ??. Let us therefore try to be more tolerant and embrace diverse views through dialogue and understanding, before hastily embarking upon a path of force, which will lead only to conflict and, eventually, to war. The United Nations is a great social experiment. It features small and large nations coexisting in peace and harmony. If the United Nations did not exist today, I would definitely call for the creation of such an organization. Let us continue to treasure the unity of the United Nations, for it is only through unity that we will bring about a world free from fear and conflict. It is only through unity that we will bring about a world free from hunger and poverty. It is only through unity that we will deliver a sustainable planet for our children and their children.",1,196
7827,Session 72 - 2017,NER_72_2017.txt,NER_72_2017,72,2017,NER,"Allow me at the outset to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, as well as my best wishes for your success. I would also like to congratulate the new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, and wish him every success in his mission. The Niger assures him of its full support. The present session is taking place in a specific context, marked by the deterioration of the security situation in some Member States and, recently, by the destruction caused by hurricanes in others. To those affected countries, I would like to reiterate our solidarity and compassion. For those who have the flaw of forgetting or neglecting nature, it has reminded us that often it can be indomitable and has shown us that climate change can at times bring disaster and irremediable losses. We must therefore be aware and resolute in our conviction that new norms of production and consumption are being imposed on us. The Niger is aware that each country is responsible for its own development and each person for his own destiny. However, the most vulnerable countries â?? I am speaking of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States â?? deserve the support and assistance of the more affluent nations. Cooperation and solidarity are essential pillars of our common Organization. It is an original commitment of all Member States to work together so that all peoples can attain a decent standard of living. That is why, while recognizing some positive developments, it is important for the States Members of the United Nations to make a greater commitment to partnership and cooperation in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to combat inequalities among and within States. In that connection, the Niger stresses the imperative need for effective mobilization of the resources needed to finance development, in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Plan. For its part, and to give meaning to the Niger peopleâ??s struggle for prosperity and shared progress, the Government of the Niger has successfully carried out the Economic and Social Development Plan 2012- 2015 and has just adopted a second plan for 2017 to 2021. That plan takes into account the main trends of the Renaissance Programme Act 2 of His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the Republic of the Niger, and of the Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy, Niger 2035. It was designed to continue and amplify the Governmentâ??s efforts to face the immense challenges to our development. It is an expression of our determination to improve, substantially and sustainably, the basic social indicators, guarantee universal rights, realize food self-sufficiency, protect the environment, build strong democratic institutions, defend the integrity of our territory and ensure the security of goods and people throughout the national territory. It also takes into account the main features of the African Unionâ??s Agenda 2063 and those of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Very opportunely, that plan will be presented to the Nigerâ??s technical and financial partners at a donor round table in Paris from 11 to 13 December 2017, under the patronage of the President of the Republic of the Niger. The Niger will mobilize to produce the maximum amount of internal resources to finance the plan, but it also knows it can count on the active solidarity of its development partners. I therefore appeal to States and the private sector that believe in our potential to be a partner in that project. I have just mentioned our development challenges and our responses to them. But our country and all the countries of the Sahel face significant security challenges. In reality, they are strategic threats that may even jeopardize the existence of our States. The Niger is facing three hotbeds of threats. The first is related to the situation in Libya. Without a Government exercising control over the whole territory, with dozens of militias, terrorist groups and all kinds of traffickers and a process in difficulty, the situation is of concern not only for the Libyans but also for neighbouring countries such as the Niger. Because of the uncontrolled movement of arms of all calibres, armed groups have become direct threats to both the Libyan people and neighbouring countries. Until that country is stabilized, we will have no guarantee that the Sahelo-Saharan space will not continue to face violent upheavals. The Niger calls on the entire international community to genuinely commit to the restoration of a democratic order in Libya. The Niger has only one agenda in Libya â?? peace. That is why we believe that we must already be supporting the process of revising the Libyan Political Agreement. We call on all parties to make every effort to ensure that the Libyans themselves are masters of their political destiny; that reconciliation is inclusive and excludes groups terrorists; that the army is unified and national; that militias are disarmed and terrorist groups neutralized; and, lastly, that the referendum and electoral process is undertaken on the basis of a new constitution and consensual electoral laws. The second threat that we face is linked to ongoing presence of Boko Haram in the Lake Chad basin. For more than two years, in synergy with Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria, we have been fighting hard against the terrorist group Boko Haram. That barbarous group, which has claimed several thousand victims, is today considered one of the most cruel of recent years. Thanks to the Multinational Joint Task Force, we have gained meaningful victories and fear has changed sides. Today we have considerably reduced the offensive and harmful capacities of Boko Haram. It is no longer possible for that criminal organization to control and administer, as it did so easily before, any locality in any one of our countries. However, even though they are weakened and wandering, elements of Boko Haram still remain dangerous. They organize suicide attacks by young girls forced to become human bombs or sex slaves, and engage in racketeering and kidnappings. In that connection, I wish to recall the 39 women and children abducted last July in the Niger by the terrorist group Boko Haram. The Government of the Niger remains strongly engaged and mobilized until their liberation. The third threat, and by far the most worrying for us, is the situation in northern Mali. We must resolve two questions there. The first concerns the implementation of the Algiers peace agreements, and the second concerns fight against terrorist groups and traffickers. From our point of view, the most important of those two issues is the fight against terrorist groups and traffickers. Until they are defeated, it will be difficult to implement the peace agreements or to hope for the restoration of the authority of the Malian State throughout its national territory. Therefore our primary objective is the eradication of those groups and the destruction of all trafficking that has become the source of their financing. That is why the member countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) decided to set up a joint armed force. Despite the commitment and determination of the G-5 Sahel member States, we remain deeply concerned by the weak mobilization of the international community to make that force operational. The Niger is convinced that the force will make it possible to impose the conditions for an irreversible balance of power in favour of peace and stability in Mali and therefore throughout the Sahel. I therefore call for a real start so that we can make the necessary decisions. The Niger calls on the Security Council to adopt a new resolution that foresees a commitment of our forces under Chapter VII and to provide a mechanism for predictable and sustainable financing. Moreover, it is simply a matter of reorienting existing resources to enable the force to achieve its objectives. What is at stake in the Sahel is a fight not only for the peace and security of the region, but also for international peace and security. Failing to help the G-5 Sahel and leaving the situation in Mali to deteriorate even further would be a mistake that the Member States should not commit. I would therefore like to thank all partners who already have announced their contribution to the operationalization of the G-5 Sahel joint force. The Niger welcomes the recent consultations undertaken by the Secretary-General and encourages him to continue his efforts to enable the deployment of the force. With regard to peacekeeping operations, is it not time for the United Nations to question their effectiveness and to learn lessons from the shortcomings and failures observed here and there? Indeed, the nature of and actors in those conflicts have changed. We are dealing with non-State actors resorting to asymmetric actions for which peacekeeping missions are neither adapted nor prepared. That is why the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali has become one of the deadliest United Nations missions today. This it is important to review those missions with regard to their composition, their armaments and, especially, their mandate. In discussing the issue of terrorism and the determined fight that our defence and security forces are waging, I would like to say here that the Niger will remain eternally grateful for the sacrifice of its daughters and sons who, with courage and honour, are fighting to preserve and safeguard the integrity of our country. We are certainly paying a heavy price for this fight, but the Niger will continue to play its role and live up to its duty to ensure that never again will any terrorist or criminal organization be able to occupy or take control of any part of our territory. That is why the Government will not stint on its considerable efforts to ensure that our forces take control and that their capacities are boosted. We will never let up in our determination, and I know we will win this war because our cause is noble. Every year thousands of migrants throughout the world put themselves in danger to seek a better life, and the deserts and oceans of the world have become open- air cemeteries. Irregular migrants, victims of criminal smugglers with neither faith nor law, should be protected. The Niger, essentially a transit country, reaffirms its determination to fight the irregular migration networks and will continue to do everything possible to attack the root causes of such migration. That is the meaning of the plan that our country presented at the European Union-African Union Valletta Summit on Migration. I have mentioned the security situation in western and eastern Niger. I would like to recall here that as a result of those conflicts, our country, although among the poorest in the world, is hosting more than 200,000 refugees, internally displaced persons and returnees. For the Niger, what is most important today is to get past those emergencies so as to launch socioeconomic recovery in the areas affected by those conflicts. We need to move from humanitarian issues to development. Turning to certain international issues, I recall that the Niger is in solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom and independence. Our position remains unswerving support for the just and definitive resolution of that question, guaranteeing the creation of a sovereign State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital. The abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar are unacceptable. Such serious and massive violations of human rights must be punished. The Niger unequivocally condemns those atrocities. The Niger, a State party to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, will respect its commitments. We are convinced that there is no alternative for saving our planet and especially for preserving it for future generations. The Paris Agreement is not only the realization of our awareness, but also proof of our shared responsibility before history. Taking a step backward is not possible unless one believes that the fate of the Earth and of humankind is not concern for everybody. The Niger urges the United States of America and Cuba to persevere in the constructive dialogue that had begun between the two countries until relations between the two are normalized and the embargo is fully lifted. The issue of disarmament is a crucial. It deserves special attention to enhance trust among States. The Niger strongly supports the actions undertaken by the United Nations with a view to bringing about general and complete disarmament with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. The new challenges generated by globalization, the transformations that have affected international relations for decades and the need to take into account new geopolitical dimensions, particularly in regard to Africa, require that we deal with the crucial issue of the reform of United Nations organs. In accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus, Niger calls for the composition of the Security Council to be reviewed, for the General Assembly to be revitalized and for the United Nations to remain a democratic Organization that enshrines the sovereign equality of States, not a tiered organization in which the powerful and the weak have different rights. To conclude my remarks before the Assembly, I would like to reaffirm that at every opportunity and before every challenge, my country, the Niger, will always rise to play its proper role to promote and defend peace, to eradicate poverty and inequality and to preserve our environment. We are fully aware of our responsibilities to change our own fate and contribute to making the world safe and better. We assume these responsibilities fully and in a determined manner. May God bless the Niger and the United Nations.",1,196
7828,Session 72 - 2017,NGA_72_2017.txt,NGA_72_2017,72,2017,NGA,"On behalf of my country, Nigeria, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, as well as Mr. Guterres on his first General Assembly session as Secretary-General. I want to assure both men of my countryâ??s solidarity and cooperation. Indeed, they will need the cooperation of all Member States, since we are meeting during extraordinarily troubled and dangerous times. Let me also thank former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his service to the United Nations and to wish him a peaceful retirement. We have witnessed many far-reaching developments over the past year. Some of the most significant events in that period include the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris Climate Agreement and the North Korean nuclear crisis, which is of grave concern.  I must also commend the role played by the United Nations in helping with the settlement of thousands of innocent civilians who have been caught up in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. In particular, we must collectively thank the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the commendable leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the Governments of Italy, Greece and Turkey, for assisting hundreds of thousands of refugees. In an exemplary show of solidarity, the international community came together within my own region to assist the countries and communities in the Sahel and the Lake Chad regions to contain the threats posed by Al-Qaida and Boko Haram. We thank the Security Council for visiting the countries of the Lake Chad basin in order to assess the security situation and humanitarian needs, as well as for pledging assistance to rebuild lives and livelihoods in the region. We in Nigeria are providing relief and humanitarian assistance to millions of internally displaced persons in camps and those afflicted by terrorism, drought, floods and other natural disasters. Over the past year, the international community came together to focus on the need for gender equality, youth empowerment and social inclusion, as well as the promotion of education, creativity and innovation. The frontiers of good governance, democracy, including holding free and fair elections, and the enthronement of the rule of law are expanding everywhere, especially in Africa. Our faith in democracy remains firm and unshaken. Our regional organization, the Economic Community of West African States, came together to uphold democratic principles in the Gambia, just as we had done previously in CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire. Through our individual national efforts, State institutions are being strengthened in order to promote accountability, combat corruption and recover assets. Those goals can be achieved only through the international community cooperating and providing critical assistance and material support. We shall also cooperate in addressing increasing transnational crime, such as forced labour, modern-day slavery, human trafficking and cybercrime. Such cooperative efforts should be sustained. We must collectively devise strategies and mobilize the required responses in order to stop fleeing fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham from mutating and infiltrating the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin, where there are insufficient resources and a weak response capacity. That will require strong cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, such as the African Union, on conflict prevention and management. The United Nations should continue to take primary leadership in the maintenance of international peace and security by providing, in a predictable and sustainable manner, adequate funding and other enablers to regional initiatives and peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security Council. New conflicts should not make us lose sight of ongoing, unresolved old conflicts. For example, several Security Council resolutions from 1967 on the Middle East crisis remain unimplemented. Meanwhile the suffering of the Palestinian people and the blockade of Gaza continue. Additionally, we are now confronted by the desperate human rights and humanitarian situation in Yemen and, most tragically, in Rakhine state in Myanmar. The crisis in Myanmar is very reminiscent of what happened in Bosnia in 1995 and in Rwanda in 1994. The international community cannot remain silent and not condemn the horrendous suffering caused by what, from all indications, is a State-backed programme of brutal depopulation of the Rohingya-inhabited areas of Myanmar on the basis of ethnicity and religion. We fully endorse the call of the Secretary-General and the Government of Myanmar to order a halt to the ongoing ethnic cleansing and ensure the safe return of the displaced Rohingya to their homes in safety and dignity. In all of those crises, the primary victims are the people, the most vulnerable of whom are women and children. That is why the theme of this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is most apposite. While the international community grapples to resolve these conflicts, we must be mindful and focus on the widening inequalities within societies and the gap between the rich and the poor nations. Those inequalities and gaps are part of the underlying root causes of competition for resources, frustration and anger leading to spiralling instability. The most pressing threat to international peace and security today is the accelerated nuclear weapons development programme of North Korea. Since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, we have never been as close to the threat of nuclear war as we are now. Nigeria proposes a strong United Nations delegation to urgently engage the North Korean leader. The delegation, led by the Security Council, should include members from all regions. The crisis on the Korean peninsula underscores the urgency for all Member States, guided by the spirit of ensuring a safer and more peaceful world, to ratify without delay the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which will be open for signature here tomorrow. I end my remarks by reiterating Nigeriaâ??s abiding commitment to the foundational principles and goals of the United Nations. Since our admission as a Member State in 1960, we have always participated in all efforts to bring about global peace, security and development. Nigeria will continue to support the United Nations in all its efforts, including the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",1,196
7829,Session 72 - 2017,NIC_72_2017.txt,NIC_72_2017,72,2017,NIC,"Mr. President, please accept warm greetings from our President, Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, our Vice-President, Rosario Murillo, and the people of Nicaragua, who wish you success in the great responsibility that you have taken on. Many of the issues on the agenda during this session are of vital importance to the survival of our peoples. This year we have witnessed a world in upheaval, driven by multiple crises, including violations of international law and the sovereignty of our peoples, wars and threats of the use of force, and increased poverty and inequality. However, before I go into them, I would like to share my Presidentâ??s reflections summarizing the political will and course of action that must guide us if we are to achieve a better and more peaceful world. â??We must uphold the commitment to continuing to fight for peace, which is the global priority of all of our peoples, and to ensuring that the conflicts that arise in various parts of the world can be overcome through dialogue and negotiation. Above all, we must ensure that we are free from the use or the threat of the use of force, which is what our peoples desire the most from the peoples of the great Powers towards countries with small populations â?? countries that may be small in development but that are great in their values and history.â?? That should be the permanent commitment of the United Nations.On behalf of the people and the Government of Nicaragua, I would like to express our solidarity with all the brothers and sisters of the Greater Caribbean â?? Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cuba, Dominica, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and all the other islands affected by the recent devastating meteorological events that are becoming more intense and more frequent every day â?? and with our brothers and sisters the people and the Government of Mexico, for the two catastrophic earthquakes that occurred there. Our condolences and prayers go to all of the families who have lost loved ones and to the people and the Government of the United States for the hurricanes that have caused major damage in the states of Texas and Florida. Let us focus on the importance of eradicating poverty. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents one of the most important achievements in the history of our Organization. It is a framework for the struggle for a just world order, so that together, in peace, solidarity and complementarity, we can make progress on eradicating poverty. It is deplorable that so much poverty still persists and that inequalities are now more marked than ever. But this development agenda will mean nothing to our peoples if we, the peoples of the world, do not display the political will, commitment and solidarity we need to promote human development with social justice and environmental policies that protect the planet in harmony with nature and ensure the survival of the human species and the life and rights of Mother Earth. Seventy-two years on, our Organization is still unable to fully comply with the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations. We need fundamental reform urgently if we are to tackle that unfortunate situation. To achieve that, we must promote the crucial changes that will enable the Organization to serve the interests of humankind. We would like to point out that, during his presidency of the General Assembly in 2008, the late Father Miguel Dâ??Escoto Brockmann, whom we rightly call Nicaraguaâ??s Chancellor of Dignity â?? may he rest in peace â?? worked on and fought until the very end for that fundamental reform, laying the groundwork for discussing these changes. In that regard, it will be vital to reform the Security Council in order to ensure that its composition and function reflect the geopolitical and economic realities of the international community of the twenty-first century. Negotiations on the issue must enter a more dynamic phase as soon as possible, and a negotiating text must be prepared with the goal of reaching the necessary agreements and proceeding with these reforms during the Assemblyâ??s seventy- second session. We urgently need ambitious action to combat climate change. We note with great concern the unprecedented temperatures that are being registered all over the world and the lack of interest in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The developed countries must take the lead, change their unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and above all meet their financial commitments and complete their technology transfers. The Government and the people of Nicaragua will continue to advocate for a commitment to climate justice, as well as for an essential compensation policy that can be translated into direct and unconditional assistance. We have welcomed the re-establishment of relations between Cuba and the United States of America, but it is upsetting that we are still seeing not only the restoration of measures aimed at maintaining the cruel, inhuman and criminal economic, financial and commercial embargo on Cuba but also threats to its sovereignty. From this rostrum, we join the other voices around the world saying no to the blockade of the heroic people of Cuba, of Fidel, Raul, and Marti. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its Bolivarian revolution continue to contend with foreign harassment, interference and aggression. We condemn the threats of the use of force or military options made by the President of the United States against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a threat that, as has been expressed by Nicaraguaâ??s President, â??has no place. The cry in Latin America and the Caribbean is unanimous â?? nobody wants military intervention from the United States. No one is asking the United States to come and intervene militarily in any Latin American or Caribbean country.â?? We proclaim our unconditional solidarity with the peoples of Bolivar and Chavez, and with the Government led by its constitutional President Nicolas Maduro and his people in their sovereign decision to democratically elect a Constituent National Assembly. Dialogue and negotiation are the only way forward for peace and reconciliation for the great Venezuelan family. We wish our brothers in Colombia every success in implementing their peace accord. Our President has said that Colombia is proving that there can be no military solution to such conflicts, and that after more than 50 years of war, in the end it was negotiations that prevailed. We congratulate Colombia. We salute and will always stand in solidarity with the struggles of the peoples under occupation of the Latin American and Caribbean country of Puerto Rico; of Western Sahara, under the leadership of the Frente Polisario; and of the Argentine Republic in its legitimate sovereign rights over its Malvinas Islands. Nicaragua reiterates its commitment to the establishment of two States of Israel and Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the 1967 borders, with both peoples and Governments living in peace and harmony. We reiterate our total solidarity with the Government and People of Syria in their fight against international terrorism and defence of their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We emphasize the need for a political and negotiated solution between Syrians and an end to foreign intervention, including financing, military training and supplying arms to terrorist groups, so that there may finally be peace. We are very concerned about the increase in terrorist attacks on our brother peoples and condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Nicaragua supports general and complete disarmament and the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Yesterday we signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Verbal confrontations and threats of the use of nuclear weapons are unacceptable. We must work to advance commitments to eliminating nuclear arsenals around the world until they are gone forever, and to use the enormous resources expended on them to eradicate poverty. The situation on the Korean peninsula is of great concern. Nuclear tests contribute nothing to peace and should be condemned. We call for a political and peaceful solution to this dangerous military scenario through dialogue and negotiation, thereby ending the nuclearization of that region and achieving reunification and peace on the Korean peninsula. If we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must repeal unilateral coercive measures that violate international law and hinder our countriesâ?? development plans. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted on the basis of the principle of universality. It is therefore vital to ensure that no one is left behind, and that includes the 23 million Taiwanese who are entitled to participate in the implementation of this global agenda. Taiwan is willing and able to participate in and contribute to the wide range of substantive United Nations programmes aimed at improving the well-being of humankind. We in Central America are strengthening our integration in every area and working with our brothers and sisters to combat the scourges of terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, as well as to transform the Gulf of Fonseca into a zone of peace and development. Our Government continues to work for the restoration of the political, economic, social and cultural rights of all Nicaraguans, with historic and significant results in the areas of equity, gender, investment, development and security. Nicaragua has been recognized by the World Economic Forum as having one of the best records on gender equity in Latin America and indeed the world. Civil and human security is one of our main strengths. That security is fundamental to social, political and economic stability, promoting a better quality of life, tranquillity, justice, peaceful coexistence and the comprehensive development of families. In that regard, Nicaragua has developed a series of specific policies and programmes for combating the scourges of our time, such as terrorism, crime, drug trafficking, trafficking of arms and human trafficking, with very positive results. Working with communities has led to a successful collaboration that makes Nicaragua one of the safest countries in the region and one of the least vulnerable to organized crime. We have succeeded in that by consolidating a serious, constructive and transparent alliance between the Government, workers and the private sector, based on the model for alliance, dialogue and consensus that we have implemented while also relying on valuable international assistance, for which we are grateful. My country has been working extremely hard to make progress in the fight against poverty. We therefore condemn the initiative of a group of United States congressmen who are attempting to damage the economy of Nicaraguan families through a bill known as the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA), currently in the United States Senate, aimed at blocking Nicaraguaâ??s access to international organizationsâ?? programme funds for combating poverty. We want to remind the members of the United States Congress that there is a judgment outstanding by the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, ordering the UnitedStates to compensate the people of Nicaragua for damages incurred from the loss of life and materials caused by acts of terrorism committed by President Reaganâ??s Administration despite congressional opposition, including using drug traffickers to launder money in order to finance a war against Nicaragua while circumventing congressional bans. Nicaragua hopes that Congress will comply faithfully with the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which has ordered that Nicaragua be compensated and that bills such as the NICA Act, promoted by people bent on harming Nicaraguan families, be rejected. In conclusion, I would once again like to quote my President: â??Here before the General Assembly, Nicaragua vows to consistently advocate for peace, stability and security in every part of our planet, in every forum, through every mechanism and with every nation with which we have relations.â??",1,196
7830,Session 72 - 2017,NLD_72_2017.txt,NLD_72_2017,72,2017,NLD,"Every era and every decade has its problems, great and small. The problems we face now seem overwhelming. These days many people worry about the future, which is understandable. The past few years have been marked by terrorist attacks all over the world. In countries like Myanmar, Syria, the Central African Republic and Yemen, the population is suffering as a result of wars and conflicts. More and more people are fleeing their homes because of violence, scarcity or poverty, leaving behind everything they have. Only recently, floods claimed lives in the United States and Asia, and Hurricane Irma has left a trail of destruction in its wake, including in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nuclear issues are once again a major concern, and geopolitical tensions are increasing. That is the picture today. But if we take a long- term perspective â?? and, as a historian, I like to do that â?? there are grounds for optimism. This building here in New York â?? United Nations Headquarters â?? is concrete proof that progress is possible. Here in this inviolable international zone, thousands of people from every continent work together to foster peace, justice and development in a world governed by international law. That is no easy task, far from it. But advances are being made. Sometimes we take three steps forward and two steps back, but if one takes a long-term view, one can see clear progress. Think back to when the United Nations was established in 1945. Europe lay in ruins, as did Asia. Two nuclear bombs had been dropped on Japan. The Cold War was around the corner and would hold the world in its grip for decades. But the destruction caused by two world wars united the nations of the world in a shared belief that it should never happen again.Franklin D. Roosevelt put it this way in February 1945: â??The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and of danger. The world will either move towards unity and widely shared prosperity or it will move apartâ??. The world of today is indeed a much better world, and not just geopolitically. In 2015 we took stock of the progress we had made on the Millennium Development Goals. Extreme poverty and maternal mortality had been halved, and child mortality had been almost halved. Ninety per cent of children in developing countries are now receiving primary education. Despite all the very real problems that confront us today, I still see grounds for optimism. We cannot change the world overnight, but we can improve the lives of individuals step by step. And we are doing so. The United Nations plays a crucial role in those achievements. The United Nations is the only organization where everyone sits at the table, and remains there. While other institutions struggle with an increasing lack of credibility, faith in the added value of the United Nations remains strong among the worldâ??s citizens. We must not let them down. The Netherlands and its Kingdom partners CuraÃ§ao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have always attached great importance to cooperation within the United Nations. Our small, outward-looking kingdom could not exist without strong multilateral institutions and an effective international legal order. As a trading nation, our prosperity depends on a stable world. And after the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 disaster and attacks in neighbouring countries, the people of the Netherlands are increasingly aware that our domestic security depends on cooperation with other countries. It is very important to the Netherlands and to the victimsâ?? next of kin that justice is seen to be done for those who perished on Flight MH-17. It has been agreed that the next step â?? the prosecution and trial of those responsible â?? will take place in the Netherlands. We are working with all the countries involved to make that possible. The problems confronting todayâ??s world â?? climate change, migration, food security, terrorism and cybercrime â?? are by definition international. No single country can tackle them in isolation. We need each other. Instead of becoming more inward-looking, as united nations we need to take a step outwards. In this turbulent world, the importance of the United Nations is growing every day. Next year, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will be even more focused on the United Nations. In January 2018, we begin our one-year term on the Security Council, taking over from Italy. This shared arrangement is a good example of European partnership within international organizations. We would like to see more such cooperation. Our two countries even share some of the same priorities, such as tackling people-smuggling in Libya, an issue that is of great concern to the whole of Europe. For next year, as a temporary member of the Security Council, we have set three priorities: a strong United Nations and a secure and sustainable world. We will work in a transparent way to achieve that goal, each element of which is equally important. The first priority, a strong United Nations, is essential. For that, reform and modernization are crucial. As the new Secretary-General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, has said, â??The onus falls on the United Nations to prove its worthâ??. He has been active from day one, working to adapt the United Nations to new realities. His ambitious agenda inspires confidence for the future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports his vision and approach, and I would like to take this opportunity to call for a joint effort to implement his reform plans. It is time to follow through. And I do not only mean the Secretary-General, but all of us here in 17-29395 15/29 this great Hall. Saying that the onus falls on the United Nations means that the onus falls on us. The Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to see a more effective and efficient United Nations, with better cooperation among the various agencies. After all, the fields in which the United Nations is active â?? human rights, peace and security, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) â?? are all inextricably linked. The Netherlands already works in this way. We call it the 3-D approach: an integrated effort to tackle development, defence and diplomacy. We would also like to see the role of the Resident Coordinator reinforced. Moreover, the United Nations will have to work in a results-oriented way, adopt a more modern personnel policy and bolster its internal transparency and accountability. Those are all issues that we will press for in the coming period. Our second priority next year is of course security. The key word here is â??preventionâ??. We are not devoting enough attention to the early stages of conflict development. That has to change. We need an organization equipped and ready for action at all stages of conflict. That is already happening in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), in which the Netherlands is participating and will continue to participate in 2018. What is new is that we are using intelligence to carry out long-range reconnaissance missions. In that way, we can anticipate conflict, instead of waiting for it to come our way. We see MINUSMA as a model for future missions. However, we need not only better intelligence, but also task-oriented training for United Nations personnel, high-grade equipment and a clear mandate. This year the Kingdom of the Netherlands is co-organizing the United Nations Peacekeeping Conference in Vancouver. There, we will press for rotation schedules to ensure timely deployment and rotation of both personnel and materiel. That will make countries more willing to participate and extend the potential lifespan of a mission. Counter-terrorism is another issue on which the United Nations is rightly focusing more and more. After all, the United Nations is the prime forum for global norm-setting and international cooperation in the field. When it comes to preventing terrorism, cooperation is key. A good example of such cooperation is the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF), which the Netherlands co-chairs together with Morocco. There, 29 countries work together to achieve a single goal: to keep our citizens safe. It is producing concrete results. For instance, at least 60 countries and the United Nations now contribute foreign terrorist profiles to INTERPOL. INTERPOL already has over 16,000 profiles. When the GCTF was set up, it had fewer than 1,000. That work is not high profile â?? most of it goes on behind the scenes â?? but it saves many lives. The prevention of violence and conflict ties in with our third priority â?? sustainability â?? and with it, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs precede everything I have just discussed. They are the ultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair â?? development and lasting peace, all in one package. The Netherlands and its Kingdom partners CuraÃ§ao, Aruba and Sint Maarten are working together to implement the SDGs. We believe that the key to success in attaining the Goals is our willingness to form partnerships at the national and international levels with businesses, civil society organizations, knowledge institutions, local authorities and youth organizations. Working together across sectors is part of our countryâ??s tradition. Our most important area of expertise is water management. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level, so we have centuries of experience in water technology, urban delta management and maritime technology, expertise that we are keen to share with the rest of the world. Working together on water issues is more crucial than ever before. Nearly five years have elapsed since thousands of people here in New York had to flee their homes when the streets flooded in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The destruction caused by Harvey in Texas and the floods in Asia show that water issues have only become more urgent in the last five years. The impact of climate change on the water cycle is brought home to us every day, all over the world, sometimes violently. The people of Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom, are struggling to cope with the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma. The United Nations now predicts that 200 million people will have become displaced by 2050 because of climate change. Water therefore plays a key role in achieving almost all of the SDGs. We learn most by working with others and by sharing knowledge. We deploy our expertise all over the world â?? for example, in projects in Viet Nam, Peru, Myanmar and Bangladesh. That is one of the reasons that I am a member of the High-level Panel on Water. This Hall, this building and all members of the Assembly represent one of the greatest achievements of humankind: all the nations working together in partnership to foster peace, justice and development in the world. This is a unique Organization, which entails a heavy responsibility. In such turbulent times, the United Nations needs to prove its worth more than ever. Adlai Stevenson, an American politician who experienced two world wars and died when the Cold War was at its height, once said, â??The United Nations is like a spade; it is not self- operating. It is what we make of it, for purposes that we can find in common with our neighbours in the world.â?? I could not agree more. We face great problems in the present age. Conflict and natural disasters affect the lives of many and cause widespread concern. In this unstable world, the United Nations represents stability and a chance to shape the world for the good. We need to make progress with the reforms proposed by Secretary-General Guterres. Let us consider what we have achieved in recent decades. As they say, past results are no guarantee of future performance, but they do represent a promise for the future. Let us do all we can to make good on that promise, because together we can make the United Nations a success. In the year ahead, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will commit itself fully to that endeavour.",1,196
7831,Session 72 - 2017,NOR_72_2017.txt,NOR_72_2017,72,2017,NOR,"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. The world has experienced unprecedented progress during the past decades. Extreme poverty has been more than halved, people live longer, child mortality rates are falling, and more girls attend school that ever before. Global and political cooperation, trade and shared rules of the road have brought us to where we are today. I would like to highlight four building blocks that are crucial for a sustainable future. The first is that our core interests are common to us all, and we can achieve more when we act together. The second is that there can be no security without development and no development without security. The first universal road map for development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is premised on that holistic perspective. The third is that our security and welfare depend on our ability to uphold international law. Good global and national governance and the rule of law are decisive for sustainable development. The fourth is that protectionism and isolationism will put our shared development into reverse. We need more trade and cooperation, not less. We cannot afford to shake the very foundations that our open, global economic order is based on. It is vital that we demonstrate our shared commitment to a rules-based, multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. The WTO remains our best chance of creating a level playing field. We will all benefit from open, predictable and enforceable rules and commitments for all. It will be crucial to achieve a substantive outcome at the WTOâ??s Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires in December. That will be the litmus test. As nations, our core interests are shared. We all want peace, security and welfare for our citizens. We have only one planet, and every nationâ??s and every citizenâ??s security and welfare depend on our ability to protect our natural environment and climate. We cannot allow inaction and unsustainable practices to prevail. The good news is that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have given us a universal development agenda. The Sustainable Development Summit, which took place in this Hall two years ago, represented a pinnacle of global governance and a defining moment for our common future. At that Summit, world leaders decided to put sustainability first. Preventing and addressing war, conflict and humanitarian crises are crucial to sustainability. Norway strongly supports Secretary-General Guterresâ??s vision for the United Nations. Every tool and institution within the United Nations system must be realigned to improve our ability to prevent conflict and make and sustain peace. Respect for fundamental human rights is critical if we are to build resilient, prosperous and peaceful societies. Investing in human rights today will prevent conflicts tomorrow. I would like to draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and the then Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. It came about as a result of the courage and hard work of the parties, supported by international partners and a united Security Council. Norway is proud to have contributed to the process as a guarantor. The point I want to make is that the Colombian success story is propelling sustainable development forward both within and outside the nationâ??s borders. The Final Agreement between the parties also addresses issues of general global interest, such as fighting illicit drug trafficking and deforestation in former conflict areas. The Colombian process has been the most inclusive peace process in history. Ensuring inclusivity in conflict resolution is both the right and the smart thing to do, and experience shows that womenâ??s participation in peace processes tends to increase the chances of sustainable peace. Stability in the Middle East and North Africa is another issue of common interest to the international community, and it will be crucial to achieve regional stability, improve Statesâ?? capacity to govern and increase cooperation between States in the region. The Norwegian leadership of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee donor group for Palestine is an example of how institutional and economic development can underpin efforts to resolve a conflict politically. Development assistance should play a more catalytic role in our shared global campaign for sustainable development by building capacity for generating domestic revenue, strengthening the delivery of public services, stimulating trade and job-creating investments and enabling individuals to take responsibility for their future into their own hands. That is why investing in education, particularly for girls, is the most effective way of promoting sustainable development, and why we are working hard to promote education globally. Norway has doubled its aid to global education over the past four years. Education creates stability and hope for children and young people in conflict areas. Preventing gaps in childrenâ??s education is also important for post-conflict reconstruction and development. That is why Norway has significantly increased its contribution to education in emergencies, with 8 per cent of our humanitarian budget now dedicated to education. Norway has helped to initiate the Education Cannot Wait fund, whose purpose is to facilitate global funding to keep children in school during conflicts and crises. Schools must also be protected from attacks, which is why Norway has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration and encourages others to do the same. Further increases in both domestic and external financing will be needed if we are to attain SDG 4, on quality education for all. Last year, the Education Commission, initiated and supported by Norway, delivered a report with recommendations for increasing financing for education, including funding for the Global Partnership for Education, Education Cannot Wait and a new initiative, the International Finance Facility for Education. Norway has doubled its support for global education through the Global Partnership over the past four years, and we are committed to working with partners to ensure that the funding for it is successfully replenished. The fight against terrorism is a core interest that we all share. Groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) cannot be allowed to challenge our free and open societies. Together we are making decisive progress against ISIL in Syria and Iraq, and we can now look forward to a time when ISIL will be defeated territorially. Norway is making significant contributions to the international coalition in every wayit can, and we are also providing humanitarian relief to those affected. We have disbursed $500 million for the Syria crisis since 2016, which means that we are on track to fulfil the pledge we made at the London donor conference. We must now strengthen our efforts to secure sustainable peace in those areas, and the Security Council must step up and take responsibility. We should increase our efforts to alleviate other large-scale humanitarian crises, such as those in Yemen, South Sudan and the Lake Chad basin. We also need a strong, unified Security Council to help us deal with the North Korean nuclear-weapon programme and ballistic-missile tests. A political solution will be crucial to ensuring the security of us all. Our shared commitment to sustainable development includes the commitment to leaving no one behind. Norwayâ??s humanitarian assistance this year, which amounts to approximately $650 million, supports that cause. Today 142 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, the highest number since the end of the Second World War. Many of the current humanitarian crises are conflict- related, and it is more important than ever to ensure the protection of civilians in such circumstances. We are very concerned about the lack of respect being shown for international humanitarian law. We underline the obligation of all the parties to a conflict to protect civilians and ensure safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need. Norway is working actively to strengthen respect for international humanitarian law among parties to armed conflicts. Putting sustainability first means acting together to save the oceans. We applaud the Secretary-General for appointing the first-ever Special Envoy for the Ocean. We congratulate Mr. Lajcakâ??s predecessor as President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, on his appointment to that important job and wish him every success in galvanizing global efforts to protect the worldâ??s oceans. If we are to be able to harvest resources from the oceans in the future, we must ensure that they are clean and healthy. And it is important for small island developing States â?? also known as large-ocean States â?? to join forces to find good solutions that promote the health and sustainability of our oceans. It was against that backdrop that Norway hosted a meeting at the United Nations this week to explore the enormous range of opportunities that sustainable oceans can provide. In conclusion, the United Nations is the backbone of our global order, and we need a strong and healthy back to address and resolve the challenges the world is facing today. We know that we can do it together. The United Nations provided the leadership that united the countries of the world through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was an important step towards ensuring the sustainability of our planet. We were also able to come together in Addis Ababa in 2015 and agree on a framework for financing sustainable development, which will be crucial to our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. There are many shared challenges that still have to be solved, while at the same time we must safeguard all that we have already accomplished together. Those are the tasks that we have to tackle together in the General Assembly. Norway has actively supported the United Nations since it was founded. Through seven decades and changing Norwegian Governments, we have worked tirelessly in and with the United Nations for our common interests. Norway is a candidate for membership in the Security Council for the period from 2021 to 2022, and we are counting on the support of the States Members of the United Nations for our candidature.",1,196
7832,Session 72 - 2017,NPL_72_2017.txt,NPL_72_2017,72,2017,NPL,"I bring to the General Assembly warm greetings from the people and the Government of Nepal, the land of Lord Buddha and Mount Everest, as well as best wishes for the success of this session. I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I pledge my full support to you as you discharge your important responsibilities. I also wish to put on record our appreciation for your predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his sterling leadership. I wish to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as the Secretary-General. We extend to him our best wishes and full support, including for his efforts aimed at reforming the Organization to make it fit for purpose. I also commend his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his dynamic leadership of the Organization during his two terms of office. It has been more than two decades since I first addressed the Assembly from this rostrum (see A/50/PV.37). In the decades that followed, the world witnessed a profound transformation. While there have been some notable achievements in poverty reduction, school enrolment, gender equality and in combating communicable diseases, those successes have not come without multiple and complex challenges. The world has become more interdependent and better connected, and growing interdependence and pluralism have unleashed both challenges and opportunities. A large geopolitical transformation is still in the making. The rise of inward-looking tendencies in some nation States, marked by a tide of populism on both the left and the right, has created confusion in the course of world politics. The global community today is facing a more complex and polarized environment than before, with multiple transnational challenges ranging from terrorism, climate change and energy deficiency to food insecurity, mass migration and extremism. Ethnic tensions and intra-State conflicts have taken their toll on millions of innocent lives, while the suffering of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen continues unabated. Unfortunately, our efforts to help have been too little and often too late. All of those challenges reinforce the role and responsibility of the United Nations. As we embark upon the path of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, those challenges are the litmus test for our leadership. The choice of the theme for our deliberations at this session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, provides a clear direction to follow. However, the path to peace and a decent life for all will remain elusive without the resources and commitment needed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. Delivering on commitments, making the process inclusive, coordinating efforts and shared responsibilities and backing up our efforts with adequate resources are all essential if we are to secure a sustainable future and ensure that no one is left behind. The vicious race to acquire weapons of mass destruction continues to threaten the world. Nepal calls for time-bound general and complete disarmament. Nepal welcomes the confidence-building measures on conventional weapons that ended nearly two decades of stalemate in the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Nepal signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a step towards nuclear disarmament. Nepal deplores the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s continued defiance of the repeated calls made by the Security Council and the international community. We urge the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to abide by all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We believe that this approach alone will safeguard peace and promote stability on the Korean peninsula. As host to the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal emphasizes the need to reactivate regional disarmament deliberations under the Kathmandu process. Terrorism is a curse on humankind and todayâ??s biggest threat to democracy and development. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations everywhere in the world. The world must come together to address not just the symptoms of terrorism but also its root causes. An early conclusion of a global anti-terrorism convention is the call of our times. Having contributed more than 130,000 peacekeepers to United Nations peacekeeping operations in some of the most challenging situations, we have shown a true commitment to the success of such operations. Nepal is prepared to continue to provide troops and civilian personnel for this noble cause. Nepal hosts a world- class peacekeeping training centre, the oldest in the region. The United Nations can make the best use of that facility by helping to develop it as a regional centre of excellence for peacekeeping training. Nepal firmly believes that all troop- and police-contributing countries should be given a fair opportunity to serve in leadership positions, both in the field and at Headquarters, commensurate with their level and length of contribution. The protection of civilians should be at the centre of peacekeeping operations. Nepal believes that protecting the safety and security of peacekeepers is key to enhancing their ability to deliver from the highest possible moral ground. On sexual exploitation and abuse, we must move from zero tolerance to the zero-case scenario. It is in that spirit that Nepal endorsed the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians in their entirety and signed the Secretary-Generalâ??s Voluntary Compact on Preventing and Addressing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. The Constitution of Nepal accommodates the aspirations of all of its citizens. It guarantees a comprehensive set of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are fully committed to the promotion and protection of those rights and to their being fully enjoyed by our people. The Constitution establishes powerful commissions to promote and protect the specific rights and interests of women, Dalits, Muslims, Madhesis, indigenous people and other disadvantaged communities. The National Human Rights Commission, an independent constitutional body, is responsible for comprehensively monitoring the human rights situation in the country and investigating violations. Nepal views the right to life as the most important of all human rights. Nepalâ??s Constitution bans the death penalty in all circumstances. As a party to 24 international human rights instruments, including seven out of nine core instruments, Nepal has been fulfilling its international obligations with all sincerity and to the best of its ability. Against that backdrop, Nepal has presented its candidature for membership in the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term. Nepalâ??s first-ever election to the Human Rights Council would be an acknowledgement of our long-standing commitment to, and contributions in, the field of human rights. It would also encourage us to do more at the national and global levels. We seek the invaluable support of all Member States for Nepalâ??s candidature. Nepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, regional and international levels to ensure that the migration process creates a fair, win-win situation for all. We call for the safety, security, dignity and well- being of all migrant workers. Although not a party to the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Nepal has earnestly upheld humanitarian principles by hosting thousands of refugees. Mrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates), Vice-President, took the Chair. Protecting minorities and their rights makes the world more humane and contributes to world peace and stability. The forced eviction of citizens is a grave crime against humanity. We call on the international community to respond responsibly and act decisively in all circumstances in support of the right of refugees to return safely to their homelands with dignity and with the hope of rapid reintegration. The cost in terms of human tragedy and devastation caused by natural disasters is increasing sharply. We call for greater global cooperation and coordination in prevention, mitigation and recovery. The trauma of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal has not yet subsided. Post- disaster reconstruction remains ongoing. We thank our neighbours, development partners, other friendly countries and the United Nations family for their generous support in our drive to rebuild. Poor and vulnerable countries suffer disproportionately from climate change despite their negligible greenhouse-gas emissions. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change should be implemented in coordination with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The least developed countries represent the most vulnerable group of countries. They must not be perennially equated with dehumanizing conditions of poverty and underdevelopment. Rather, they must be empowered to smoothly and sustainably graduate to higher standards of living at an early date. As the cost of trade is higher for landlocked developing countries than for coastal countries, developing multimodal-transport infrastructure and providing unhindered transit rights to landlocked nations is critical to their sustainable development. We call for the full implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action, the Vienna Programme of Action and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in order to benefit from the potential synergies, in coordination with the 2030 Agenda. The essence of Nepalâ??s foreign policy is Panchsheel â?? the five principles of peaceful coexistence that are derived from the teachings of Lord Buddha, the enlightened son of Nepal. Those principles serve as the foundations for managing harmonious relations among nations at a time of increasing uncertainty and turmoil. We also believe in non-alignment. In exercising our independent foreign policy, we judge every issue on its merit without fear or favour. We consider regional cooperation to be an important means of building trust and confidence among nations and making the best use of complementarities for shared prosperity. Connectivity remains at the core of deeper integration and the creation of win-win situations. Nepal firmly believes in the indispensability of the United Nations in multilateral affairs and global governance. All countries, particularly the major Powers, are responsible for contributing to the global good by fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities. The reform of the Security Council is long overdue. The underrepresentation of developing countries in the Council must be addressed in recognition of their growing contributions to shaping the global agenda. Reform must be inclusive and representative in structure, transparent and efficient in procedure and accountable and effective in delivery. The Secretary- Generalâ??s reform proposals are a step in the right direction. We believe a clear statement of support from Member States, such as the political declaration for United Nations reform issued earlier this week, helps make the Organization more fit for purpose. Any repositioning of the United Nations development agenda should address gaps, build synergy and improve accountability, while steering clear of the politicization of development under any guise. Nepal supports the revitalization exercise in the General Assembly with a view, inter alia, to more streamlined functions and fairer gender and geographical representation in senior United Nations positions. Before concluding, I would like to share some insights into recent developments in Nepal. Our peaceful transition to democracy after a decade-long armed conflict demonstrates the power and promise of dialogue and negotiation as compared to the perils of violent methods for obtaining political control. The national peace process that began in 2006 concluded with the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive Constitution in 2015, through a popularly elected constituent Assembly. This unique peace process was home-grown and nationally driven. Its successful conclusion firmly established the culture of dialogue and accommodation in Nepal and could serve as a model for similar situations elsewhere. We appreciate the support and understanding that the international community provided. Proportional representation of all sectors of our society is at the core of Nepalâ??s inclusive democracy. Recent local elections firmly established the role of women in politics and development. The Constitution guarantees that 40 per cent of representation at the local level and one third of representatives in the federal and provincial parliaments are women. After the successful holding of local elections, dates have been announced for the first provincial and federal parliamentary elections in 20 years, in two monthsâ?? time. The ongoing transitional justice process combines the reality on the ground with our international commitment to delivering justice and sustaining peace. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Nepalâ??s profound commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Organization comprises large and small nations, and the vast majority of its membership comes from smaller countries, which confirms the universality and legitimacy of the world body. But a platform for a peaceful, stable, rules-based and just world order cannot be erected without addressing our genuine concerns for security, development and well-being. We believe that small nations have been sincere and serious in discharging their responsibilities as Members of the Organization. Even with their meagre economic and security resources, they have played a constructive role in it to promote peace, security and cooperation under very difficult circumstances in many parts of the world. I would like to recall the wise words of Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, who, in addressing the fifteenth session of the General Assembly, in 1960, said, â??Our physical strength may be negligible, but our moral strength, if we are true to ourselves and to the peoples for whom we speak, may be greatâ??  That statement is as relevant today as it was then. Let us collectively display our wisdom, knowledge and capacity to address the pressing issues of peace, security, disarmament and sustainable development with due respect for the internationally accepted rules in order to ensure a safe and stable world order.",1,196
7833,Session 72 - 2017,NRU_72_2017.txt,NRU_72_2017,72,2017,NRU,"It is an honour to be here for the opening of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your recent assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. Please be assured of my delegationâ??s full support and cooperation as you steer its work during this critical session. I would also like to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his exceptional work. At this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest sorrow and condolences to our brothers and sisters who have suffered so much from the series of hurricanes in the Caribbean and the United States and to our brothers and sisters in Mexico for the devastating earthquakes. Their suffering and grief is shared by us all, and we pray that God will be their strength and great provider during their recovery efforts. The Government of Nauru shares the international communityâ??s view that full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be at the centre of our work in the coming year. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a universal agreement representing our collective priorities, from the largest to the smallest nations among us. Bringing that same approach to our implementation effort is the only way to ensure that no country is left behind. Members will recall the five words that guided our work on the SDGs â?? people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership â?? which, I am sure, gave inspiration to the Presidentâ??s choice of a theme for this new session of the General Assembly. Those five words are broad enough to encompass our collectively held ideals while accommodating our tremendous diversity. In the case of Nauru, our status as a small island developing State underlies every aspect of the lives of my people. The global economic system was not created with small islands in mind. Small size and population, geographic isolation, few natural resources and a high level of vulnerability to economic and environmental shocks are among the characteristics that make small islands a special case for development. Our people crave prosperity just like anyone else. However, the well trodden pathways to development are simply not available to us. More than most, our prospects depend on a stable planet, including a safe climate and healthy oceans. That is why Nauru was among the first countries in the world to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and why we have made the implementation of our national contribution to the Agreement our top priority. Nearly every country has made that solemn commitment, and we are now two years closer to the time when we will be held to account. With regard to climate action in developing countries, implementation is a collective responsibility. As developing countries, we have demonstrated our political will to be part of the global effort, but most of us lack the resources to fully implement our contributions alone. In that regard, we call on our development partners to step up their assistance programmes. Nauruâ??s climate priorities fall into four categories â?? renewable energy, land rehabilitation, water security and infrastructure-proofing. We are looking to build genuine and durable partnerships to achieve those objectives. While the Paris Agreement was a historic diplomatic achievement, we must remember that we remain well off track for achieving its central goal of keeping warming below 1.5Â°C. Failure to achieve that goal would be devastating for small islands, but we should not pretend that any additional warming is safe. Negative impacts in the form of superstorms, irregular rain patterns and heatwaves are here with us now and will continue to get worse for the foreseeable future. As I said at last yearâ??s World Humanitarian Summit, all of us must face up to some very difficult questions. How will we feed a planet of 9 billion people when crop yields are projected to fall? How will we share declining freshwater resources as glaciers disappear and drought becomes commonplace in many regions? How will we protect the millions who are rendered homeless when low-lying coastal areas are inundated? How can those and many other challenges be managed effectively so that we can avoid breakdowns in governance and a proliferation of failed States? It is difficult to see how we can realize our vision for a peaceful planet without answers to those questions. Climate change will be the defining security challenge of the century, and we are simply not prepared for life on a hotter planet. For that reason, Nauru supports the proposal by the Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) that the United Nations appoint a Special Representative on climate and security, whose work must begin with an assessment of the United Nationâ??s capacity to respond to climate disasters. In addition to a safe climate, the prosperity of Nauruâ??s people depends on a healthy ocean. In that regard, we must show ambition in tackling the mounting threats to the health of our oceans. The special case of SIDS needs to be enshrined in our work across all ocean sectors and in the new implementing agreements on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Launching and concluding an intergovernmental conference to draft a new implementing agreement in line with the common heritage of mankind that would allow for the protection and preservation of the oceans should be an urgent priority in that work. The security of our oceans is another problem that all of us must tackle. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is another great threat and represents an economic loss to our small economy. Along with transnational crimes that occur within our waters and those of our neighbours, it is an issue that requires cooperation on a number of fronts through inter-agency and intercountry partnerships. I call on our friends and partners to continue with existing programmes, such as the Shiprider Agreement and other ongoing bilateral cooperation arrangements negotiated by the United States, as well as the maritime surveillance programmes provided by Australia and New Zealand. We look forward to partnering with other law-enforcement agencies throughout the Asia-Pacific and beyond. In order for the people of Nauru to benefit from those global efforts to protect the climate and ocean, we will have to build genuine and durable partnerships that are based on mutual respect and a clear understanding of the real needs on the ground. Too often, small countries like mine have been excluded from international programmes. Funding mechanisms can be effectively impossible to access because the application and reporting requirements exceed the capacity of our domestic institutions. Private investment is unreliable and rarely available to support the provision of basic services and the construction of critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the most promising financing models for small developing countries, such as direct access and direct budgetary support, are rarely offered by our development partners. That must change. We need our partners to meet the needs of small and vulnerable countries. We know that we too must become better partners, which is why my country has emphasized the importance of capacity-building as a critical component of our international cooperation. In order for our people to prosper, we must invest in building their knowledge and skills. There is no shortage of workshops held in the Pacific region. What Nauru needs is a sustained capacity-building effort that is backed by real resources, including the long-term, in-country presence of our development partners when appropriate, so that we are left with strong domestic institutions run by a skilled domestic workforce. I cannot stress the importance of a robust capacity- building programme enough. As a former schoolteacher, I am passionate about the importance of high-quality education for my people. We have our own training programmes for our high school and tertiary students, as well as programmes for those already in the workforce. We acknowledge the generous support of our friends and partners, who have provided scholarships and technical workshops that are invaluable to our long- term development, particularly in high-priority areas such as the health sector, education, engineering, public administration and good governance. Having a healthy economy and a productive people also requires international relations to be peaceful and stable, not only in the Pacific but throughout the world. With regard to the Pacific region, Nauru calls on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to enter into dialogue with the other countries involved in the dispute on the Korean peninsula. The threats made against the Republic of Korea, Japan, Guam and cities of the United States do not help the situation, and they potentially put many small countries in the Pacific, including Nauru, in the line of fire. That is completely unacceptable, and the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea must stop such threats, including the launching of rockets into the Pacific Ocean. Further to the south, we have in Taiwan a State that is peaceful, prosperous and happy. Taiwan has the technical and financial capacity to contribute to world peace and development, particularly where its technical prowess and know-how are concerned. It wishes to contribute and participate freely through the partnerships and activities of the United Nations system, including the Sustainable Development Goals, the World Health Organization, UNESCO, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other United Nations-related agencies and activities. In order to ensure that the Taiwanese people can make positive contributions to societies around the world, they must be given the freedom to travel where they choose. We are, after all, a world that calls for inclusiveness and for no one to be left behind. In that same spirit, Nauru renews its call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba. The phrase â??people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnershipâ?? elegantly captures the scope of our work over the coming year and beyond. However, there is another word that begins with P that we must not ignore. That word is power. Power will determine whether resources are mobilized for people or for profiteering. Power will determine whether the voices of the marginalized are heard. Power will determine whether we leave a healthy and bountiful planet for future generations. To ignore the role of power in shaping our future is to cede what little power we may have. If we are to achieve our ambitious goals for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable planet, we will have to grapple with power as it actually exists in the world, including all of its inequities and perversities. That will undoubtedly be the most difficult aspect of the task before us. In closing, I would like to thank the Governments of Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the Russian Federation, the European Union, Italy, Israel, Cuba, the Republic of Korea and the United States for their continued support and assistance to Nauru. We value their friendship very much, and we look forward to their continued cooperation and support. Along those lines, I would like to make a special acknowledgement to the United Nations for the support it provided to Nauru nearly 50 years ago, leading to our independence. On 31 January 2018, we will celebrate our golden jubilee as a sovereign and democratic nation. I would also like to thank all the countries that supported us in exercising our self-determination and achieving our independence.",1,196
7834,Session 72 - 2017,NZL_72_2017.txt,NZL_72_2017,72,2017,NZL,"There is no greater demonstration of the ability of the United Nations to bring the world together than the opening of the General Assembly. The breadth of issues which are discussed in this Hall is immense. Often there are as many points of view as there are Member States, but ultimately we as an Organization share the common goal of making the world more peaceful and improving the lives of all of our peoples. New Zealand is approximately 1,000 kilometres removed from its nearest neighbour in the Pacific, but our international connections are an intrinsic part of our identity and the foundation of our prosperity. We are an outward-looking nation that relies on global stability for our trade and the safety of our people. As a founding Member of the United Nations, New Zealand has always supported the leading role of the United Nations in a multilateral system, which fosters positive international relations. Given the significant ongoing challenges to peace and security, the role of the United Nations in preventing and resolving conflict is as relevant now as ever. Among those challenges, North Korea presents some of the most pressing threats to international security in our time. The North Korean regime has consistently disregarded Security Council resolutions, the wishes of the international community and the well-being of its own people. In this past month alone, it has conducted its sixth nuclear test, launched a ballistic missile over Japan and carried out other ballistic-missile tests. Those provocative actions have directly undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and that has serious wider implications. As we saw during our recent term on the Security Council, the Council works most effectively when it acts as one. New Zealand supports the strong, unified responses by the Security Council, and we stand ready to work with Member States on measures that will fully reflect the consequences of North Koreaâ??s actions. We hope to see tensions defused and a path to dialogue developed. The goal of denuclearization requires eventual engagement with Pyongyang, but any dialogue must be meaningful and constructive, and must address the issues that most concern the international community. Until then, we join the rest of the international community in calling on North Korea to undertake immediate actions to de-escalate tensions, improve its humanitarian situation and abide by its international obligations. The risks associated with nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation have been a key factor in New Zealandâ??s long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament. Last week, we were pleased to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The Treaty represents an important step towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. New Zealand is committed to playing its part to address global threats to peace and security. We have a history of contributing to efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, including through the United Nations. On the Security Council, New Zealand made determined efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria. Alongside Spain, Jordan and Egypt, we managed to renew and improve cross-border access arrangements. We consistently raised concerns about the Councilâ??s failure to bring about a political solution. Unspeakable crimes continue to be committed against the civilian population, and humanitarian access remains fraught. Only a sustainable peace based on an inclusive longterm political settlement can bring that needless conflict to an end. In Iraq, New Zealandâ??s defence force personnel are working to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi forces in their battle against Daâ??esh. We welcome the liberation of Mosul, Tal Afar and Nineveh province. That was an admirable achievement, and we acknowledge the sacrifice and commitment of the Iraqi security forces and Government. We note that the influence of Daâ??esh is not limited to Iraq and Syria, and that the defeat of Daâ??esh there will not spell the end of that group. New Zealand is focused on working with others in our near region â?? the Asia-Pacific â?? to ensure that groups like Daâ??esh do not inflict suffering in the way they have elsewhere. In addition to security-based efforts, preventing and countering violent extremism in the first place is vital, and we are pleased to support international efforts in that regard. New Zealand has been contributing to Afghanistanâ??s stability since 2001. We remain a committed partner of Afghanistan including through the NATO Resolute Support Mission. Ongoing support for Afghanistan from the international community is critical, given the scale and complexity of the challenges ahead, but history has demonstrated in Afghanistan that no amount of international support can by itself bring about lasting peace and security. Afghanistanâ??s future lies in the hands of its Government and people. We continue to call on the National Unity Government to prioritize the interests of the Afghan people above all else. The United Nations is unique in its ability to convene the world so as to tackle problems that require collective action. The speed with which parties ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has demonstrated the strength of commitment to take meaningful action on climate change. New Zealand is among the many countries committed to the Paris Agreement. Progressing the Paris work programme is essential so as to deliver a framework that will ensure that the Agreement is robust, effective and credible, and that collective ambition will increase over time. The Pacific is at the forefront of vulnerability to the effects of climate change. We are therefore pleased to support Fijiâ??s presidency of this yearâ??s Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is a rare opportunity for the region to showcase its leadership in that area. We are an island nation within a vast Pacific Ocean. Our exclusive economic zone is 15 times larger than our land area. The sustainable management of our sea and our islands are of critical importance environmentally, economically and culturally. Small island developing States face unique challenges and vulnerabilities. They are also great- ocean States and stewards of considerable ocean resources. New Zealand wants to assist those States in the sustainable management of oceans to ensure that our oceans are healthy and productive. We are making substantial investments to improve sustainable fisheries management in the Pacific and to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We are also propelling a major increase in renewable energy generation in our region and further afield. New Zealand has taken a lead role in advocating internationally for the reform of fossil-fuel subsidies, which lead to wasteful consumption, put renewable energy at a disadvantage and depress investment in energy efficiency. We are exploiting alternative sources of development financing, including working with the private sector, tapping into the diaspora as a source of skills and investment, maximizing the value of remittances and increasing temporary labour market access. New Zealand is supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in a wide range of areas, both domestically and internationally, including through our development assistance. We will continue to play our part in meeting the high level of ambition set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Pacific is an important part of how we define ourselves internationally. A strong and effective regional architecture, with the Pacific Islands Forum as the central regional body, is a key to Pacific success. New Zealand and was pleased with the outcomes of the recent Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting, which had a strong focus on fisheries and climate change issues. Pacific leaders also agreed on the importance of fully implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions on North Korea, including by de-registering any North Korean trading or fishing vessels currently flagged in Pacific Statesâ?? shipping registries. New Zealand places significant value on the international rules-based order. Widely recognized rules, buttressed by an effective United Nations, are the best guarantors of our security and our economic wellbeing, particularly for small States. Such guarantees are also the best means of ensuring decent treatment and decent conditions for the worldâ??s citizens, and thereby reducing conditions that can lead to unrest, conflict and misery. But we all recognize that the United Nations can do better, and to do so it must be more relevant, effective and fit for purpose. The Secretary-Generalâ??s reform agenda provides an opportunity for us to make that a reality. Important work lies ahead for us to reform the development, peace and security pillars. Another critical element of making the United Nations more effective is management reform, including strengthening and modernizing its recruitment and management processes to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from its people. New Zealand looks forward to working together with the Secretary-General and all Member States. It is our sincere hope that reform can achieve our collective goal of better reflecting the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and, ultimately, ensuring that the United Nations delivers better outcomes for our generation and those to come.",1,196
7835,Session 72 - 2017,OMN_72_2017.txt,OMN_72_2017,72,2017,OMN,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k and his friendly country, the Slovak Republic, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We are confident that his vast experience and competence in the political realm will enable him to steer the work of this session to a successful conclusion. We are also pleased to express our appreciation for his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji, whose efforts during his presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session were commendable. It is an equal pleasure to congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as Secretary-General, and we wish him every success in his noble tasks. We assure him of the Sultanate of Omanâ??s readiness to cooperate with him and all the States Members of the United Nations to achieve the Organizationâ??s lofty goals and objectives, above all the maintenance of international peace and security. Earlier civilizations flourished in parallel with humankindâ??s belief in divine books, which created a set of values and principles for cooperation, coexistence, knowledge and scientific exchange, inter alia. We believe that religious and cultural heritage, along with the values of civilizations, enrich and enhance our understanding of peace. We should therefore not overlook such a heritage since it is an important means for disseminating the culture of peace and coexistence throughout the world. In our foreign policy and international relations, we have adopted an approach that supports peace, coexistence, tolerance, dialogue and close cooperation among all nations and peoples. The Sultanate of Oman is also committed to the principles of righteousness, justice, equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and the peaceful settlement of disputes, based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. This perspective boosts confidence, enhances mutual respect for the sovereignty of States and promotes good- neighbourliness in a way that enables States to maintain security, stability and prosperity. Accordingly, we call upon all States to support peace efforts and to join hands to spread peace as a global culture at all levels. Peace and dialogue are of vital importance for humankind. They are a collective responsibility. The United Nations is vested with the responsibility to lead the effort to foster them. However, the support of the international community is also needed to pursue national and international interests, but this cannot be achieved without giving the United Nations a strong role in protecting the world from conflicts and war. Political and economic conflicts represent a failure of the international community to lend support for the least developed countries, leading to many conflicts and problems, including transcontinental global migration, the spread of chaos, upheavals, troubles and instability in many parts of the world. The economic slowdown and the decrease in global trade have exacerbated these problems, especially in the developing countries, which have been negatively affected by World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. The WTO has had limited ability in achieving its primary goal of building developing Statesâ?? international trade capacities. We believe that the drive of some parties to gain a larger share of global markets or to implement isolationist and protectionist policies aggravates problems and increase tensions throughout the world. Accordingly, we deem it highly important that the international community adopt a new vision that would lead to greater justice and expand common interests, while helping developing nations attain higher levels of sustainable development. This could be achieved if Member States adhered to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and avoided unilateral decisions or policies. The United Nations must once again take the lead in the path towards peace. Its agencies should play a more active role in the development process in order to achieve sustainable development. From this rostrum, we call on all States to exert greater efforts and cooperate to help the United Nations restore its pivotal role in international relations. We also look towards a more vital role for the Secretary- General in the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We support the Secretary- General in his efforts to strengthen and reactivate the role of the Organization in bringing international peace and security to the world. We also call upon the international community to, in a spirit of responsibility and credibility, spread the culture of dialogue and understanding in order to peacefully settle disputes and end tensions in the world. We consider it essential to discover the causes of weakness in international policies and adopt a more effective approach to settling regional and international problems, including climate change and other issues that affect the security and stability in the world. On this basis, we invite the United Nations and the international community to shoulder their responsibilities and strive to achieve peace, prevent conflicts and wars, and settle differences through dialogue and other peaceful means. Accordingly, my country renews its readiness to work with the United Nations to build a new world that is secure and stable. The world is witnessing new transformations in the scientific and technological realms that are affecting peopleâ??s lives. There is also a steady growth in population. Therefore, we stress the need to adopt a new perspective to establish a global partnership that would benefit from such advanced technologies and scientific progress. The global breakthrough in technology achieved through the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is an important gain for humankind. Several natural disasters recently have struck the world, which should convince all States that it is in their interest to adhere to the Paris Agreement. The Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons indicated that the resolution adopted at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference on a the establishment of a zone in the Middle East free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction remains in force until it achieves all its objectives. In that regard, my country supports all international efforts to draft a binding instrument that would cover the loopholes emerging from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This highly important document would help the international community to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. My country denounces terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of its justifications. Based on our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations, which calls for the maintenance of international peace and security, we support all efforts aimed at confronting that scourge by taking the appropriate measures based on the relevant Arab, Islamic and international resolutions, treaties and agreements. The world is facing real challenges that must be countered through a unified stance so as to respond to the aspirations of humankind. We therefore believe that working on the basis of the true meaning of partnership and common destiny among members of the international community is the most appropriate means to achieve such a goal. We wish the General Assembly every success at this session.",1,196
7836,Session 72 - 2017,PAK_72_2017.txt,PAK_72_2017,72,2017,PAK,"I would first like to convey the deepest sympathies of the people and the Government of Pakistan to the people of Mexico, who have been affected by the recent earthquake, and all of those affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Let me then congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I am confident that your long experience in public service and international relations will be an asset in successfully guiding the Assembly to address the imposing challenge of security, development and governance that confront the world today. For over 70 years, despite the Cold War, the nuclear arms race and scores of regional conflicts, our world has been able to avoid a global conflagration. That can be ascribed largely to the adherence by most States to the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, except under the authority of the Charter of the United Nations. Unfortunately, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations have been progressively eroded in the new millennium. In recent years, some countries have displayed a growing proclivity to resort to unilateral force and intervention against other States. Coercion and threats have emerged once again as the main currency in the management of inter-State disputes and differences. Renewed East-West tensions may engulf Europe in another Cold War. Peace and prosperity in Asia are threatened by emerging great Power friction and rising tensions in South, East and West Asia. The Middle East is racked by war and violence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. Although Daâ??esh appears to have been weakened in Iraq and Syria, terrorist violence has spread and intensified across the Middle East and Africa and other parts of the world. There is no end in sight to the tragedy of Palestine. Israelâ??s prolonged occupation and the expansion of illegal settlements may lead to renewed and wider violence in the holy land. The legitimate struggle for self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be brutally suppressed by Indiaâ??s occupation forces. Rising racism and religious hatred, manifested in xenophobia and Islamophobia, is erecting physical walls and psychological barriers among nations and peoples, even as our world becomes increasingly interdependent. The ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas is not just an affront to all norms of humanity but also challenges our collective conscience. While the pillars of world order are being eroded, the imperative of international cooperation â?? the need to address poverty, disease, climate change, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and forced displacement â?? is intensifying. Today, more than ever, we need the United Nations to provide the parameters, processes and platforms for global cooperation, which is essential if we are to address the wide-ranging challenges to peace, security and development. Pakistan welcomes the efforts launched by Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres to revitalize the United Nations capabilities in peace and security, development and management. We are also committed to a reform that transforms the Security Council into a more representative, democratic and accountable organ, rather than an expanded club of the powerful and the privileged. Pakistan celebrated the seventieth anniversary of its independence last month. This month marks the seventieth anniversary of Pakistanâ??s membership in the United Nations. Pakistanâ??s commitment to the principles of the United Nations is evident from the long record of its constructive role in the initiatives and contributions that have shaped the decisions and discourse at the world Organization with regard to decolonization, development, trade, international law, human rights, refugees, peacekeeping, security, disarmament and United Nations budget and management. Pakistan has consistently been one of the worldâ??s top troop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping. We will remain on the front lines of peacekeeping and continue to offer professional and well-trained personnel to the United Nations, despite our own security challenges. Our adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations flows from the declaration of our founding father, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who said that our foreign policy was one of friendliness and goodwill towards all nations of the world. Unfortunately, from day one of its creation, Pakistan has faced unremitting hostility from its eastern neighbour. India refuses to implement the unanimous resolutions of the Security Council, which mandate a United Nations-supervised plebiscite to enable the 8/42 17-29597 people of Jammu and Kashmir to freely decide their destiny. Instead, India has deployed nearly 700,000 troops in occupied Kashmir to suppress the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris to exercise their right to self- determination. That represents the most intense foreign military occupation in recent history. As in the past, the Kashmiri people today are waging a heroic and popular struggle to rid themselves of Indiaâ??s oppressive rule. They come out in the streets daily to call on India to leave Jammu and Kashmir. India has responded with massive and indiscriminate force to suppress the Kashmiris, shooting indiscriminately at children, women and youth. Hundreds of innocent Kashmiris have been killed or injured, and shotgun pellets have blinded and maimed thousands of Kashmiris, including children. Those and other brutalities clearly constitute war crimes and violate the Geneva Conventions. Pakistan demands that an international investigation be conducted into Indiaâ??s crimes in occupied Kashmir. We ask that the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights send an inquiry commission to occupied Kashmir to verify the nature and extent of Indiaâ??s human rights violations, secure the punishment of those responsible and provide justice and relief to the victims. Pakistan also urges the international community to call on India to halt pellet-gun attacks and other violence against unarmed demonstrators, stop the use of rape as an instrument of State policy, end media blackouts, rescind its draconian emergency laws and free all Kashmiri political leaders. To divert the worldâ??s attention from its brutalities, India frequently violates the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir. Despite more than 600 violations since January, Pakistan has acted with restraint, but if India ventures across the Line of Control, or acts upon its doctrine of limited war against Pakistan, it will elicit a strong and matching response. The international community must act decisively to prevent the situation from turning into a dangerous escalation. The Kashmir dispute should be resolved justly, peacefully and expeditiously. As India is unwilling to resume the peace process with Pakistan, we call on the Security Council to fulfil its obligation to secure the implementation of its resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir. To that end, the Secretary-General should appoint a Special Envoy for Jammu and Kashmir. His mandate should flow from the long-standing but unimplemented relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Let me reiterate that Pakistan remains open to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with India aimed at addressing all outstanding issues, especially Jammu and Kashmir, and discussing measures to maintain peace and security. That dialogue must be accompanied by an end to Indiaâ??s campaign of subversion and State-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan, including from across our western border. Apart from the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and its people have suffered the most from four decades of foreign intervention and civil wars in Afghanistan. Those wars have blighted our country with the flow of extremists and terrorists, guns and drugs, as well as an influx of millions of refugees. They have set back our economic development by decades. Even today, Pakistan is host to more than 3 million Afghan refugees. No one desires peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. From the 16 years of ongoing war in Afghanistan, it is clear that peace will not be restored by resorting continuously to military force. Kabul, the Coalition and the Afghan Taliban cannot impose a military solution on one another. The international community â?? as expressed in several United Nations resolutions â?? has concluded that peace can be restored in Afghanistan only through a negotiated settlement. Having suffered and sacrificed so much owing to its role in the global counter-terrorism campaign, Pakistan finds it especially galling to be blamed for the military or political stalemate in Afghanistan. We are not prepared to be anyoneâ??s scapegoat. Taliban safe havens are located not in Pakistan but in the large tracts of territory controlled by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yes, cross-border attacks do occur. They are mostly conducted by anti-Pakistan terrorists from safe havens across the border. In order to end all cross-border attacks, we ask the Afghan Government and the Coalition to support and complement Pakistanâ??s ongoing efforts to strengthen border controls and monitor all movement across it. What Pakistan is not prepared to do is to fight the Afghan war on Pakistanâ??s soil, nor can we endorse any failed strategy that will prolong and intensify the suffering of the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries of the region. Pakistan believes that the urgent and realistic goals in Afghanistan should be: first, to make a concerted effort to eliminate the presence in Afghanistan of Daâ??esh, Al-Qaida and their affiliates, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which was recently declared a terrorist organization by the Security Council; and, secondly, to encourage negotiations between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban â?? within the framework of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group or any other trilateral format â?? to reach a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. Those two steps offer the most realistic prospect of restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan and our region. Pakistanâ??s counter-terrorism credentials cannot be questioned. Following the 9/11 attack on the United States in 2001, it was Pakistani efforts that enabled the decimation of Al-Qaida. Pakistanâ??s military campaigns have succeeded in clearing our tribal areas of almost all militant groups. We took the war to the terrorists. We have paid a heavy price. More than 27,000 Pakistanis, including 6,500 military and law-enforcement personnel, have been martyred by terrorists. Some 50,000 Pakistani nationals have been injured, including 15,000 army personnel, many of whom have lost limbs. We have fought the war against terror with our own resources. Pakistanâ??s economic losses are estimated at more than $120 billion. Yet we remain fully committed to implementing our national action plan against terrorism and extremism. Defeating terrorist violence is vital to realizing our overriding priority of rapid economic and social development. Terrorism is now a global phenomenon that must be addressed comprehensively. We see two major gaps in the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. First, the international community has failed to address the issue of State-sponsored terrorism. That is the instrument of choice of the agents of chaos and aspiring hegemons. In several regions, stability will be difficult to restore unless State-sponsored terrorism is condemned, prohibited and punished. Secondly, in order to eliminate terrorism, its root causes must be addressed, which go beyond poverty and ignorance. Terrorism is rather an extreme response to real or perceived political and/or other grievances, including foreign intervention, oppression and injustice. Unless such root causes are addressed, it will be difficult to counter the twisted narratives of terrorist groups. Confronted by a hostile and increasingly militarized neighbour, Pakistan has been obliged to maintain its capability for credible deterrence. My country developed nuclear weapons only when they were introduced in our region by that neighbour. Our strategic assets are vital in order to deter the frequent threat of aggression. They are tightly and effectively controlled, as has been widely acknowledged by experts. The world community would be well served by enabling Pakistan to join global non-proliferation arrangements, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, on a non-discriminatory basis. Climate change poses a new and existential threat to humankindâ??s future. Extreme climate events are multiplying. Their consequences, such as the flooding in Texas, the landslides in Nepal and Sierra Leone, the devastation wrought by hurricanes in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, and the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers, are global and indiscriminate. As one of the States most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Pakistan believes that it is in our collective interest to pursue and realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and build a new and greener model for growth and development. Growth and development remain the primary goals of developing countries. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals represent the most ambitious development agenda in history. The development challenge has become even more difficult owing to the combined constraints of climate change, increasing protectionism, the deterioration of international cooperation and the proliferation of conflicts. The vision of shared growth spelled out in Chinese President Xi Jinpingâ??s Belt and Road Initiative offers a solid path to prosperity and a model of South- South cooperation worthy of emulation. Pakistanâ??s economy has recorded a remarkable revival over the past four years. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will further contribute to our economic upsurge. That will expand exponentially as the Pakistan-China partnership extends beyond energy and transportation to many other sectors. Pakistanâ??s integration into the Eurasian Belt and Road Initiative will provide a firm foundation for Pakistanâ??s rapid economic development. With a youthful population of 207 million people, we are confident that an economic strategy anchored in rising incomes, consumption and production will propel Pakistan towards greater prosperity. To achieve those priority goals for our people, Pakistan seeks to build peace within our country and security around our borders. We seek good relations with all States on the basis of sovereign equality. We will respond positively to all offers of friendship and cooperation. We are poised at a critical inflection point in history. The world order that has prevented a global war for more than 70 years is under threat. Yet revolutionary advances in science and technology, the immense capacity for global investment, production, consumption and trade, especially in the developing countries, and the availability of structures and mechanisms for collective action offer an opportunity, unprecedented in human history, to address the diverse challenges that we face today. It is here, through the United Nations, that the peoples of the world can seize the opportunities to achieve our shared vision of a more just, peaceful and prosperous world.",1,196
7837,Session 72 - 2017,PAN_72_2017.txt,PAN_72_2017,72,2017,PAN,"I would like to begin my remarks by extending my condolences and solidarity to the people and the Government of Mexico for the victims of the earthquake that struck yesterday, as well as to the peoples of Cuba, the United States and the nations of the Caribbean for the deaths and heavy material damage left in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and now being inflicted by Hurricane Maria, especially in Dominica. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. Such natural disasters send a clear message that we must continue to forge ties of solidarity and that our countriesâ?? protective and security capacities should be used solely to help each other, not to create conflict. I would like to congratulate you, President LajÄ?Ã¡k, on your election to steer the debates at this session of the General Assembly, and to extend warm greetings to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. In my capacity as President of the Republic of Panama, I pledge the support of my Government and country. From this rostrum, with respect and affection, I would also like to send my warmest greetings to the people of Panama, who have given me the opportunity to serve them. For a fourth consecutive year, I am returning to the Assembly as the world is beset by challenges such as organized crime, terrorism and natural disasters that affect all our populations. Another major challenge we must tackle is the increase in migration flows driven by war, poverty and inequality. Against that backdrop, the theme of the Assembly at this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? will encourage Heads of State and Government to engage in dialogue and reach agreement on concrete actions that we can take to bring about peace in the world. Peace is a human construct, the fruit of coexisting respectfully and meeting the basic needs of individuals, responsibly, all the while preserving the planet thatis our home. The most effective and appropriate way to resolve the problems that currently affect the Earthâ??s inhabitants is to ensure that human beings are always central to our decision-making. Such humanitarian policy has been the lodestar of my leadership of Panama for the past 39 months, as I have sought to build a nation where justice and equality prevail, without making innocent people pay the price or causing unnecessary conflict. Democracy is not just about electing Heads of State in free and fair elections. Rather, it is about those of us who are elected understanding that the power bestowed on us should be used only to serve those who elected us; about managing the wealth of the State with transparency, fairness and social justice for the benefit of the people; and about leading our countries peacefully, on a basis of dialogue and consensus. In 2015, in his opening remarks to the seventh Summit of the Americas, Pope Francis said, â??Panamaâ??s geographic position in the centre of the American continent, making it the meeting point between North and South, between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, is surely a call, pro mundi beneficio, to generate a new order of peace and justice and to promote solidarity and cooperation while respecting the just autonomy of each nation.â?? I have always borne in mind Panamaâ??s role as a facilitator of dialogue and understanding. Ours is a country of unity at the service of the international community. We stand ready to cooperate as a strategic ally and to contribute our resources in the interest of addressing the common problems afflicting the region and the world at large. At the Summit of the Americas, which took place in Panama, there was a historic rapprochement between two countries that had held divergent positions for more than half a century â?? Cuba and the United States. They began a frank conversation about putting an end to their estrangement. As we near the next Summit of the Americas, in Lima, we must approach it with a constructive spirit and an openness to dialogue to analyse the problems of the region and uphold peace and unity across the Americas. The Americas and the world are happy to see that Colombia is successfully continuing to implement its Peace Agreement. In his recent visit, Pope Francis delivered an important message about the consolidation of the process â?? which benefits everyone, not just the Colombian people â?? that we must accept the mistakes that have been made, correct them and seek reconciliation. However, our continent is facing a problem that transcends borders â?? the growth of drug production and trafficking. It is vital that the leaders of the Americas unite in joining forces to tackle that challenge, one that threatens the peace of our peoples, particularly in the northern triangle. We cannot allow drug trafficking to disrupt the peace that has been restored at such cost in Central America and Colombia. Drug trafficking condemns our people to poverty; affects State budgets; makes us invest resources in security instead of education, health, housing and transportation; challenges the authority of Governments; and subverts the loyalty of those whose duty it is to comply with and uphold the rule of law. Panama reaffirms its commitment to combating drug trafficking head-on. We will dedicate the full force of our efforts and resources to helping the region to eliminate that scourge. Moreover, we appeal to the leaders and Heads of State of the countries that produce and consume drugs to support us in this fight. Every dollar generated by drug trafficking represents death in our region. The political crisis in Venezuela is having a profound impact on the region. We must stop the clashes that have provoked unnecessary violence, hurting all Latin Americans. It is urgent that we recognize that to resolve the conflict, both sides must seek a path to understanding and agree on a defined road map for free and transparent presidential elections in 2018. It would be a grave error if the Government of Venezuela insisted on installing a one-party political model by force. That would aggravate its social and humanitarian crisis, increasing migratory flows that could result in complex situations in neighbouring countries. We should all stand with the Venezuelan people to help them overcome this crisis. Our continent must emerge united from the Summit of the Americas in Lima if we are to combat inequality and drug trafficking together. In that regard, Panama is willing to play a front-line role, building bridges of understanding and dialogue that can make our region stronger and more united. I call on the Heads of State of the Americas to go to Lima with that vision of unity so that we can ensure that the hemisphere makes steady progress towards development. We live in a world that is being battered by acts of terrorism, natural disasters and organized crime. There is no time or space for us to waste effort fighting over temporary ideological differences. Countries must unite their capacities to address the evils affecting peoples beyond their borders. Panama strongly condemns all acts of terrorism anywhere the world, which can never be justified. Today I respectfully call on the countries that are members of the Security Council to strengthen their measures and decisions promoting sustainable peace in places such as Syria and Iraq. I must also strongly condemn irresponsible leaders, such as those in North Korea, who seek to destabilize peaceful coexistence in the world. Panama believes that a strong multilateral system can be used to achieve the objectives we set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and we are ready to continue playing a leadership role. That is why we support the Secretary-Generalâ??s process of reform designed to make the United Nations more transparent, efficient and better able to respond to the needs of a world of more than 7 billion people. If we can share the wealth of our planet, no one will be left behind. Those reforms must ensure that the United Nations unites us more effectively and connects Heads of State with the pain of people suffering from war, natural disasters and organized crime. Multilateral cooperation is vital to that process, which is not a question merely of economic resources but also of the transfer of capacity and best practices. Middle-income countries such as Panama can contribute to the transfer of knowledge and technology, generating tangible benefits for populations and contributing to peace. Panamaâ??s commitment to that path is unwavering. We therefore call for the establishment of a United Nations regional headquarters in our country. We are willing to build facilities for a centre for regional humanitarian assistance that will enable us to provide timely support, when it is needed, to countries in the region that are dealing with natural disasters, as we did recently with the air and maritime bridges bringing aid to countries affected by Hurricane Irma, which struck Cuba, the Caribbean and the United States. As President of the Republic of Panama, I have two clear goals: to make politics a service and ensure that my country continues as a functional democracy. We are recovering hundreds of millions of misappropriated dollars that belong to the people, and we are investing that money in the people, using the Stateâ??s resources to benefit all Panamanians. Thanks to the honest Government that I lead, the increased revenues from our broadened Canal and the sustained economic growth of the past few years, we are improving the living conditions of all Panamanians. We have significantly increased the salaries of civil servants, police officers, educators, doctors and nurses. We have reviewed the money going into pensions and scholarships and strengthened conditional monetary assistance. We are also laying thousands of kilometres of roads, investing in major basic health projects and water-purifying plants, and building tens of thousands of houses for our poorest citizens, as well as modern, bilingual schools, sports and cultural centres, new metro lines and a modern mass-transport system. We are working towards those objectives with a sense of responsibility and transparency, without increasing any taxes, and moving forward steadily towards fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. That is the value of an honest Government, which, bound by social justice and equality to distribute the riches of the people, represents a road to a peaceful society, a decent quality of life and a fairer world in which we are all treated equally. All human beings deserve a decent life, which takes everyoneâ??s efforts to build and is achieved only when the basic needs of our citizens for food, shelter, health and education are met. That is why it is important to ensure that every citizen pays taxes to the State, as the working and professional classes do. It is Governmentsâ?? duty to take action against tax evasion, which affects the ability of the State to help the poorest and deepens inequality. Rulers must implement public policies and develop programmes that allow the State to distribute resources equitably, so that the most vulnerable are equipped with the tools to contribute to development and use resources sustainably. Countries have to be accountable in the interests of achieving transparency in the administration of State resources. However, it is important to ensure that the misdeeds of the political classes and their supporters in business do not hurt innocent people. The fight against corruption is not measured by the numbers of those who are prosecuted and convicted by the judicial system, but rather by the numbers of those who benefit from a transparent administration of State resources, so that they are recovered for the Stateâ??s use. That is important. Rulers have to defend their countriesâ?? economies and the jobs and projects that benefit the people. Panama is committed to the security and protection of its logistics platforms and financial systems. We continue to work responsibly to prevent illegal activities that undermine the common good. In a world that is constantly talking about justice, we Heads of State and Government must keep in mind that justice means giving all of us what is rightfully ours. Our planet is rich enough for all human beings to have a decent life. The most important value for the inhabitants of the Earth is peace. It is our responsibility to ensure that our actions are always aligned with the pursuit of that goal. May God bless us all and guide us in our work towards a better world.",1,196
7838,Session 72 - 2017,PER_72_2017.txt,PER_72_2017,72,2017,PER,"It is an honour for me to address the General Assembly and congratulate the President on his election, and to express our willingness to contribute to the success of his term. I wish first of all to emphasize Peruâ??s commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, to international peace and security, to sustainable development and to human rights, and to the achievement of sustainable peace. For that, we need to strengthen multilateralism, dialogue and cooperation. For Peru, the United Nations is essential for building a peaceful and sustainable future, facing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism or corruption, and strengthening international governance in order to obtain a more humane, open and inclusive globalization. Peru is preparing to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the biennium 2018-2019. Our vocation for peace and respect for international law, effective collective security and adherence to the peaceful settlement of disputes will be the guiding principles of our action. We are a developing country that has suffered terrorism at first hand. We are a firm defender of human rights and a promoter of democracy and the rule of law. We will give special attention to consolidating sustainable peace and preventing conflicts and humanitarian crises. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the possible access of terrorist groups to them are real threats. That is why we have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and we hope that all States possessing such weapons will adhere to that instrument. We condemn the nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which today constitute the greatest threat to international peace and security. In the Security Council, we will support efforts to resume the Six-Party Talks in order to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. Peru reaffirms its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and its implementation. Our country is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which is seen in ocean warming, shrinking glaciers and the impact on the availability of water resources, the loss of biodiversity and other extreme phenomena. Climate change is a real threat that knows no borders. So far this year Peru has suffered from the rain and flooding of the coastal El Nino, and the Caribbean and the United States have suffered a series of devastating hurricanes. That is why we support the initiative of President Emmanuel Macron of France to establish a Global Pact for the Environment. Peru is also committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Accordingly, we presented our first voluntary national review in July, reporting on our progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda in line with our national priorities, circumstances and needs. Peru promotes, from a focus on rights, a social revolution aimed at eradicating poverty through quality public services. Ensuring access to water and sanitation is the first priority of our Government, which accounts for the participation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in the High-level Panel on Water. In line with the 2030 Agenda, we believe that corruption is also a global threat, one that erodes democratic governance and legal stability in our countries, diverts resources needed to finance development, generates disenchantment and mistrust in institutions and increases inequality. Aware of the need to confront that scourge together, Peru has proposed that democratic governance and the fight against corruption be the central themes of the Summit of the Americas to be held in Lima next April, with a view to adopting concrete measures to strengthen institutions and combat impunity. The adoption of the standards and good practices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development â?? which Peru aspires to join before 2021, the year of our bicentennial as an independent nation â?? will also contribute to strengthening our institutions and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals Peruvians believe that democracy is indispensable for stability, peace, development and the defence and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Guided by that conviction, my country led the process that culminated in the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter in 2001. In our region, democracy is an inalienable right, which is why Peru remains profoundly concerned with the rupture of the democratic order and humanitarian crisis happening in Venezuela, as well as by the infringements on and abuses of citizens that have been reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The solution to the grave crisis in Venezuela must be peaceful and be negotiated by the Venezuelans themselves. Any attempt, internal or external, to resort to force violates the principles of theCharter of the Organization and undermines genuine interest in defending democracy and respect for the rule of law, both domestically and internationally. Along those lines, the Lima Group believes that the initiative of the Dominican Republic to bring together the Government and the opposition should be developed with good faith, rules, objectives, clear deadlines and guarantees of compliance, for which international accompaniment is essential. To conclude, I wish to convey to the General Assembly that Peru will continue to work constructively to solve the problems we face and to bring about the future that our peoples long for and deserve.",1,196
7839,Session 72 - 2017,PHL_72_2017.txt,PHL_72_2017,72,2017,PHL,"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. The path to peace must be walked with patience. In order to achieve any purpose with others, be they Powers or people, patience is needed. The opposite of patience is impatience, which is the cause and aggravation of conflict. Someone said that to jaw-jaw is better than to war-war. Listening is even better than talking. We must listen to others more than we listen to ourselves. Hopefully, we know what we are talking about, but others may know what we do not. We can learn only if we stop talking and listen. We may think that we know how others can do things better than they themselves have done it. Maybe our way is more efficient. But the time gained by that efficiency will be time lost convincing others that our way is better, rather than reaching a compromise between our way and theirs. Real change in the world order necessitates cooperation. Nothing affecting others can be undertaken without their willing involvement and getting their agreement on the purpose and manner of the change. Achieving a shared purpose beyond any single personâ??s ability requires cooperation. But how else can we get cooperation, if not with the patience to explain why it is needed and the equal patience to listen? That is why we have the United Nations, the largest cooperative endeavour in human history. We use the United Nations to speak out, but more importantly to listen. And somehow, we arrive at a consensus or at the very least a modus vivendi on how to proceed in peace and, therefore, with greater prospects for progress. The theme for this yearâ??s session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, captures a promise that everyone who has stood here has vowed to fulfil for his or her own people, as well as for the rest of the peoples of the United Nations, as the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations puts it. Yet, after 72 years, while much has been achieved, much more has to be done. The promise is still very much a work in progress. We, the peoples of the United Nations, battle new threats that undermine the success that we have achieved and frustrate progress in peace, development and human rights â?? the three pillars of the United Nations. The theme mirrors the Philippinesâ?? own people- centred agenda, as articulated by our President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. President Duterte and the Filipino people are committed to real change in order to finally carry out long-needed reforms, address long-ignored national threats and protect the human rights of all Filipinos while doing our part to attain regional peace and stability. We remain true to our obligations under the international treaties we have ratified. We have made many sacrifices as a nation and as a people, and we shall continue to do so for peace and prosperity. The Philippines integrates the human rights agenda into its development initiatives for the purpose of protecting everyone, especially the most vulnerable â?? families, women and children, the poor, indigenous people, migrant workers, the elderly and persons with disabilities â?? from lawlessness, violence and anarchy. That is why we have a massive campaign to restore the rule of law by fighting corruption, crime and illegal drugs. We owe it to the 10 million Filipinos working overseas to keep their children and families safe. We owe it to all Filipino families and other States with nationals living in our country to keep the Philippines safe. The very principle of the responsibility to protect must encompass, first and foremost, the vast majority of peaceful, law-abiding people who need protection from those who are not. It is for their safety and sustenance that States exist, and for which Governments and leaders are responsible. President Duterte said the fewest words and made the fewest promises in the campaign. Why? Because he listened. He listened and he heard what none of the other candidates would listen to. The vast majority of the Filipino people felt vulnerable in their lives and livelihoods, and unsafe in the rising drug-driven criminality that threatened those least able to protect themselves. These people whom past Governments had least protected are the poor and ordinary folk. The Philippinesâ?? comprehensive campaign against illegal drugs is a necessary instrument to preserve and protect the human rights of all Filipinos. It is never an instrument to violate the human rights of any individual or group. It was noted by President Trump in this Hall that â??we do expect all nations to uphold the two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nationâ??. This is as true in bilateral relations between sovereign countries as when they combine multilaterally on a common decision or action. The Philippines is a sovereign country; indeed, it was the first subject nation to win its independence, however short-lived, thereby earning the honour of being the first republic in Asia. We expect our sovereignty to be respected and our democratically elected Governmentâ??s assessment of threats and how to go about addressing them to be accorded pre-eminence among nations. Is it too much to ask for the benefit of the doubt, at the very least? We prize sovereignty in all its aspects. We acknowledge the wisdom embodied in the words spoken by President Trump in this Hall: â??All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizensâ??. In keeping with that obligation, it is the Stateâ??s duty to protect human life, human dignity, and human rights from aggression by other States, terrorism from non-State actors and the destruction of societies and families from criminal networks trafficking in drugs, people and arms. As a responsible leader, the President of the Philippines launched a vigorous campaign against the illegal drug trade to save lives, preserve families, protect communities and stop the country from becoming a narco-State â?? an epidemic would spell the end of sovereignty in any meaningful sense. As of August 2017, the drug trade had penetrated at least 24,848 barangays, representing 59 per cent of the 42,036 smallest Government units spanning our archipelago â?? those directly in touch with our people. It is estimated that 4 to 7 million people have used or are becoming dependent on drugs. Where is sovereignty in a country where vast numbers are addicted to drugs and enslaved by their suppliers? To be sure, drug addiction calls for cure and not chastisement. When the President showed his fierce determination to end the drug menace, 1.3 million drug users turned themselves in. Their constitutional rights were fully respected, and those who wanted a cure or rehabilitation were offered such options. But the neglect of the drug problem by previous Governments has left the current one hard-pressed to rehabilitate them all. We are grateful that generous souls at home and abroad are building centres around the country, and we sincerely thank them. While drug addiction calls for rehabilitation, drug trafficking surely calls for stern measures, though always consistent with the rule of law. The President has and will always have zero tolerance for abusive  police officers, as time will show â?? I repeat, our President has zero tolerance for any type of abuse, be it drug abuse, abuse of human rights, abuse of our laws or abuse by State actors, including our policemen. But accusations before investigation do not constitute proof, nor are they fair. Abuses have occurred and mistakes have been made â?? tragic ones, for sure. While one abuse is one too many, still there are far fewer abuses than the imaginary numbers claimed by partisan accusers and publicity-seekers. The drug trade has even penetrated law enforcement and our courts, and yet the message we receive is that the best way to prevent abuse in the anti-drug campaign is to stop the campaign and live with drugs instead. But we cannot live with drugs, because drugs will not let us live. Headlines today depict human rights abuse, but what about the headlines from yesterday, or last week? Two-year-olds, 4-year-olds and 6-year- olds were raped; mothers sold their children to feed their drug addictions; and children shot their parents because they believed them to be the devil. The problem is that the West sometimes thinks that the kind of drugs that are present in its societies â?? heroin, cocaine and marijuana â?? are the same drugs that we are talking about. We are talking about methamphetamine hydrochloride, otherwise known as shabu, which both the United Nations and the World Health Organization have said is associated with violence and paranoia. With cocaine, heroin and marijuana, the drug war is among the suppliers, but with methamphetamines, the war is within the family and every family affected by these drugs is a victim. We can no more live with drugs than we can with terrorism which, as the United Nations admits â?? and as we have discovered â?? is funded by the drug trade. This has created the new phenomenon of criminal insurgency. In the century before last, a huge and well- populated Asian country was enslaved by a maritime Power that flooded it with drugs. We welcome this opportunity to address the international communityâ??s concerns and correct the perceptions gleaned from media reports that deny the real scale of the problem, as if denial were a solution. The problem is huge and we will not reduce it in our imagination because we dare not face it in reality. Appeasement emboldens evil. We counsel patience, but delay will make the problem bigger until it is beyond containment and control. Indeed, as we heard from President Trump in this Hall, â??When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strengthâ?? (ibid.). We will not slide down the slope of complacency in wilful ignorance of the threat posed to our country and our people by the drug trade. In the past four years, we have seen the rise of the Islamic State and how it has spread its nihilistic ideology beyond Iraq and Syria to become a serious threat to the whole world. We should have no illusions that the threat posed by the Islamic State will end with the collapse of its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq, and very soon in Syria. Rather, we should all be ready to confront a very potent threat that has spread to other parts of the world. In the Philippines, we have discovered the intimate and symbiotic relationship between terrorism, poverty and the illegal drug trade. Terrorists were somehow able to bring together an assortment of extremists, criminals, mercenaries and foreign fighters who attempted, but failed, to take over the great city of Marawi. That was part of their grand plan to establish in South-East Asia an extension or province of their shattered caliphate in the Middle East. The Armed Forces of the Philippines shall regain full control of Marawi from the Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Their protracted hold of their remaining several square metres of the city is largely a result of superior arms that were illegally obtained and the presence of civilian hostages, used by them as human shields. There is also the Governmentâ??s forbearance to unleash greater force in order to avoid collateral loss of life. The fight has been terrible, but the effort has been patient and careful to spare the innocent. There has been less talk and more listening to those with the most at stake in the struggle â?? the people of Marawi. The disturbance will soon be over and the rebuilding of Marawi will begin shortly. Terrorism is a global problem that no country can tackle alone, although here at the United Nations it has been noted with some admiration that Filipino families outside the conflict zone quickly absorbed most of the 200,000 displaced civilians. Our main disaster preparedness is Filipino compassion. The Filipino family system is strong, the bayanihan system is alive, and cooperation is a tradition of the Philippines. Help from fellow Filipinos is always at hand. While the main burden is borne by our Government and people and all the risks are taken by our soldiers, we are thankful for the assistance extended to us by the international community. From the bottom of my heart, I thank all who have helped, are continuing to help and have promised help. I thank those dear friends for helping when we needed it most. The Philippines welcomes the creation of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism to bring together, as a cohesive whole, the work of Member States and the United Nations on counter-terrorism. It will be a sharing of experience and sober reflection rather than of blind anxieties. That is where real results will be achieved. As a founding Member of the United Nations, the Philippines has been a strong advocate of the rule of law. We uphold the core of the United Nations mission to draw upon the strength and sovereign equality of its Members to achieve their common goals. Centuries ago, ambitions to take land resulted in long and terrible wars. The battle has shifted to the seas; hence the need to affirm our commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the international law governing the rights and responsibilities of States parties in their use of the worldâ??s oceans. The issues â?? including territorial claims, sovereignty rights, security, and the protection of marine life and resources, to name a few â?? are undoubtedly numerous, intertwined and complex. Dialogue, building trust and promoting cooperation are the way forward in addressing maritime disputes. This year, as Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines looks forward to successful negotiations on the long-overdue code of conduct in the West Philippine Sea/South China Sea. We fully thank our ASEAN neighbours, the individual ASEAN States and China for their utmost cooperation in that endeavour. Again, in this work, it is essential to have patience, to listen and to be willing to work with, rather than against, each other. We live in a global community, and we are citizens of the world. Today, our social contract is no longer confined to our nation State. In our region, we exert efforts to build bridges and not walls; to emphasize commonalities and not differences; to think less that we are Filipinos, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, Koreans or Chinese, and to think more of ourselves as Asian. Beyond being Asians, we are global citizens â?? the people of the United Nations. Human rights and the dignity of every person are the main pillars of the United Nations and of the Philippines, too. As a very spiritual people, we are united in believing that man and woman were created in Godâ??s image. There can be no compromise of human rights for those who break the law, nor for those who are their victims. We also believe in accountability, especially in the practical conviction that as we sow, so shall we reap. We should never tolerate human rights abuses, but neither should we tolerate misinformation or fake news on or the politicization of human rights, as those undermine our collective efforts as the United Nations to uphold the universality of human rights and dignity of human life. But why debate security versus human rights? Security and human rights are not incompatible. Indeed, the former is our duty to the latter. Without security, the most basic human rights to life and safety are constantly under attack from terrorism, criminality, drug trafficking and human trafficking. Much has been said about ASEAN, which is identified with words such as cooperation, consultation and consensus. Critics have remarked on the slowness of ASEANâ??s way of proceeding. Yet, as slow as ASEANâ??s progress has been, it has been solid, substantive and irreversible, precisely because of the patience with which it is made. It is thereby proving to be a consensus- based organization that is working, and working well. Five decades ago, South-East Asia was marred by conflicts, and all previous attempts at South-East Asian regionalism proved extremely difficult, if not impossible for some. Our different cultures, differing ideologies and different political systems only reinforced that pessimistic outlook. Fifty years later, the ASEAN miracle prevails with greater political and economic prospects that have gripped global interest. ASEAN has overcome the divisions, fears and hostilities of the past. We have used regional cooperation to promote growth, development, integration and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Today, the Philippines patiently builds stronger relationships with the international community through ASEAN and the United Nations. We remain a friend to all and an enemy to none. We are here to bridge and build a more peaceful, secure and stable world. There is no development without peace and no peace without development. That is what the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides for. It serves as the template of the Philippines development plan, called AmBisyon Natin 2040, or Our Ambition 2040. While the Philippines has experienced unprecedented economic growth, we are adopting measures to make growth more inclusive through massive poverty-alleviation programmes that are creating more jobs, driving innovation and making quality education universally available â?? relevant education that imparts training and skill-building to make people resilient in changing markets, building greater trust in Government and hopes for raising tens of millions of Filipinos from poverty. There is a link between increasing poverty, corruption and a deteriorating environment. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte seeks to reverse that linkage by addressing the adverse effects of climate change â?? to which the Philippines is most vulnerable â?? through disaster-risk reduction and the strict implementation of laws protecting the environment. He is equally decisive on abuses that damage our environment. To honour the immense sacrifices of our 10 million Filipinos abroad, and all other migrant workers of the world who make huge sacrifices so that their families may have a better life, we press on with our advocacy for a global compact on migration. As we seek to improve conditions for foreign nationals living and working in the Philippines, we advocate the fundamental concept of loving our neighbour as we love ourselves. We call on the United Nations to elevate migration on its agenda. If we listen to each other, we will hear the same thing. We have no need for nuclear weapons. Again, we have no need for nuclear weapons. There is absolutely no benefit to another Cold War or to an arms race. We want nuclear weapons to be a thing of the past, and we do not want an arms race in any part of the world. On 7 July, the Philippines joined 121 other Member States in securing our world from weapons of mass destruction by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Three days ago, I had the privilege of signing the Treaty on behalf of the Philippines. The Philippines calls on Member States with nuclear weapons to likewise sign on in order to find a way to provide the world with security without the threat of mass destruction. We can have a safe world only if we get rid of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. By doing so, we shall save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind. The Philippines, on its own and as this yearâ??s Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has expressed its grave concern over the growing tensions on the Korean peninsula because of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s missile test launches and detonations. The Philippines joins the call on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to put a stop to its provocations, which bring us closer to an unimaginable scenario â?? a war to end all wars because no one will be left to fight new ones. Let me end where I began, and call again for patience, listening and cooperation, focused always on the well-being of, as stated in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, â??We, the peoples of the United Nationsâ??. Let us listen to each other as we all are the people of the United Nations. Our faith and destiny as human beings on this planet are intertwined. In a situation like the present, where every finger in and around the Korean peninsula is on a trigger and every eye is on the lookout for a wrong move, the likelihood of a surprise attack is virtually zero. In that context, no one can be caught by surprise and unprepared to strike back. So what is there to lose by going on talking and listening until the very last moment, in the hope that a resolution will be found? Patience, listening as much as talking, and cooperation among friends and even enemies are the signposts on the path of peace. Peace is about people. No people and no country can have a national identity if there are no others that can tell the difference. Without people â?? each one different, yet all the same in their being and in the good they seek â?? it is impossible to imagine the world. To utter the phrase â??the worldâ?? means a planet with many peoples sharing it. All of us are pieces of a giant puzzle. We seek to be completed by being pieced together, thereby creating a whole, beautiful picture. In a war of all against all, of every one against the other, the last man standing is not at peace; rather, he is simply a single piece. He is not the victor; he is simply alone. I congratulate the President on his election, and he can count on the support of the Philippines.",1,196
7840,Session 72 - 2017,PLW_72_2017.txt,PLW_72_2017,72,2017,PLW,"I would like first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to lead our work in the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to thank his Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his exceptional service during his recently completed term as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. At the outset, the people of Palau extend our deepest condolences to those who have had their lives devastated by the recent spate of hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters across Asia and the Americas. We must not forget that many do not have the resources necessary to rebuild. The international community must work harder to ensure that they are not abandoned. Such record-breaking storms are a harbinger of worse to come on a hotter planet. Palau, in the Pacific, has experienced at first hand the impact of climate extremes. For us, those super- storms are akin to ticking time bombs: no one knows when or where the next one will detonate, but we are keenly aware that they can wipe out years of progress in the span of hours. The Presidentâ??s clear determination to focus future efforts on conflict prevention, peace, migration and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet is certainly timely and well attuned to the realities of our generation. In fact, his attention to those very different yet related issues demonstrates a clear understanding of the complex times in which we live and the need to connect the dots between the causes and the effects of the interrelated challenges that we face. In this modern world, we must continue to expand our cooperation at every level â?? private, public, not- for-profit and political â?? within the context of a global network that establishes fair and transparent guidelines that prescribe how to act and react to those dynamic topics. The only body that can fill that essential void is the United Nations. With respect to sustainable development, we recognized, in 2015, through the adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, that a global rights- based regime was necessary in the context of a global partnership, if we are to successfully eradicate poverty, address universal inequalities and provide economic and social opportunities to all for the peoples of the world. Through the creation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, we finally recognized that the oceans are a resource that belong to and serve all the peoples of the world and must be protected as such. By coming together and finally agreeing on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we established a global commitment to begin the process of reducing greenhouse gases to acceptable levels. Yet even as we worked hard to respond to that global environmental crisis through joint actions, we have found other issues of security and peace taking the forefront in our international conversation. As the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) is pushed back from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea has been firing missiles and detonating atomic and possibly hydrogen bombs, thereby threatening worldwide peace and harmony. At the same time, migrants throughout the world are forced to flee their countries to escape the ever-increasing levels of violence. Those are issues that must be dealt with globally through strong multinational institutions and partnerships. If those efforts are to be successful within the framework of the United Nations, the United Nations must be strengthened so that all of its members can believe in the fairness and effectiveness of the overall international negotiation and dispute-resolution process. These are the issues that our global focus is centred upon: a decent life for all and a sustainable planet. I believe that we can all agree that, in terms of peace and security, inclusive sustainable development frequently prevents conflicts and sustains peace. However, peace is not always achievable, and when that is the case, the United Nations must facilitate efforts to respond to aggression and violence. Palau therefore supports all efforts and United Nations resolutions aimed at bringing North Korea to the negotiating table. The threat posed to the innocent people of Guam is a threat to us in Palau and the entire region. Palau also reaffirms its support for international efforts to eradicate terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and Al-Qaida. We must also support the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts to revamp the United Nations architectures and procedures for peace and security development and management as a significant component of the overall reform of the Organization. The Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) face a unique set of security and development challenges. However, the United Nations presence in the region is quite limited. In shepherding that process, I urge the Secretary-General to recall the guiding principle that was so successful in delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: leave no country behind. Taking into account the recent actions by North Korea, we must take seriously the long-term need to ban nuclear weapons. A good place to start would be by acceding to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I must give credit to the leaders of my country, who, more than 30 years ago, recognized the threat of nuclear weapons and banned the use, testing and storage of nuclear weapons in Palauâ??s Constitution. In their honour, I signed that Treaty yesterday. If we are to find success in achieving our 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda, we are going to have to face the hard reality that the costs are very significant. Success will require all available partnerships and the development of the necessary means of implementation in line with the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the Samoa Pathway. In the area of climate change, we must continue to work to achieve the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I would like to congratulate my colleague from the Pacific His Excellency Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji on his imminent ascension to the presidency of the upcoming twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In order to strengthen his efforts, Palau is seeking the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for climate and security. The appointment of a Special Representative would significantly aid us in our preparations to confront that multifaceted challenge and would enhance United Nations reform proposals. My country, although small, is very proud of its commitment to achieving our Global 2030 Agenda. To help protect our oceans, we have established one of the largest protected areas in the world. Within that context, we emphasize our support for a new implementing agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. We have also supported resolution WCC-2016-Res-050, entitled â??Increasing marine protected area coverage for effective marine biodiversity conservationâ??, adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 2016, which promises to work towards designating and effectively setting aside at least 30 per cent of coastal Statesâ?? national waters as marine protected areas by 2030. In addition, we have committed to addressing and taking action with regard to marine pollution in all its forms. At the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, Palau also called on other countries to join it in becoming parties to the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, an international treaty that will help stop the transfer of illegally caught fish and marine life through our ports. I would like to make the same appeal here today. In our work to save our oceans, we welcome the appointment of His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji as the first Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Oceans, which promises to bring greater attention to one of our most urgent priorities. Palau extends its congratulations to its close friend from Fiji. Those types of commitment require the strong support of a broad alliance of partners. Fortunately, my country has a long history of strong partnerships. The United States continues to support Palau in its development and movement towards economic independence. We have a shared history and over the decades have become close friends. We recognize the unique relationship that we share. In these difficult times, we support and participate in the efforts of the United States, on behalf of the world community, to combat terrorism, bring closure to the hostilities in Syria and reduce the nuclear threat emanating from North Korea. We also thank the United States for its ongoing support for our efforts to establish our national marine sanctuary. We look forward this year to completing our compact of free association agreement with the United States, which will reflect that close and special relationship. Palau also would like to acknowledge the great friendship that it has with Japan and the very significant economic support that we have received from that country over the years. We continue to express our support for the expansion and reform of the Security Council and Japanâ??s permanent membership on the Security Council. We wish to express our sincere thanks for the Nippon Foundationâ??s generous support to enhance partnership and collaboration in our marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. We would also like to recognize the very broad list of partners across the world who make our efforts to achieve a sustainable future possible, including the Republic of China on Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Monaco, Italy, the Netherlands, the European Union, private organizations, non-governmental organizations and civil society, among many others. At the end of the day, our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of genuine and durable partnerships at every level of society. The issues that we face are becoming increasingly severe, dangerous and global in scope. They cannot be dealt with at the national or regional level alone. At no time in the history of my country or, indeed, the history of the world has the need for a strong global partnership of countries, organizations and people, through a single binding assembly of nations been more important. The United Nations has the potential to reconcile our global issues if â?? and only if â?? its Members are willing to recognize those issues and take the necessary action to develop and implement appropriate solutions. My small country â?? despite its size â?? is willing to act in concert with the other nations of this great Organization to achieve a better life for our children, grandchildren and all future generations.",1,196
7841,Session 72 - 2017,PNG_72_2017.txt,PNG_72_2017,72,2017,PNG,"On behalf of my Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, I am honoured to address the General Assembly. I am pleased to convey my countryâ??s appreciation to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his outstanding presidency this past year. As he takes up his mandate, Papua New Guinea welcomes and congratulates Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, and the Republic of Slovakia, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I pledge Papua New Guineaâ??s support for his presidency and the priority areas he has chosen. I would also like to welcome and extend our best wishes for every success to His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his new, vital and very demanding role. It is heartening to note his passion and drive to transform the United Nations. The Organization can better serve the international community if it becomes more accountable, transparent, inclusive and fair, and to that end Mr. Guterres has Papua New Guineaâ??s strongest support. Let me also pay tribute to the former Secretary- General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his outstanding work during his tenure. Our world continues to be confronted by multiple unprecedented challenges that are increasingly complex in nature. We are facing such serious adverse impacts as an uncertain global economy, climate change, the declining health of our marine habitats and heightened security fears. The challenges that we face are unlikely to be overcome, or major goals achieved, by individual countries acting on their own, which I am sure is a view shared by many. We must work together to build a better, more stable and equitable world for all our citizens. We all have to do more, and we must renew our faith in the promise of the Charter of the United Nations, which remains a beacon of hope for humankind. Papua New Guinea recently held its tenth national elections. Our Government would like to put on record our profound appreciation to all of our development partners, including the United Nations, for the valued support provided to us as the elections were conducted. Since being returned to office, our Government has pledged to further increase our focus on the core policies we have striven to implement during the past five years. Those policies are changing the lives of our 8 million men, women and children for the better. We have introduced free education across our entire country and doubled the number of children in school, most of whom are girls. We are extending universal health care to our people, which is helping them to live longer and is keeping families together. We have commenced the largest infrastructure programme in our nationâ??s history, building more roads, ports and public buildings, including hospitals. Our particular focus on infrastructure is promoting economic development and greater opportunity, especially for our rural majority. Those policies underpin our commitment to sustainable economic growth and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A nation such as Papua New Guinea can have all the best intentions and plans to continue to move our country forward, but we live in a rapidly globalizing world where events and influences transcend national borders. Many of the challenges that confront us today are not of our making; rather, we have to bear the consequences of actions taken by others and must take up the task of addressing them. Global economic uncertainty, depressed commodity prices and political instability all continue to undermine growth in many developing countries. Papua New Guinea remains concerned at the continuing threats of violence in the world today, be they by terrorist groups or the actions of rogue States. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the recent nuclear missile tests by North Korea. They are direct threats to the lives of millions of innocent people in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and more particularly in our Pacific region. We are concerned that these activities are taking place in our backyard. They are in direct breach of the will of the international community as expressed through the numerous relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Rather than inflamed rhetoric that could have drastic consequences, we call for a peaceful resolution through political dialogue. One of the greatest threats to humankind comes from within our global community of nations. Climate change is real, and it is claiming lives and destroying communities. It is putting the future of nations at real risk. The recent barrage of hurricanes that hit the Caribbean and the United States is just another example of some of the extreme weather events that we are all confronting. Papua New Guinea offers its condolences to the countries affected and urges that the loss of life serve as another wake-up call for us all. Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations remain highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, including extreme tropical storms, severe droughts and seawater flooding many coastal communities. The seeds of climate change that we see today were laid by developed countries over past decades and centuries. Although their own development was enhanced, developing countries today continue to suffer because of their actions. The chances for development in smaller countries have been harmed by the mess created by now-powerful nations. In Papua New Guinea and around the world, our peoples are dying as a consequence, living standards are being eroded, and opportunities are disappearing. The world needs to step up its action and respond effectively to climate-change challenges by making further commitments to reduce emissions and help affected communities. We are committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and to implementing domestic policies to reduce our own emissions. We welcome and support Fijiâ??s presidency of the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and will work together for a successful meeting in Bonn. Papua New Guinea is an island nation. The very well-being and economic development of our people is tied to the resources coming from our oceans and seas. We share growing concern about the declining health of the oceans and seas that sustain many nations. Uncontrolled and poorly regulated human activities, including illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, pollutants, plastics and marine debris, are killing our waterways. Global fish stocks are being decimated, ecosystems are being destroyed, and our people are being forced to abandon their traditional homes because they no longer have jobs or food. This is not a local problem; it is global in its scope and therefore needs greater global action. We do what we can at the local level. We in Papua New Guinea have established an integrated national oceans policy and a supporting office to ensure a more coherent national approach to oceans governance. Our commitment to SDG 14 is undiminished, as was demonstrated by our support for the call-for-action outcome document and the voluntary commitments that we have all pledged. We are pleased with the historic outcome of the first- ever United Nations Ocean Conference held four months ago in the General Assembly to support the implementation of SDG 14. We welcome and support the offer from Kenya and Portugal to be the next hosts of the United Nations Ocean Conference. Another major problem and challenge that we face in the world today is the dislocation of people from their homes and communities. Indeed, we are facing a refugee crisis in the world today. People are being pushed out of their homes as a result of war, natural disasters and the loss of livelihood. This is the plight of millions of people in developing countries who face dismal futures if in fact they succeed in surviving at all. The responsibility for accommodating these refugees â?? people who through no fault of their own are forced to flee â?? lies with the countries whose actions that led to their displacement. Today, we live in a globalizing world, but the privilege to travel freely is held by only a lucky few who have been born principally in developed and industrialized countries. We need a more sensible and humane approach to achieving mobility for all our people. We have only one planet, we all share that planet, and the people of that planet should be free to travel and settle when their home has been taken away from them. We talk about greater freedoms for our people. We talk about freedom of speech, democracy, transparency, good governance and human rights, but talk is cheap. All too often, the concept of human rights is a mere theme of convenience. We need to make the migration process less complicated and more humane. Papua New Guinea fully supports reform at the United Nations. The United Nations must be fit for purpose. It must keep pace with the environment in a rapidly changing world. There is broad agreement on the importance of United Nations reform, but the main challenge before us is how we are going to go about delivering it. We are heartened by the Secretary- Generalâ??s passion and call for decisive and swift action on his reform agenda, including in terms of ensuring gender parity at the top levels of the Secretariat. He has our undivided support. With respect to the Security Council reform process, it must advance the core interests of the vast majority of the States Members of the United Nations so as to make the Council more broadly representative, transparent, accountable, effective and efficient. Given its critical mandate, the Security Council needs to be more efficient in its response to contemporary global challenges and circumstances. In conclusion, the opportunities that lie before the global community are great, but they are also extremely challenging, particularly for countries with developing economies, such as Papua New Guinea. Regardless of where we come from, however, we must do more. All nations â?? large or small, rich or poor, weak or strong â?? must strengthen their resolve and work together. I thank all Member States for the achievements that we continue to make through the United Nations, and I pledge that Papua New Guinea will continue to work with them to achieve much more.",1,196
7842,Session 72 - 2017,POL_72_2017.txt,POL_72_2017,72,2017,POL,"I would first like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, on his election to this honourable post. I would also like to assure him of Polandâ??s full support for the tasks ahead of him and to say how pleased we are at his election, since he represents a country that is a friend and neighbour to my own. Once again, I offer him my warmest congratulations. I would also like to express my thanks to Mr. Peter Thomson for his active presidency during the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. Like the pillars of the United Nations system, the international communityâ??s basic goals are the promotion of sustainable development, the maintenance of peace and security and the protection of human rights. I was therefore very pleased to learn that the theme of this yearâ??s session is focusing on peopleâ??s needs. Too often in global politics we devote too much time and attention to broad economic models and social systems, forgetting that politics and economics are in fact human issues. When we lose our focus on those issues, we inevitably lose sight of the goal that underpins our shared efforts, which should be that of ensuring peace and well-being for every individual and family in every State through a policy whose goal is to serve the people and meet their needs, and that is based on the notion of the dignity that is inherent in human life. As we address a people-centred policy that is focused on the human need to live in peace and in decent conditions, we should first and foremost consider the importance of defending and protecting human life. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we all adopted, defines a global model for sustainable development. In line with its recommendations, we should concentrate our efforts on the elimination of poverty in all its manifestations through the implementation of a series of economic, social and environmental goals. At the same time, we must bear in mind that this process should be accompanied by respect for all our interconnected rights, including economic, social, political, civil and cultural rights and the right to development. While in adopting the 2030 Agenda we demonstrated our ability to take action as a community, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals remains a formidable challenge that will require close cooperation at the international level. As a reliable and responsible partner, Poland is committed to the full implementation of the Goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We believe that only through their effective implementation will we be able to ensure the achievement of the desired socioeconomic conditions for all. That involves coordination and comprehensive action across many sectors and at all levels of Government, from local to national to regional to international. Domestically, Poland is taking concrete steps to implement its vision for development in the spirit of the 2030 Agenda to ensure that none of its citizens is left behind. The strategy for responsible development that the Polish Government adopted in February is designed to ensure that Poland and its people can maintain a level of development that is sustainable, stable and, most important, responsible, and that will embrace both current and, especially, future generations. In the international arena, Poland supports countries that, among other things, are seeking to develop economically through development cooperation. We want to ensure that our actions are as effective as possible, and therefore, using the experience of the Polish authorities and non-governmental organizations, we are working with States that we can support most effectively. We are deeply concerned about the growing number of people who are suffering as a result of protracted conflicts, particularly in Syria and Ukraine. Guided by the principle of solidarity, we have also been consistently increasing our humanitarian aid. In our view, it is also very important to ensure cohesion and complementarity between humanitarian aid and development aid and to work to eliminate the underlying causes of humanitarian crises. That is our shared duty, and the future of the world order and the international community depends upon how we deliver on it. In addition, we should not fail to continue to respect and strengthen international humanitarian law. One of the Goals of the 2030 Agenda is halting the changes occurring in our natural environment, which can be seen in every country and on every continent, and which have are having negative effects on national economies and the living standards of entire communities. For a number of years, Poland has been part of global efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change. We have fulfilled our obligations in that regard, surpassing our reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. We have worked in concert with the European Union to make an exceedingly ambitious global contribution to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and will continue our low- carbon development efforts with the aim of protecting our climate. Next year, for the third time, Poland will have the honour of hosting the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 24). COP 24, to be held in the city of Katowice, will be of key importance, owing to the Conferenceâ??s expected adoption of the implementation package for the Paris Agreement. As President of the COP, Poland will do its best to ensure that the summitâ??s outcome is an ambitious one. We will continue to demonstrate leadership in climate negotiations, in the spirit of the Paris Agreement, while ensuring that all States can participate and that the discussions are transparent, while respecting countriesâ?? varying domestic conditions and their choices along the path to reducing emissions. Polandâ??s election to the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the period 2018-2019 reflects my countryâ??s growing potential and its involvement in efforts to ensure international peace and security. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the 190 votes cast for Poland, one of the best results in the history of elections to the Council. For us, the election and its result are both a huge honour and a major obligation. I would like to thank the United Nations community for placing their confidence in us. We view our membership in the Security Council as a commitment to representing all States Members of the United Nations, regardless of their affiliations with regional groups. We see the Security Council as representing values that are particularly important to my nation. First and foremost, they include our firm attachment to the inalienable right of every nation to sovereignty and freedom. We are joining the Security Council in the conviction that international law is the only effective mechanism for preserving peaceful relations among nations. Freedom is synonymous with peace, while enslavement is a source of war. Principles such as the freedom of speech and sovereign nation Statesâ?? right to self-determination are of particular importance to security. I bring this subject up because last year in particular saw an increase in instances in many States where political processes were manipulated through the imposition of hybrid measures, either by means of propaganda or direct interference in the democratic process. Such attempts by third countries to influence the democratic policies pursued by free nations should also be of concern to the international community. Such issues, as well as analysis of current international relations, serve to emphasize that security in the modern world should be viewed from many platforms. It is not just a Stateâ??s military strength that determines its citizensâ?? sense of security, but also areas that often transcend the regular purview of the Security Councilâ??s work. Changes in the natural environment, economic disparities, conflicts fuelled by competition over natural resources, and inadequate health care can also undermine that sense of security, and I believe those issues should feature permanently on the Councilâ??s agenda. Respect for, and the absolute primacy of, international law in relations among States safeguard our effectiveness in ensuring international peace and security. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Poland will strive to ensure that all disputes and conflicts are resolved in line with the fundamental principle of peaceful settlement. In that context, we fully agree with the high priority that should be given to mediation and conflict prevention, as advocated by the Secretary-General, and which accords with our belief that preventive measures that target the underlying sources of problems on the ground produce the best, quickest and most tangible results. When I visited the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa earlier this year, I discussed the importance of the international communityâ??s ability to prevent conflicts. Conflicts do not exist without root causes and, by the same token, there are no conflicts that cannot be brought to an end. We should apply that approach first and foremost, though not exclusively, to issues related to mass migration and refugees, which represent problems that many regions and continents share. The continuing internal clashes and risks of terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as all the challenges that they entail, call for a common response on the part of the whole international community. That is why it is our duty to eliminate the root causes of the refugee problem and restore the right of all people to live in their home countries. Humanitarian operations and development aid must be aimed at achieving the fundamental goal of helping refugees in order ultimately to help them return to their homes. Operations that help to build the resilience of States and societies are particularly important to efforts to deal with issues such as structural poverty, unemployment and lack of access to education. Poland has always considered ensuring the effectiveness of international law to be of prime importance. Its regulations are founded on the principles of cooperation and meeting international obligations in good faith, thereby ensuring that international disputes can be resolved through dialogue rather than aggression and armed violence. In dealing with situations in which States use aggression as an instrument of foreign policy, Poland urges the international community to refrain from recognizing the faits accomplis that can result from such policies. We in Poland want to help to build an international order founded on the principles of State sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt to violate those principles, successful or not, weakens mutual trust. For almost 10 years in Georgia, and almost three in Ukraine, we have witnessed clear violations of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the inviolability of borders, respect for sovereignty and rejection of the use of military force in the settlement of disputes. In our view, absolute respect for international law creates a foundation for the stable, predictable and peaceful settlement of differences among States, and through that the assurance of truly sustainable growth. The situation in the Korean peninsula has been marked by flagrant attempts to disrupt the prevailing world order that have contributed to the growing risk of escalation of the situation in the region. The Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s development of a nuclear and missile programme, as well as its most recent tests of nuclear weapons, constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We hope that the international community will continue its intensified efforts in that regard, including the Councilâ??s recent adoption of new resolutions, and enable us to halt the spiral of tension and stabilize the situation in the region. Poland sets great store by the goals of disarmament and the idea of a world free of nuclear weapons. The only instrument at hand that can genuinely bring us closer to achieving that vision is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The Treaty is subject to review every five years in order to take stock of progress towards its realization and reinforce its commitments. Poland has now taken the lead in the preparation process for the upcoming NPT Review Conference in 2020, a testament to our longstanding commitment to non-proliferation, a ban on nuclear tests and the peaceful use of atomic energy. The third pillar of the United Nations system is the protection of human rights, whose foundation is the fundamental right to life. Regrettably, there are too many places in the world that have been stripped of that right, as well as the right to human dignity, personal freedom and freedom of conscience and religion. One particularly visible problem in that regard is the persecution of religious minorities, including Christians. Poland condemns in the strongest terms every instance of persecution and discrimination based on religion and insists on the importance of Statesâ?? commitments to ensuring protection to all members of religious minorities, in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The right to live in dignity should also include the right to uphold oneâ??s native traditions and traditional family model, as long as they are compatible with the fundamental rights of individuals. In its campaign for membership of the Security Council, Poland chose the motto â??Solidarity, responsibility, engagementâ??. Those are the values that we are constantly seeking to promote in the international arena. Only through a sense of shared responsibility, coupled with harmonious engagement and cooperation among all States, will we be able to achieve sustainable development, security and peace, and not only today, but for generations to come.",1,196
7843,Session 72 - 2017,PRK_72_2017.txt,PRK_72_2017,72,2017,PRK,"First of all, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I look forward to the successful outcome of this session, which will unfold under his able guidance. Before going into the main points in my remarks, I feel obligated to make comments on the speech made some four days ago by someone called the United States President, which tainted this sacred United Nations forum. Since Trump uttered such reckless and violent words from this very rostrum, attacking the supreme dignity of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, I think it is fair for me to respond in a corresponding tone. During his eight months in power, he has turned the White House into a noisy marketplace filled with the crackling sounds of abacus beads. Now he has tried to turn the United Nations forum into a gangsterâ??s nest where only money is respected and bloodshed is the order of the day. The absurd reality of a person like Trump â?? a mentally deranged and complacent megalomaniac, a person who is even chastised by some Americans as â??Commander-in-Griefâ??, â??Lyinâ?? Kingâ?? and â??President Evilâ?? â?? holding the office of President of the United States, and, indeed, the dangerous reality of an aging gambler using threats, fraud and every other type of schemes to acquire a patch of land having his finger on the nuclear button, are what constitute the gravest threat to international peace and security today. Due to his lack of basic common knowledge and appropriate feelings, he has tried to insult the supreme dignity of my country by referring to its leader as â??rocket manâ??. By doing so, however, he has committed the irreversible error of making our rockets rain down on the entire United States mainland all the more inevitable. No one other than Trump himself is on a suicide mission. Should innocent lives in the United States be harmed by his suicidal inclinations, Trump will be held totally responsible. Our respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong Un responded to Trumpâ??s statement: â??As a man who represents the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea and on behalf of the dignity and honour of my State and my people, and on my own behalf, I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the United States pay dearly for his speech calling for the total destruction of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea.â?? Trump may not have been aware of what he uttered, but we will make sure that he bears consequences far beyond his words and far beyond the scope of what he can handle â?? even if he claims to be able to handle anything. The theme of the seventy-second session is â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. For all countries and peoples to enjoy peace and a decent life, it is imperative that genuine international justice be realized before anything else. Realizing international justice is one of the principal missions of the United Nations. As Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations stipulates, one of the purposes of the United Nations is â??to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peaceâ??. However, due to the high-handedness and arbitrariness of one particular large Power, the purposes and principles of the Charter and other established basic principles of international relations are at present being wantonly ignored in the United Nations arena. Conspiracies to commit abnormal acts that justify or legitimize high-handedness and arbitrariness or acts that violate truth and justice are tolerated or supported. The most flagrant violation of international justice can be seen in the handling of the situation on the Korean peninsula. Unprecedented acts of injustice, including harsh sanctions imposed on a victim that has chosen to stand up to an offender, are openly committed in the name of the United Nations. The essence of the situation on the Korean peninsula is a confrontation between the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea and the United States, where the former is trying to defend its national dignity and sovereignty against the latterâ??s hostile policies and nuclear threats. The United States is the country that first produced nuclear weapons and the only country to have actually used them, massacring hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. The United States threatened to use nuclear weapons against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s and first introduced nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula after that war. The United States started large-scale joint military exercises against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea during the Cold War period and further intensified their scope and aggressive nature after the Cold War by staging them more frequently â?? several times a year â?? and by mobilizing more strategic nuclear assets. What could be a bigger threat than the use of the words â??fire and furyâ?? and â??total destructionâ??, in the statement made by the President of the worldâ??s biggest nuclear Power? The United States is the very reason that the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea has to possess nuclear weapons. We have had to develop and strengthen our nuclear arsenal to current levels so that we could cope with the threats of that country. The hostile policies and nuclear threats of the United States have continued for over 70 years, which has led to a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula. Further, due to the high-handedness of the United States, the United Nations has adopted unjustifiable resolutions that are the embodiment of injustice. Our respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman of the Workersâ?? Party of Korea, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, Supreme Commander of the Korean Peopleâ??s Army, has said that international justice is never achieved in a vacuum. Rather, it can be achieved only when independent, anti-imperialist countries are strong enough to demand it. Absent true international justice, the only philosophical principle that remains valid is that force must be addressed with force. Nuclear weapons of tyranny must therefore be met with the nuclear hammer of justice. Pursuant to this principle, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s use of nuclear deterrence is a righteous act of self-defence, and a last resort. As part of its efforts to achieve the goal of becoming a nuclear-weapon State, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea recently conducted the successful test of a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). With this step, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is in the process of consolidating its status as a nuclear Power, consistent with its double aim of developing its economy and its nuclear arsenal. For all intents and purposes, our nuclear weapons are a deterrent designed to put an end to the nuclear threat of the United States and to prevent a military invasion by that country. Our ultimate goal is to establish a balance of power with the United States. Everyone present in this Hall today is aware that, at every stage in the development and growth of its nuclear arsenal, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, unlike other nuclear-weapon States, has never failed to disclose its testing or the results of its testing. Since we have sufficiently strengthened our deterrent with a view to safeguarding the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region, the United States and its followers must now think twice before launching a military provocation against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. Although the United States speaks of fire and fury and total destruction, inter alia, every time it makes such provocations it is compelled to use qualifiers such as â??hopefully that will not be necessaryâ?? or â??that is not our first optionâ?? and so on. Accordingly, we are convinced that our actions have helped to consolidate the peace and security of North-East Asia and the region as a whole as much as possible. We do not need anyone else to recognize our status as a nuclear-weapon State or our nuclear-strike capability. As it flew through the endless blue sky in the recent ballistic test, our ICBM etched the sacred name of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea across the universe. The rocketâ??s warhead left its trace on the blue waves of the Pacific Ocean, and the tremendous explosion and vibrations caused by the hydrogen bomb were recorded all over the planet. Although our decision to opt for possession of nuclear weapons was forced upon us by the United States, it has resulted in our country achieving the status of a nuclear-weapon State and a rocket-possessing Power. The attendant prestige has become a part of the immortal destiny of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. The failure of the United Nations to fulfil its role of realizing genuine international justice is a primary result of the undemocratic and antiquated practices of the Security Council. For it is none other than the Security Council that disregards the Charter of the United Nations and acts only to satisfy the will and interests of its permanent members. It is not a trivial detail that the issue of Security Council reform was raised as early as 1992, at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, in resolution 47/62. Since then, the issue of Security Council reform has been discussed at the General Assembly every year for the past 25 years, without any progress whatsoever. It is therefore clear how deeply the current permanent members are fixated on their anachronistic vested interests. One permanent member alone can veto the general will of over 190 States Members of the United Nations, which is a testament to how undemocratic the Security Council is. In this Hall today, I would like once again to reiterate the unjust and unfair nature of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. First of all, relying on a double standard, the Security Council has adopted illegal resolutions that prohibit the launch of satellites by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. Such prohibition violates international law, which provides for the peaceful use of outer space as a sovereign right of every State. The Security Council takes no issue with any other satellite-launching countries. Secondly, also in reliance on a double standard, the Security Council has adopted illegal resolutions that arbitrarily prohibit nuclear tests by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, despite the fact that nuclear testing is the strict sovereign right of every State, since the international law on the prohibition of nuclear testing has not yet entered into force. In addition, other countries have conducted far more nuclear tests than we have. Thirdly, the Security Council has condemned the development of nuclear weapons by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea as a threat to international peace and security and, on that basis, once again relying on a double standard, has fabricated illegal resolutions that contravene Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which recognizes every Stateâ??s right to self- defence. The Security Council has taken such action without calling into question other countries that continue to develop nuclear weapons of various kinds. The reason that those unjust and unfair resolutions continue to be adopted is that the permanent members of the Security Council â?? all nuclear Powers â?? have a shared interest in maintaining their monopoly on nuclear status. The permanent members of the Security Council often talk of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, in the context of nuclear non-proliferation, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s possession of nuclear weapons is a justified measure of self-defence. Indeed, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was made possible because nuclear-weapon States had promised not to threaten non-nuclear-weapon States with their nuclear arsenals. Article X of the NPT stipulates that each party shall have the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that its supreme interests have been jeopardized. This Article recognizes that the supreme interests of States supersede nuclear non-proliferation. In the end, the United States has itself impeded international efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation by refusing to give up making nuclear threats against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. Rather, its behaviour has compelled the latter to strive to possess nuclear weapons. The foregoing eloquently demonstrates that the resolutions adopted to constrain the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea are not based on any established principle, but are simply the product of the undemocratic and antiquated practices of the Security Council and the conspiracy and collusion of forces that are obsessed with their own interests alone. The United States makes the claim, even here at the United Nations, that the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s possession of hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles constitutes a global threat. However, such a claim is a big lie tantamount to the notorious big lie conjured up by the United States in 2003 about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in order to justify invading that country. The Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is a responsible nuclear-weapon State. We will take preventive measures in the form of merciless pre-emptive action in the event that the United States or its vassal forces show any sign of undertaking any sort of decapitating operation on our headquarters or other military attack against our country. However, we have no intention whatsoever to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the countries that do not join in a United States military action against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. The United States is resorting to intrigue when it condemns the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s possession of nuclear weapons as a global threat. It is simply using that fact as a pretext for coercing other States Members of the United Nations into implementing the sanctions resolutions against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. It is a sneaky and selfish attempt by the United States to shirk its responsibility on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and pursue its own interests by using and sacrificing other countries that have nothing to do with the issue. The Government of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea requested the United Nations Secretariat to organize a forum of international law experts to assess the legal grounds and lawfulness of the Security Council resolutions, but we have had no response for nine months. Previously, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea had made repeated requests to the Security Council to discuss the serious threat to international peace and security posed by the large-scale, aggressive and provocative joint military exercises undertaken by the United States and South Korea, but each of these requests was turned down and the issue has never been put on the Security Councilâ??s agenda. The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that Members of the United Nations accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. If the resolutions on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea adopted at the Security Council were truly lawful and fair, there would be no need at all for United States ambassadors abroad, and even the United States President and the Secretary of State, to coerce other countries into implementing the resolutions. Furthermore, the United States would not have to bring its stooges, for example, South Korea and Japan, into the matter. The States Members of the United Nations should not give in to pressure exerted by an individual major Power on implementing Security Council resolutions. Rather, they should make an independent judgment on the legality, impartiality and morality of such resolutions and contribute to promoting Security Council reform by further raising their voices against high-handedness and arbitrariness. The United States imposed sanctions on our country from the very first day that it was founded, and the history of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea, which spans more that 70 years, is in a sense a history of struggle where its people have had to persevere on the road of self-development despite being under the worldâ??s harshest sanctions. Through such a prolonged arduous struggle, we are at last only a few steps away from the final stage of completing the Stateâ??s nuclear force. The possibility that the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea might be shaken an inch or change its stance as a result of harsher sanctions imposed by hostile forces is a vain hope. In the near future, the day will certainly come when we will settle the account for all damages caused to our peaceful economic development and to the improvement of our peopleâ??s lives. All of the sufferings of our innocent women, children and elderly caused by the heinous and barbaric sanctions against our Republic will one day be redressed. The Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea has established a Sanctions Damage Investigation Committee to make a comprehensive study of the total damages inflicted on our Republic by all forms of sanctions. The Committee will thoroughly investigate and compile all physical and moral damage imposed on my country by the United States and its followers, including by those that have submitted to United States coercion. When the pressure caused by this sanctions racket reaches a critical point and drives the Korean peninsula into an uncontrollable situation, the investigation results of this Committee will provide an evidentiary basis for holding those responsible accountable. My delegation takes this opportunity to extend its strong support to and solidarity with the Cuban Government and the people who are fighting to defend their national sovereignty and realize international justice against the high-handedness and arbitrariness in the form of the unilateral embargo by the United States. We also express strong support to and solidarity with the Government and the people of Venezuela, who are fighting to defend their national sovereignty and the cause of socialism. Such unjust and contemptible acts as the turning of a blind eye to Israelâ??s heinous acts while condemning in every possible way the Syrian Government for fighting to protect its national sovereignty and security should no longer be tolerated. In conclusion, the Government of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea will defend its national peace and security using its powerful nuclear deterrent and will contribute to safeguarding world peace and security.",1,196
7844,Session 72 - 2017,PRT_72_2017.txt,PRT_72_2017,72,2017,PRT,"Let me start by expressing Portugalâ??s condolences to and solidarity with the people and the Government of Mexico for yesterdayâ??s violent tragedy. I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. I welcome the priorities that you have established. Portugal fully supports an agenda centred around people and the right that we all have to live a dignified life in peace on a sustainable planet. I also wish to express a word of appreciation to your predecessor, whose dedication and successes we most readily acknowledge. I feel deeply moved to address the peoplesâ?? Assembly today in the presence of the first Portuguese Secretary-General of the United Nations. Before the Assembly, I solemnly pledge Portugalâ??s commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism, founded on the primacy of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The priorities of the Secretary-General are the same as ours: for a United Nations that is stronger, offers greater solidarity and is capable of preventing conflicts, alleviating human suffering and promoting peace and prosperity â?? a more transparent United Nations that is more effective and more adaptable to a constantly changing world. We welcome and support the dynamism that he has shown right from the start of his mandate in reforming the United Nations system so that it may better fulfil its noble purpose. Only the United Nations holds a universal vocation to respond, in concert with Member States, to the increasingly complex challenges of our time. Reforming the peace and security architecture is an absolute priority. Consolidating a culture of conflict prevention requires action across the board and an integrated vision of the three pillars of the United Nations system â?? peace, human rights and sustainable development â?? as well as closer institutional cooperation among the principal organs of the Charter, particularly the Security Council and the General Assembly. Achieving sustainable peace will require greater synergies in the Organizationâ??s structures and missions on the ground. The ongoing efforts should also give fresh impetus to reform of the Security Council to ensure better representation of todayâ??s world. The African continent cannot be denied a permanent presence, while Brazil and India are also two inescapable examples of necessart representation. On the other hand, the complexity of the global problems we face requires us to foster partnerships, involving not only States but also civil societies, international financial institutions and public and private entities. In that connection, I recall resolution 71/324, on cooperation between the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, adopted a few days ago, which specifically aims to strengthen the complementarities between the two organizations. I would also like to underscore the importance of the Portuguese language, which is today an instrument of communication with a global dimension. By the middle of this century, there will be almost 400 million speakers of the Portuguese language. That is what justified its adoption as an official language in several international organizations. The acceptance of Portuguese as one of the official languages of the United Nations remains a common stance of the member States of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. The Secretary-General has chosen diplomacy for peace as one of the main flags of his mandate. This idea must guide us as an international community as we react to the conflicts and crises that regrettably occur today in various parts of the world. The unity and firmness of the international community, embodied in the United Nations, in defence of law and in the promotion of security and stability is what enables us to move towards a fairer international order and to find the best solutions to the serious crises we face today â?? from North Korean threats to the situation in Syria, from the instability in Libya to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and so many other sources of confrontation, security risks or humanitarian tragedy. Terrorism is a global threat that challenges all of us. Portugal strongly and unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism and emphasizes the importance of preventing and fighting radicalization, violent extremism and recruitment. It actively participates in the struggle against terrorism, notably within the framework of the Global Coalition against Daâ??esh. We welcome the military successes achieved in Iraq over the past year. We all know that promoting peace and security goes hand in hand with promoting development. The two dimensions complement and strengthen each other. For that reason, diplomatic mediation efforts and peace operations in conflict zones also require humanitarian support, development cooperation and institutional capacity-building for affected populations and States. One of the clearest priorities of Portuguese foreign policy is participation in peacekeeping operations and institution-building within the framework of the United Nations. As a European and Atlantic country with deep historical and cultural links to Africa, Portugal pays particular attention to partnerships between the two continents. The first Summit between Europe and Africa took place in 2000, under the Portuguese presidency of the European Union. The fifth European Union-African Union Summit, to be held in Abidjan in November, will be an excellent opportunity to better define the priorities of the strategic partnership between the European Union and the African continent. The chosen theme â?? Youth â?? allows a much-needed integrated approach that addresses issues of education and employment, demographic dynamics and economic growth, gender equality and civic participation. The African continent has made important progress in recent years. We welcome the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. There are many signs of hope, both politically and economically. The successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be another important step in that sense. However, several disturbing issues still need to be overcome, and Portugal strives to do its part. First, we participate in various peacekeeping and stabilization operations within the framework of the United Nations and the European Union. In that way, we have reinforced our presence, without ever restricting the use of our troops, in the multilateral missions in the Sahel and Central Africa region, namely, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Missions in Mali and in the Central African Republic. Secondly, Portugal cooperates with several African partners in promoting maritime security, particularly in the Gulf of Guinea, to combat piracy and trafficking in people, drugs and weapons and to protect international trade from a strategic point of view for both Africa and Europe. Peace and sustainable development are built on respect for the rights and dignity of human beings. Portugal defends human rights diplomacy. For us, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are inseparable and interdependent. They apply universally and do not depend on place, history or the religious or civilizational matrix of a society. Upholding those rights is a task for all of us, one which requires dialogue and concerted action. That is the only way human rights will be made universal. Our mandate in the Human Rights Council, which ends this year, was guided by those principles, and they will continue to guide us in the future. In 2017, we celebrate 150 years since the abolition of the death penalty in Portugal. We have been pioneers in that cause and will continue to stand for the universal abolition of capital punishment. The situation of migrants and refugees remains on the agenda. We have a moral obligation to protect and promote the rights of those who, like so many others before them, are forced to leave their homes and families in search of security and a better future. That is the principle that should serve as the basis for the global compact that last year we pledged to prepare and approve. In that context, I underline the work of the Global Platform for Syrian Students, an initiative of the former President of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio. The Platform guarantees access to higher education for young Syrians who, because of the conflict in their country, have been deprived of that universal right. I invite all countries that have not yet done so to join the Platform and support the Rapid Response Mechanism for Higher Education in Emergencies. The war cannot lead to the loss of yet another generation of Syrian youth, who have the right to education. For peace and development to be truly sustainable, we must show respect for our common home and future generations. To protect and preserve the planet is to nurture peace and prevent new conflicts that are caused by competition in accessing diminishing resources. In that regard, the Paris Agreement is a milestone in reducing the impacts of climate change. We cannot do without the universal instrument if we are to achieve the objectives of the environmental pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Portugal will comply with the European Unionâ??s voluntary commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, and will contribute to the Green Climate Fund, which is in place to help developing countries adapt to climate change. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are the most powerful statement of our multilateral commitment to the rights of people, the quality of life of populations and the future of our planet. Portugal stands for those Goals, which guide us both in our domestic policy and in our foreign and cooperation efforts. All 17 Goals are very important to us. However, because of our history and the international action on the preservation and enhancement of marine resources, we believe that Goal 14, on oceans, is the one to which our participation can bring greater added value, within the framework of the United Nations. Oceans â?? source of life, knowledge and so many resources and exchanges â?? make up 71 per cent of the surface of our planet and are a top priority in any strategy for sustainable development. The need for action is pressing and wide-ranging, as was evident a week ago in Lisbon in another oceans meeting, this year dedicated to the theme â??The Ocean and Human Healthâ??. It was promoted by Portugal, and dozens of countries participated. In 2017, the first United Nations conference dedicated to conservation and sustainable exploitation of the oceans took place. It was a privilege for Portugal to participate in the preparatory process for the conference as co-facilitator, along with Singapore, of the political document that resulted from it: â??Our ocean, our future: call for actionâ??. I reiterate my countryâ??s willingness to host the follow-up conference in 2020. In our view, the sustainability of oceans requires a strengthening of their governance. For that reason, we believe that the General Assembly should formally decide on the beginning of negotiations, starting in 2018, of a new legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. However many the challenges we face today and however serious the risks and threats that afflict us, we are certain to make progress when we have clear goals and know how to establish partnerships to reach them. Multilateralism is the only framework for the defence of the common good of humankind and the collective promotion of peace, security and development. In no way does multilateralism diminish the sovereignty of nations or the capacity for decisions of peoples and institutions. The fraternal cooperation promoted by multilateralism contributes to our strengths with the strengths of those who follow the same path and direction. We know the way and direction to take. Our way is that of the United Nations and our direction is the agenda of the United Nations. Diplomacy for peace, diplomacy for human rights, the climate agenda, the 2030 Agenda â?? my country is part of and contributes",1,196
7845,Session 72 - 2017,PRY_72_2017.txt,PRY_72_2017,72,2017,PRY,"On behalf of the Paraguayan people and the Government of Paraguay, I hope that under the presidency of Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k the General Assembly will have great success in fulfilling the purposes of the United Nations. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Paraguay, I wish to express to the people and the Government of Mexico our solidarity with the victims of yesterdayâ??s earthquake, whose epicentre was in Morelos state, and to extend our sincerest condolences to the families of the victims of the tragedy. After four years as Head of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay, I have the honour of participating in the General Assembly with strengthened resolve to contribute to building a world order governed by the principles of justice, peace and solidarity among nations and within an effective framework of human rights, State institutions and the rule of law. We must persist in our efforts to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of all States and to build a democratic and equitable world order, while developing relations among sovereign, independent States based on respect and trust and prioritizing the peaceful coexistence whereby all nations can enjoy the same opportunities. To that end, we need the bodies of the United Nations, particularly the General Assembly and the Security Council, to work efficiently. We seek a more democratic, transparent, inclusive and representative Security Council that reflects the diversity of the States Members of the United Nations and the geopolitical realities of todayâ??s world. The Organization continues to be the most important universal forum for tackling global challenges. Problems such as poverty and inequality, climate change, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking â?? which undermines democratic institutions â?? and terrorism, among others, must be dealt with collectively. We urge all stakeholders to focus their efforts and resources on responding to these shared and pressing challenges faced by humankind. The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its firm commitment to implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and encourages other States, particularly those that are most responsible for producing greenhouse gases, to take all necessary measures to save our planet from the consequences of global warming. In Paraguay, our vision of social responsibility is behind our efforts to increase our production of clean and renewable energy. We have two impressive hydraoelectric dams â?? Itaipu, which we share with Brazil, and Yacyreta, shared with Argentina. This year, Itaipu Binacional was incorporated into the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves, as was the Alto ParanÃ¡ Atlantic forest. My mandate as President of my country comes to an end in August 2018. This is my final address to the United Nations, and I would like to mention several improvements that we have made since I took office in 2013. Today Paraguay is a full representative democracy with a true separation of powers, solid electoral processes and a fully effective rule of law. We have given clear signals to the international community, both publicly and privately, on our countryâ??s improved potential as an investment vehicle, in the area of cooperation and with regard to treaties. Where foreign relations and Paraguayâ??s role in the world are concerned, our interactions have grown exponentially through visits and invitations received as well as participation in international organizations. Over the past four years, our country has had official visits from His Holiness Pope Francis, former Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Rusâ??, as well as other top officials from multilateral organizations and various Heads of State and international eminent persons who have honoured us with their presence. Paraguay was unanimously admitted to the Development Centre of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For us, our membership of that highly prestigious global organization is an unequivocal sign of international recognition of our Governmentâ??s efforts and achievements through our policies of good practices and institutional robustness. We can proudly say that Paraguay is a member of that select OECD group in an affirmation of the international communityâ??s confidence in the significant reforms undertaken by our Government. Today we are members of the World Intellectual Property Organization Advisory Committee on Enforcement, following years of mistrust of our country regarding respect for intellectual property rights. We have decided to take on additional memberships in international bodies in order to be part of discussions and decision-making, with a view to continually expanding our global presence. The role of Paraguay in the world today transcends borders and continents. Our priorities within the framework of the United Nations have been established in the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We therefore urge States, especially our trading partners and transit countries, to duly take those into account. Regional integration has undeniable benefits, especially when we work to achieve it while endeavouring to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. We are therefore working in the Southern Common Market to revitalize economic and commercial integration while also making progress on the social, employment, scientific and cultural aspects of the bloc, which represents a very positive agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sutainable Development is the most ambitious intergovernmental development project in the multilateral sphere. In order to properly implement our national development plan through 2030, we are building an innovative, participatory institutional architecture that is committed to the Agendaâ??s Goals and targets. I am proud to say that, together with the Presidents of our Congress and Supreme Court of Justice, I have publicly signed a joint cross-branch declaration that recognizes Paraguayâ??s absolute commitment to the terms of the 2030 Agenda and its Goals and targets. Paraguay has thus declared itself in favour of the 2030 Agenda through its three State branches, an event previously unheard of in our region. During these past four years, the Administration I lead has responded justly and effectively to the needs of all sectors of society. When we first came to power, in August 2013, we established three main national policies â?? poverty reduction through social development; inclusive economic growth; and the expansion of Paraguayâ??s role in the world. As we implemented those policies, we transformed a culture previously marred by political cronyism and bad practices into a model based on transparency and compliance, where public access to information is guaranteed and more opportunities are offered to our people. Access to public information has led to unprecedented progress, and today we have instruments ensuring that public business is conducted in public. We are undergoing an unprecedented transformation, and although it has triggered some concerns, reactions and resistance from those who were more comfortable with the former model, I can guarantee that it is closing the door on such evils as corruption, which delayed Paraguayâ??s economic and social development for many years. Despite regional economic problems, we have been able to achieve sustained economic growth, and we hope to continue improving our ability to forge relationships throughout the world by being trustworthy and predictable. Paraguayâ??s economic growth in recent years has been constant, and at an annual average of 5.2 per cent is one of the highest in South America. While we are also working to reduce the poverty rate, years of neglect in the past have made eradicating poverty altogether a major challenge. Our priorities have been focused on giving a strong impetus to social investment, particularly in education, so that people living in poverty can benefit from economic growth and to help reduce inequality. We are implementing flagship social-protection programmes such as the TekoporÃ£ conditional cash-transfer programme, a school meal programme, food allowances for elderly adults living in poverty and the Sowing Opportunities poverty-reduction programme. In addition, we are increasing our grants of scholarships and financial aid to young people living in poverty, in the firm belief that education and professional training for young people represent the best possible investment for the countryâ??s future. After 175 years, the Paraguayan Government is once again granting postgraduate scholarships for study abroad at the worldâ??s best universities, with a record investment of $42 million. Thanks to the Carlos Antonio LÃ³pez scholarships, 1,000 Paraguayans from the countryâ??s 17 departments and its capital are doing postgraduate studies in 50 of the worldâ??s 200 most prestigious universities. Hundreds of them are teachers and 60 per cent are women under 30 years old. The first 60 have successfully completed their studies and are returning to apply their knowledge for our countryâ??s benefit and development. Another of our national strategic goals in combating poverty focuses on housing programmes designed to offer citizens decent homes, revive the economy and create jobs. In the past four years we have worked hard, transparently and responsibly, with unprecedented results. For the first time in Paraguayâ??s history, by the end of its term a single Government will have delivered on its promise of more than 30,000 public housing units, 10 times more than any previous Administration, and even more valuable because they benefit thousands of families that for years were ignored by previous Governments and now have decent homes and access to better conditions in which to thrive. We are building hope and opportunities so that families in Paraguayâ??s humblest communities â?? whether in poor urban areas, indigenous regions or rural villages â?? can move forward. We are transforming our country through transparent and efficient efforts that enable us to make the most of our resources while reducing expenses, eliminating corruption in projects and improving construction quality through rigorous controls. My Government encourages productive development through responsible investment. We give priority to infrastructure projects that improve connectivity, both nationally and with neighbouring countries. In particular, investment in infrastructure is at its highest in decades, and the scope and modernity of our new road construction is outstanding. We demand responsibility and commitment from our leaders and have worked hard to achieve good standards of living for our people. Thanks to this new model for Government efforts, our country is becoming more efficient, progressive and honest. The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to international peace and security and the use of peaceful means to resolve conflicts, based on mutual cooperation between States. Our Constitution bans weapons of mass destruction, and we therefore welcome the recent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and reaffirm our belief that the nuclear-disarmament process should be transparent and irreversible, with effective verification mechanisms based on a universal, legally binding framework. We reiterate our condemnation of the nuclear test by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea in clear defiance and breach of its international obligations, constituting yet another provocation to the international community. We hope that the General Assembly will firmly reject such irrational behaviour, which threatens security and peace on a global scale. The Republic of Paraguay is deeply concerned about the scourge of terrorism, which we condemn in any shape or form. The fight against terrorism must be carried out within a framework of unconditional respect for the precepts of international law, through solid cooperation among States. We will continue to collaborate with peacekeeping operations organized under the auspices of the United Nations, in the belief that they can enable us to achieve the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. My country is currently contributing military personnel, both women and men, to six peacekeeping missions, and invests in the training of its contingents at our peacekeeping operations training centre. We also reaffirm our commitment to the promotion and effective protection of human rights throughout the world. We firmly believe that we should protect the dignity and rights of all people, without discrimination. We urge the Human Rights Council to continue to fulfil its functions with objectivity, impartiality and universality. In this context, I should not omit to mention a worrying issue in my region, which is that the situation in Venezuela needs urgent attention. I would like to reiterate a message of solidarity to the people of Venezuela, victims of political persecution and human rights violations, in the hope that our brother nation can find a solution to its current democratic breakdown and deep crisis as soon as possible. Through international cooperation, the Republic of China on Taiwan has long been engaged in cooperation programmes related to the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. It supports many countries, including Paraguay. Taiwan has relevant knowledge and experience and has contributed effectively to the international community. The Government of Paraguay once again urges all Member States to identify appropriate ways to facilitate Taiwanâ??s participation in the mechanisms for meetings and activities of the United Nations system, so that its 23 million inhabitants can exercise their responsibilities normally as global citizens and establish sustainable alliances with every country. In our view, Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has made an auspicious start at the helm of the United Nations, supported by his vast experience as a statesman. It will be up to the Heads of State of member countries during this session to ensure that it can be a starting point of a new era for the true universalization of the principles guiding the functioning of the Organization, particularly so that its programmes and actions can reduce the enormous inequalities that still exist between countries and regions. I reaffirm that my country will continue to give high priority to its participation in United Nations debates, in our belief in the importance of the Organizationâ??s work in building a more peaceful and just world. For our part, we will continue to work resolutely towards development with true social inclusion, creating conditions for prosperity and always putting people first. I would like to conclude with an exhortation from Pope Francis: â??Let us never forget that authentic power is service.â??",1,196
7846,Session 72 - 2017,PSE_72_2017.txt,PSE_72_2017,72,2017,PSE,"Twenty- four years have passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords, an interim agreement that set a five-year period for bringing an end to the Israeli occupation, giving hope to the Palestinian people that they would soon achieve independence within their State and peace between Palestinians and Israelis. What is left of that hope today? We recognized the State of Israel within the 1967 borders, but Israelâ??s continued refusal to do the same has called into question the mutual recognition that we signed in Oslo in 1993. Since my address to the Assembly last year (see A/71/PV.14), when I urged us to make 2017 the year for ending the Israeli occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine, the Israeli Government has relentlessly pursued its settlement campaign on our land, in contravention of all international conventions and the relevant resolutions on the question of Palestine. It has also persisted in its flagrant disregard for reaching a 17-29395 7/29 two-State solution, resorting to delaying policies and tactics and devising pretexts to evade its responsibility for ending its occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine. Instead of addressing the underlying issues and resolving the root causes of the conflict, it has tried to divert international attention to secondary issues that in fact are caused by its colonial policies. While we continue to call â?? as does the international community â?? for an end to the Israeli occupation of our Stateâ??s territory, Israel incites trouble and makes false accusations, pretends that there is no Palestinian partner and imposes unreasonable, obstructive conditions. Israel is well aware, as we all are, that its occupation breeds provocations and violence. Its military occupation of our land has now lasted for more than half a century. Ten years ago, in a decision made by the United States, we agreed together to establish a tripartite committee to address the issue of incitement, made up of the United States, Palestine and Israel. The committee worked for some time but was eventually disbanded, and since then we have called for its revival, to no avail. Who is committing incitement now? And who is trying to maintain it? It is therefore very strange to hear some of those who should be responsible for ending the occupation refer to it as a half-occupation, or an alleged occupation. What is meant by â??alleged occupationâ??? For 50 years we have languished under the yoke of occupation, and now someone who is responsible says that this is an alleged occupation. That is unfair, wrong and unacceptable. Israelâ??s continuation of the occupation is an affront to the international community. The United Nations has a legal, political, moral and humanitarian obligation to end it and enable the Palestinian people to live in freedom and prosperity in their independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital and within the 4 June 1967 borders. That is the responsibility of the United Nations and the international community. There can be no doubt that draining the quagmire of the colonial occupation of our land and ending its unjust, oppressive and illegal practices against our people would have an enormous effect on the fight against terrorism, thereby depriving terrorist groups of one of the key rallying cries they exploit to promote their obscurantist ideas. We therefore reiterate that it is vitally urgent to end the Israeli occupation of our land, since it is an integral part of the efforts that we must all make to confront such groups. Palestinians oppose all internal and international terrorist organizations, whatever their nature, origins or character. We stand against international terrorism and we are fighting it. We have explored every avenue and exerted enormous efforts to achieve peace with our Israeli neighbours. Together with other Arab and Islamic States, we have adopted the invaluable Arab Peace Initiative, aimed at resolving the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. The Initiative states that upon Israelâ??s withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories â?? the Golan and Shabaâ??a farmlands â?? occupied since 1967, the Arab and Islamic States will recognize Israel and normalize relations with it. What has been the Israeli response? Fifty-seven Arab and Islamic States have said that they are ready to recognize and normalize relations with Israel, but Israel is not interested. In 2003, there was also the 2003 Quartet road map for an Israeli-Palestinian peace, endorsed by the Security Council and accepted by Palestine. It, too, was rejected by the Israeli Government â?? so apparently Israel is above the law. Next, a French-led initiative for peace attempted to break the stalemate in the peace process and ensure a successful effort to salvage the peace process and a two-State solution. It led to the convening earlier this year in Paris of the Conference for Peace in the Middle East, which was attended by 70 States and four international organizations. Israel has rejected and boycotted all of those efforts. Besides those I have already mentioned, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China have also launched initiatives for peace. The latest of those peace efforts â?? all of which we are grateful for â?? is being led by United States President Donald Trump. Where are those initiatives and why will Israel not accept them? For our part, we have also repeatedly tried to revive the peace process. We have called on the Israeli Prime Minister simply to affirm his commitment to a two- State solution and sit with us at the negotiation table to delineate the borders between Israel and the State of Palestine in order to open a path for meaningful talks on resolving all the other final status issues. Unfortunately, he rejected that offer. We have continued our genuine efforts to achieve a successful peace process, and Israel nonetheless continues to ignore its commitments and obstruct those efforts through its relentless settlement activities. There is no place left for the State of Palestine, and that is unacceptable both to us and to those here in this Hall. The fact is that Israel is rejecting a two-State solution, posing a real threat to Israelis and Palestinians alike. We will therefore be compelled to undertake a comprehensive strategic review of the entire process. A commitment to peace by one side is never enough to achieve peace. Either we are free or not free. We have issued warnings in the past, and continue to do so today, about the Israeli policies aimed at entrenching the occupation and colonial facts on the ground in East Jerusalem. We have pointed out that those policies fuel religious animosity and could lead to a violent religious conflict. We have called on the Israeli Government to uphold the historic and legal status quo of the cityâ??s holy sites. However, since its occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967, the Israeli Government has repeatedly and unilaterally annexed Jerusalem. Jerusalem is occupied. It also decided to annex Golan, and did so. We rejected that at the time and continue to do so, together with the entier international community, including the Security Council. The Security Council, the principal world authority on peace and security, has adopted numerous resolutions stating that such annexation processes are illegal. To whom should we turn? Since the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions are not being implemented, to whom should we turn? We have not chosen a path of terrorism or violence. Jerusalem is an occupied city. Israelâ??s decisions and practices there are null and void and entirely illegal. The same applies to all the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory. Israelâ??s attempts to change the historic status quo in Al-Quds and particularly the status and integrity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque can be described only as playing with fire and an infringement on our responsibilities and those of our brother country Jordan. We are both responsible for the city. We have warned the Israeli Government about the implications of such an act of aggression and will hold it fully responsible for the consequences. We do not desire a religious war, which would be dangerous for everyone. Our conflict is political, not religious, so let us leave religious issues out of the equation. Despite the ongoing occupation and its oppressive policies and practices, we have been working effectively to build the institutions of our State, which has been recognized by a majority â?? 138 of those present â?? of the States Members of the United Nations. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank all of the countries that have recognized the State of Palestine and have voted for upgrading its status at the United Nations. That is certainly helping to remedy the historic injustice that has befallen our people and showing support for the goal of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East and around the world. I also stressed in my address to the Assembly last year that the status quo in the occupied territory of the State of Palestine is unsustainable. However, since the situation has only deteriorated, owing to Israelâ??s insistence on pursuing its occupation, aggressive policies and unending violations of international law, we must once again call on Israel, as the occupying Power, to fully respect and uphold all the obligations that its occupation implies and bear the consequences. We cannot continue to be an Authority that has no authority or to allow the occupation to continue at no cost. We are fast approaching that point. If Israel does not want a two-State solution, if it does not want peace, let it assume its responsibilities and bear their consequences, because we will not bear those responsibilities for them. Today a two-State solution is in jeopardy. As Palestinians, we cannot stand still in the face of that threat, which is targeting our national, political and social existence on our land and endangering regional and international peace and security. We will have to take steps or look for alternatives in order to preserve our national existence and maintain the prospects for peace and security. But any option we try will be peaceful. In such a situation, we have the right to seek alternatives that preserve our rights and protect our land and our people from a hardening system of the type of apartheid that ended in South Africa long ago but that continues to persist in Palestine. Is that acceptable? Can the world accept an apartheid regime in the twenty-first century in Palestine? Why, then, is there one? On the other hand, we have called on the International Criminal Court, which is our right. If nobody wants to listen to us, then we will pursue all avenues to justice. We have called on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people. We will continue to pursue our accessions to international conventions, protocols and organizations, as Palestine has acquired observer status pursuant to resolution of 2012. I will convene the Palestinian National Council in the near future to operationalize a strategic review of these efforts. Palestinians, Arabs and the world as a whole have a choice as to whether to respect international law and implement the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. We will give the efforts being undertaken by President Donald Trump, the Quartet and the international community at large every chance to succeed so that a historic agreement or deal may be reached. We have heard that they are trying to strike a historic deal. We would like to thank them and hope that it will come to fruition soon. We stress the two-State solution, which would enable the State of Palestine to live side-by-side with the State of Israel in security and peace. But if the two-State solution were to be fall apart due to the establishment of a one-State reality with two systems â?? a system of apartheid â?? following the unchecked imposition of the occupation that our people and the international community reject, that would be a failure, and neither the international community nor we will have any other choice but to continue the struggle and demand full and equal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine. This is not a threat, but we are warning Israel of the realities and the consequences of its ongoing policies that are gravely undermining the two-State solution. What do the Israelis want? Even if they talk about other issues, we continue to choose the two-State solution. Our problem is with the Israeli colonial occupation, not with Judaism as a religion. Judaism for us Palestinians, be they Christian or Muslim, will never be considered a threat. It is an Abrahamic religion, like Islam and Christianity. God Almighty tells us in the Qurâ??an that, in the name of God the Compassionate and the Merciful, we should not distinguish between his messengers. Indeed, all His messengers â?? Mohammed, Jesus and others â?? are equal. All these religions are equal, and we do not make distinctions between prophets or messengers. On this occasion, we congratulate the Jews on their new year. We would also like to congratulate Muslims for their new Hijri year starting tomorrow. This is proof of our desire for a rapprochement among religions. We have dutifully upheld our responsibilities towards our people in the Gaza Strip despite the split with Hamas that has been in place since 2007. Since that time, we have provided all forms of support on our own to our people in Gaza, who are gravely suffering from the cruel Israeli blockade. We have repeatedly affirmed that no one is more aware of the interests of our people in Gaza Strip than we are. We are eager to see to the interests of the people in Gaza served. We have said that there will be no State in Gaza alone and there will be no Palestinian State without the Gaza Strip. A State in Gaza alone is a false dream, and our State will be complete only when the Gaza Strip is part of it. I must express my relief at the agreement reached in Cairo as a result of Egyptian efforts. We are grateful for those efforts aimed at nullifying the measures taken by Hamas following the split with us, including the formation of a Government. The Hamas Government has been cancelled, and there is now a commitment to the National Unity Government, which is a Government of national consensus, which will enable it to exercise its authority in the Gaza Strip and allow for general elections to be held. This agreement has met with our satisfaction. Next week, our Government is going to the Gaza Strip to assume its responsibilities. We wish the Government every success. In my address to the General Assembly last year, I appealed to the Government of the United Kingdom to rectify the grave injustice it inflicted upon the Palestinian people when, in 1917, it issued the Balfour Declaration, promising Jews a national homeland in Palestine, despite the fact that Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people. Some 97 per cent of the population of Palestine at that time were Palestinians, who were disregarded. Again, Palestine at that time was inhabited by the Palestinian people and was among the most progressive and prosperous countries in the region. It should not have been colonized or placed under the mandate of a great Power. The British Government has not taken a single step to date to correct this historical injustice against our people. It should apologize, provide us with reparations and recognize the State of Palestine. We talked to its representatives at length and so far they have not provided a response. What is even worse is that in November they want to celebrate the centenary of this crime against our people. The silence of the international community with respect to Israelâ??s aggressive policies has emboldened the country to continue its policies. I would remind the Assembly that, since its establishment, Israel has violated numerous provisions of international law. It has violated the Charter of the United Nations and continues to do so. It has violated General Assembly resolutions 181 (II), 194 (III) and Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We would recall that Article 42 of the Charter of the United Nations provides for the possible use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security. This could apply to those who conduct acts of aggression against the land of others. Israel has taken a large part of our territory and was not deterred from doing so by the United Nations. Resolution 194 (III) provided for the return of refugees at that time. However, the United Nations did not adopt any follow-up resolution. Security Council resolutions have called for withdrawal from the occupied territories. Where are those resolutions? If the United Nations cannot implement its resolutions, who will? Israel does not want to. Is Israel above the law? There are double standards in dealing with different countries. That is the Assemblyâ??s responsibility. To salvage the peace process and the two-State solution, I urge the Organization and its Member States to adopt the following measures. First, they should actively pursue efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the State of Palestine within a set time frame. It is no longer enough to issue generic statements calling for the end to the occupation and the achievement of peace without a deadline. Efforts must be made to implement the Arab Peace Initiative, including a just solution for the Palestinian refugee question, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). The Arab Peace Initiative addressed the issue of refugees very well in referring to a just and agreed- upon solution, not one imposed upon a certain party, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). Israel disregarded those resolutions, riding roughshod over them. To whom should we complain? Second, they should act to bring to a halt to all settlement activities in occupied Palestinian land, as demanded in numerous United Nations resolutions, including the most recent Security Council resolution, 2334 (2016), in addition to the operative paragraphs of the Fourth Geneva Convention. An occupying Power should not expel the people from their land. This is in the text of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Who is responsible for implementing those texts? Israel refuses to do so. What is the international community doing? Third, the Organization and Member States should ensure international protection to the lands and people of the State of Palestine until the occupation ends, as we are unable to provide protection to our people. Given all the forces, the arms that we are facing every day, who will protect us if the Member States do not? Many times we have put forward draft resolutions, but they are in vain. Fourth, they should demand that Israel endorse and commit to the borders of 1967 as the basis for the two-State solution and set such borders in line with international resolutions. Once we delineate the borders, each party can act in its territory as it pleases without affecting or damaging the rights of the other party. Israel builds wherever it wants today, demolishing houses every day; even schools and hospitals are being demolished. Nobody raises an eyebrow. Fifth, I must ask all the Member States of the United Nations that have recognized Israel to state that they have recognized Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders, thereby aligning themselves with international resolutions and reaffirming their commitment to those resolutions â?? even those who recognized Israel on the basis of resolution 181 (II). Resolution 181 (II) was violated. Hence my question: where are the borders of Israel that Member States are recognizing? How can Member States recognize a State that has no borders? Israel has not even decided on its own borders. Yet international law states that a State is a land with borders. But Israel has no borders. How can one recognize a State that has no clearly demarcated borders? Sixth, I call on all States to end all forms of direct and indirect involvement with, and support to, the illegal Israeli colonial settlement regime on the land of the occupied State of Palestine, in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the affirmed positions of States in that regard. Such action would be similar to the international communityâ??s approach to the apartheid regime in South Africa. We should not deal with settlements. We should not condone settlements. The black list of countries that are dealing illegally with Israeli settlements should be exposed. Seventh, I urge those States that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. I do not understand how recognizing the State of Palestine within the 1967 borders harms the chances of peace. There could be minor amendments agreed between the two parties, but the basis is 1967, so our borders are well known. Where are the borders of Israel? How can recognizing the State of Palestine harm the chances of peace, especially since we Palestinians have recognized the State of Israel within the 1967 borders? Eighth, we look to the Security Council to approve our application for full membership of the State of Palestine in the United Nations. What do we lack? What is missing? Every day we prove that we are eligible for such status. All those who support the two-State solution should recognize two States, not one State â?? Palestine and Israel. If a Member State recognizes Israel, it should recognize Palestine. Ninth, we urge the international community to continue providing economic and financial support to the Palestinian people to achieve self-reliance. If the occupation ends we will say â??thank youâ??. We will be self-reliant. Unfortunately, because we are under occupation, we can only seek assistance, and we are grateful to the international community because it is providing assistance. Help us to rid ourselves of the occupation, and we will thank Member States for their help. We also urge the international community to continue providing support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to enable it to continue providing humanitarian assistance. In that connection, we warn against attempts to eliminate item 7 on the agenda of the Human Rights Council, or to change the mandate of UNRWA. Efforts are also under way to obstruct the issuance of the list of companies operating in Israeli settlements. That is a black list. Why should we hide that list? It is similar to terrorism. Everybody should see the list to know who violates international law and who respects such law. Tenth, we once again affirm our commitment to respecting human rights and international conventions, and to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and all other treaties and conventions that we have acceded to. We respect everything that we have acceded to or adopted, and we go hand in hand with the international community, of which we are part of. The State of Palestine will reflect those imperatives, where appropriate, in the draft resolutions to be presented to the General Assembly. We call on the Assembly to vote in favour of those draft resolutions, with the clear aim of preserving the two-State solution, salvaging and promoting peace and achieving security and stability and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians and for the people of the entire region. In conclusion, allow me to salute our great people, who remain steadfast in their homeland despite their suffering and peaceful struggle against foreign occupation. The culture of peace is prevailing among Palestinians. Those joining Daâ??esh and the Al-Nusra Front are not from Palestine. I salute our people of Jerusalem, who exhibited one of the most shining examples of peaceful popular resistance against the Israeli colonial occupation. When they were prevented from praying, they prayed outside â?? they prayed and were victorious. I salute our people in exile and in the diaspora. I salute our people who remain steadfast in the West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip. I salute our glorious martyrs and our courageous prisoners in Israeli prisons. I tell them all that freedom is coming and is inevitable and that the occupation will come to an end. That will come about either with the independence of the State of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel on the 1967 borders, or, if Israel chooses, with equal rights for all of the inhabitants of the land of historic Palestine from the river to the sea. Which will they accept? When South Africa was liberated from the apartheid regime, Nelson Mandela said that he was grateful to the whole world and the United Nations, which contributed to and supported the end of apartheid in South Africa. Mandela added that their victory would not be complete until the Palestinian people were victorious. We, together with the Assembly, are entrusted to end the apartheid in Palestine â?? person by person, State by State, including the super-Powers. All of us should stand together. It is a commitment that should be fulfilled. Will the Assembly fulfil its duty? I very much hope so.",1,196
7847,Session 72 - 2017,QAT_72_2017.txt,QAT_72_2017,72,2017,QAT,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We wish him every success in his mandate. I also wish to express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his valuable efforts in managing the affairs of the General Assembly during the seventy-first session. I also take this opportunity to commend the efforts of His Excellency Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres to strengthen the role of the United Nations. Maintaining regional and international peace and security is a priority in the foreign policy of the State of Qatar, which bases its principles and objectives on the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. It calls for constructive cooperation among States, mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs, as well as good-neighbourliness and the promotion of peaceful coexistence, while pursuing peaceful means to settle disputes. The issue of settling disputes by peaceful means is still being addressed as an episodic and non-binding proposal. Perhaps the time has come to impose dialogue and negotiation as a basis for resolving disputes by concluding an international convention on settling disputes between States by peaceful means. In that context, and after major events such as the Second World War, Rwanda and Burundi and the Balkan conflicts in the past century, the danger of the impunity of perpetrators of crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide has returned to threaten humankind by becoming the rule rather than the exception, because international legitimacy is subjected to political pressure, the interests of parties and the dictation of force on the ground, which maintain that the law of force is able to supersede the force of law. In our view, major Powers should not range between two extremes: the direct occupation of countries to impose the occupierâ??s will and policy, or standing idly by as an observer who does nothing with regard to wars of genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated by fascist, despotic regimes, or to continuous repression by an occupying State of the people under occupation. Lately there has been a growing sense that people under repression face their fate alone, as if the international arena were governed by the law of the jungle and the countries under threat had to stand on their own through help from their alliances and relations, in the absence of a system to implement the provisions of international law and binding conventions and charters. We commend the President for the theme chosen for this session, that is, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. In that context, I call upon the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and the international community to assume their legal and moral responsibility and take the measures necessary to stop the violence against the Rohingya minority, provide them with protection, repatriate the displaced to their homeland, prevent sectarian or ethnic discrimination against them and ensure that they have their full legitimate rights as full-fledged citizens. We urge all States to provide humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya. Every time I stand here, I speak in favour of constructive international cooperation, just peace and the rights of peoples under occupation, those who are subjected to crimes against humanity and those who are under siege. This time I stand here while my country and my people are subjected to a continuing and unjust blockade, imposed since 5 June by our neighbouring countries. The blockade involves all aspects of life, including intervention by those countries to sever family ties. At the moment Qatar is successfully managing its life â?? its economy, development plans and its outreach to the wider world â?? thanks to sea and air routes that those countries do not control. The blockade was imposed abruptly and without warning, prompting Qataris to consider it as a kind of betrayal. It seems that those who planned and implemented it had envisaged that their action would cause a shocking and direct impact that would bring the State of Qatar to its knees and cause it to capitulate to a total guardianship imposed upon it. What is worse, those who schemed for the blockade found it necessary to rely on fabricated quotes attributed to me, which they posted on the Qatar News Agency website after hacking it. The controlled media of those countries were ready to launch an all-out campaign of incitement, prepared in advance, in which all values, morals and norms were breached, while a torrent of lies infringed upon the truth. Funds are still being spent unsparingly on the machine faking news and disseminating fabrications in the hope of fooling people by distorting the truth with plain lies. Despite the exposure of the hacking and falsification of quotes by the Amir of a sovereign State, the blockading countries did not back down or apologize for lying, but rather intensified their campaign, in the hope that the blockade would cause a cumulative effect on the economy and the society of my country, after it failed to have any direct impact. The perpetrators of the hacking and the falsified quotes have committed an assault against a sovereign State. The crime was deliberately committed for political aims and was followed by a list of political declarations, which contravene sovereignty. They caused worldwide astonishment. This disgraceful act has once again raised international questions about digital security, cybercrime and electronic piracy. It has also revealed the anxiety in many public and official circles around the world over the absence of clear-cut international legislation and institutions to govern this dangerous and vital field, or to punish the perpetrators of transnational crimes. It is high time to take steps in this regard. We are ready to mobilize our potential to serve in such a joint effort. The countries that imposed the unjust blockade on Qatar have intervened in the internal affairs of the State by putting pressure on the citizens through food, medicine and family ties, with a view to forcing them to change their political affiliation so as to destabilize a sovereign country. Is this not one of the definitions of terrorism? This illegal blockade was not confined to the economic field and to breaching the World Trade Organization agreement, but went beyond that to violate human rights conventions by arbitrary measures that have caused social and religious harm to thousands of citizens and residents of the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council by violating the basic human rights to work, education and the freedom of movement and the right to private property. However, things did not stop at that point, as the blockading countries went on to persecute their own citizens on their own territories and to impose penalties of imprisonment and fines on them for the mere expression of their sympathy with the State of Qatar, even on social media. That was unprecedented, and it violates the human rights conventions and agreements that guarantee the right to the freedom of opinion and expression. There are countries that not only attack a neighbouring country so as to dictate its foreign policy and media policy, but also believe that having a lot of money qualifies them to put pressure on other countries and blackmail them to participate in their aggression, while they are supposed to be held accountable internationally for what they have committed. The countries that imposed the blockade on the State of Qatar are interfering in the internal affairs of many countries and accuse all those who oppose them, domestically or abroad, of terrorism. Thus they are harming the war on terror, while at the same time opposing reform and supporting the tyrannical regimes in our region, in whose prisons terrorists are born. We were not alone in being taken by surprise by the imposition of the blockade, as many countries whose leaders have questioned its motives and reasons were also surprised. The blockading countries have promised all those who asked them about the reasons for the blockade to provide them with evidence of their absurd anti-Qatar allegations and fabrications, which keep changing according to the identity of the person being asked. Everyone is still waiting for evidence, which has not arrived and will not arrive â?? because it does not exist. On the contrary, those allegations contradict the considerable evidence about Qatarâ??s contribution to the fight against terrorism, which is recognized by the entire international community. The State of Qatar has fought terrorism, and the entire international community bears witness to that. It is still fighting terrorism and will continue to do so. It stands in the camp of those who are fighting by security means and believes that it is necessary to fight terrorism ideologically as well. Qatar goes beyond that to participate in drying up its sources by providing education to 7 million children around the world, so that they do not fall prey to ignorance and radical ideas. We have refused to yield to dictation by pressure and blockade, and our people will not be satisfied with anything less. At the same time, we have taken an open attitude towards dialogue without dictation and have expressed our readiness to resolve differences through compromises based on common undertakings. Resolving conflicts by peaceful means is one of the priorities of our foreign policy. I renew here the call for an unconditional dialogue based on mutual respect for sovereignty. I highly value the sincere and appreciated mediation that the State of Qatar has supported since the beginning of the crisis, which was initiated by my brother, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait. I also thank all the countries that have supported this mediation. Allow me on this occasion to express here my pride in my Qatari people, along with the multinational and multicultural residents of Qatar. The people have withstood the conditions of siege, rejected dictation with resolve and pride, insisted on the independence of Qatarâ??s sovereign decision and strengthened its unity and solidarity, while maintaining their refined manners and their progress despite the fierceness of the campaign launched against them and their country. I reiterate my thanks to the sisterly and friendly countries that recognize the significance of respecting the sovereignty of States and the rule of international law, while also appreciating their stance of remaining supportive of the Qatari people during this crisis. Terrorism and extremism are among the most serious challenges facing the world. Countering them requires us all to carry out concerted action against terrorist organizations and their extremist ideology, in order to maintain security for humankind and stability for the world. Governments worldwide have no choice but to cooperate in dealing with the threat of terrorism as a security issue, but halting the spread of terrorism and extremism can be achieved by addressing its social, political and cultural root causes. We must also be careful not to use the fight against terrorism as an umbrella to cover reprisals or the shelling of civilians. The fight against terrorism and extremism was and will continue to be a top priority. That is affirmed by the effective participation of the State of Qatar in regional and international efforts to implement the measures included in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted in 2006, and all the Security Council resolutions and measures related to countering terrorism and its financing. We have also participated in international coalitions and regional organizations and nurtured bilateral relations with the United States of America and many countries of the world. The State of Qatar will continue its regional and international efforts in this regard and will develop them further. While reaffirming our condemnation of all forms of extremism and terrorism, we reject the tackling of this phenomenon using double standards, according to the identity of the perpetrators, or linking terrorism with a particular religion, race, civilization, culture or society. The issues facing the Middle East continue to pose the greatest threat to international peace and security due to the vital importance of that region to the world. Israel still stands in the way of achieving a lasting, just and comprehensive peace and rejects the Arab Peace Initiative. The Israeli Government maintains its intransigent approach and strategy to create facts on the ground through expanding settlement construction in the occupied territories, Judaizing Jerusalem and restricting the performance of religious rituals in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is a serious, provocative act. It also continues to impose its blockade on the Gaza Strip. The international community must give high priority to the resumption of peace negotiations on the basis of ending the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories within a specified time frame, and to reaching a just, comprehensive and vital settlement, in accordance with the two-State solution, agreed upon by the international community and based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative. A settlement will be achieved only through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. I renew my appeal to my Palestinian brothers to achieve national reconciliation, consolidate their positions and speak with one voice when confronting the dangers and challenges facing the Palestinian question on the future of the Palestinian people. The international community is unable to find a solution to the Syrian crisis despite its consequences and serious repercussions for the region and the world. Political efforts continue to falter due to conflicting international and regional interests, which serve to protect those against whom we are supposed to stand united. The international community has relinquished its legal and moral responsibilities, including the implementation of its decisions, and has succumbed to the logic of force. What is required is serious work to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis in a way that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people to justice, dignity and freedom, and to maintain the unity and sovereignty of Syria, in accordance with the decisions of the Geneva I Conference on Syria. Qatar will spare no effort in providing support and assistance to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of our Syrian brothers and to implement our humanitarian pledges within the framework of the United Nations. The international community has given up the task of protecting civilians. Will it also hesitate to find war criminals accountable? Their impunity will have dire consequences for the situation in Syria and the region, and would affect the behaviour of future dictatorships towards their peoples in the absence of any deterrent. Turning to the Libyan question, Libyaâ??s national consensus, which would preserve its unity, sovereignty and social fabric and restore its stability, could be achieved by means of combining domestic and international efforts. We must all intensify our efforts and support the Government of National Accord, which has been established with the support of the United Nations, in its effort to restore stability and to counter terrorism and its grave consequences. The State of Qatar has supported international mediation efforts and will support them in future in order to meet the aspirations of the Libyan people. Concerning the fraternal country of Iraq, we support the efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve security, stability and the unity of the territory and people of Iraq. We commend the achievements of the Iraqi people in their fight against terrorism. We reaffirm our support to promote their victory by helping the people of Iraq to realize their aspirations for equality among all its citizens and to restore Iraqâ??s role at the regional and international levels. Concerning Yemen, we affirm the importance of maintaining Yemenâ??s unity, security and stability and ending the state of infighting and war, while adopting dialogue, a political solution and national reconciliation as a basis for ending this crisis and implementing Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). We call on the international community to facilitate the access of humanitarian assistance to various Yemeni regions. The State of Qatar supports the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen to end the crisis and realize the aspirations of the brotherly Yemeni people to attain unity, security and stability. In order to achieve security and stability in the Gulf region, we reiterate the call that we have made before from this rostrum for a constructive dialogue between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Iran on the basis of common interests, the principle of good-neighbourliness, respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. In the framework of international efforts to address humanitarian crises, the State of Qatar continues to contribute to the international response to the growing humanitarian needs of the world at large. We have increased our financial contributions to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) so as to enable the Organization to implement its programmes and provide humanitarian relief to those in need worldwide. The State of Qatar ranks third on the list of major donors to OCHA in 2017. We continue to provide support to countries facing challenges in implementing their development plans. It is worth mentioning here that the State of Qatar ranked first in the Arab world and 33rd in the world in the field of human development. This proves the effectiveness of our humanitarian and development policy. We look forward to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which we all have committed to achieve. In conclusion, we reiterate that the State of Qatar will spare no effort in strengthening the role of the United Nations and and efforts to achieve what the international community seeks, bringing peace and security and promoting human rights and advancing development. Qatar will remain, as is always the case, a safe haven for the oppressed, and we will continue its mediation efforts to find just solutions in conflict zones.",1,196
7848,Session 72 - 2017,ROU_72_2017.txt,ROU_72_2017,72,2017,ROU,"I would like to begin my statement by conveying my condolences to the people of Mexico in the wake of the 19 September earthquake. Let me welcome the theme of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Those are very important objectives that will require all of our determination as responsible leaders in order to achieve them, especially when we see obstacles before us. Indeed, people across the globe still suffer from the brutal effects of war, poverty, inequality and injustice. Tensions over cultural identity and faith are rising, even within traditionally open and tolerant societies. Natural disasters cause increasing damage every season. Terrorist attacks deepen the sense of insecurity. Even if there are some perceptions that the United Nations has not dealt well with the multitude and complexity of the new crises at hand, it is clear that no path serves us better than multilateralism in finding viable solutions for the current global challenges. More than ever, a rules-based international system â?? namely, the international rule of law â?? is vital our success. The United Nations has to be equipped with the essential tools to perform as an efficient Organization that reflects the will of its Member States and enjoys the trust of all the people of the planet. At the same time, we, the Member States, must increase our commitment to the Organization. Developing and sustaining peace require not only a swift and adequate response to crises, but also an understanding of the root causes of conflicts and insecurity, which rarely emerge from a single source. At the same time, the agenda of the United Nations is not only about conflicts and crises; it is also about sustainable development and the promotion of human rights. It is about hope and a decent life for all, which represent the only foundation on which we can build a safe and sustainable planet. Working on education and ensuring the prosperity of our peoples are the most efficient ways to prevent instability and crises. Focusing our actions on people should remain the ultimate goal. How should we achieve that goal? We have to drive the implementation of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development forward, including in relation to conflict prevention and sustaining peace, as well as with respect to its Sustainable Development Goals. Romania has formulated essential development policies that will have a real impact on advancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We have chosen to involve all political actors, civil society, the private sector and the scientific community in that process. To share our experience in coordinating the national process of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to discuss our progress, Romania will submit its voluntary national review during the meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development to be held in July 2018. We cannot lose sight of the stabilizing role that the United Nations plays in setting the broad parameters of contemporary international relations. That is why our efforts to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations should remain strong. At the end of the day, no matter what a reformed Security Council may look like in the future, we need the United Nations to have robust policy-planning capabilities and the ability to project visions for global peace and well-being beyond present crises. Romania supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s focus on the creation of an integrated institutional structure for supporting a holistic approach to crisis management. We also strongly advocate for modernizing and increasing the effectiveness of peace operations. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to pursue meaningful reform on three priorities: conflict prevention, sustainable development and management reform, including reshaping the Secretariat in order to make the United Nations more efficient. My country also welcomes the reform of the counter-terrorism architecture of the United Nations, as well as the steps taken by the United Nations to make counter-terrorism a key element of its prevention agenda. Since no country can fight such a terrible scourge alone, we trust that the newly established Office of Counter-Terrorism will increase our effectiveness in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In that respect, Romania remains committed to the common initiative, developed with Spain, for the possible future establishment of an international court against terrorism. We also expect to see the United Nations increase its contribution to global efforts in the area of international migration, including in addressing the problem of its main origins. We hope for a consistent follow-up to the New York Declaration. In my view, it is important to ensure that the global compact for migration, on which negotiations will start soon, will cover every aspect of international migration, to the benefit of both migrants and host communities. We also support the reinforcement of the human rights dimension within all relevant areas of United Nations activities. That is why I welcome the Secretary- Generalâ??s Human Rights up Front initiative, which aims to mainstream human rights policies throughout the United Nations system. Earlier today, I had the pleasure of organizing a debate on a very important topic â?? making education for peace. The use of identity fears and of the us- versus-them paradigm cannot be left unanswered. In the context of increasing violence and disinformation, Romania is convinced that it is only through quality education that we can counter the extremist trends that our young people are facing today. At the same time, we continue to be concerned about security developments in and around our region. The belt of protracted conflicts around the Black Sea remains a serious threat. We are still witnessing actions that offend the principles and norms of international law. The proliferation of protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood is an obstacle to regional cooperation and has brought our mutual confidence to a historically low level, which is why the international community should actively support and stimulate regional cooperation and confidence-building measures and decisively address conflicts. Romania has constantly emphasized the importance of strengthening United Nations cooperation with regional and subregional organizations. To that end, we promoted Security Council resolution 1631 (2005) in our capacity as a non-permanent member of the Council at the time. Romania would be proud to once again bring its contributions to the work of the Security Council. Our bid for a non-permanent seat for the 2020- 2021 term is about my countryâ??s sincere engagement in supporting the efforts of the United Nations for peace and security and our enduring commitment to peace, development and justice. If that endeavour is successful, we will be honoured to work even harder for the advancement of our common projects and of the Organization as a whole.",1,196
7849,Session 72 - 2017,RUS_72_2017.txt,RUS_72_2017,72,2017,RUS,"In December of last year, the General Assembly adopted resolution 71/190, on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, which clearly stipulated the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States and of coups dâ??Ã©tat as a method of transferring power, and the importance of excluding from international relations certain Statesâ?? efforts to exert unlawful pressure on others, including through the extraterritorial application of national jurisdictions. An overwhelming majority of Member States voted in favour of the resolution. The minority was chiefly represented by the very countries that, contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, are attempting to dominate world affairs and impose their own development models and values on other States and peoples, led by a one-sided logic that undermines international law. But the world is not standing still. We were pleased that United States President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this rostrum the day before yesterday that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs and to lead by example rather than by imposing oneâ??s will on other nations, and that countries with different values, cultures and aspirations can not only coexist but can work side by side on a basis of mutual respect. I believe that we can all subscribe to those words, especially if United States foreign policy will in fact be conducted on that basis. Russia has always abided by the principles of sovereignty, non-interference in the affairs of other States, the equality of peoples and mutual respect in its international dealings, and it will continue to uphold them. In the past quarter century, despite challenges, our country has taken on in good faith its share of the work of eliminating the legacy of the Cold War and has done much to strengthen trust and understanding in Europe, the Atlantic region and all over the world. However, that has not been reciprocated by our Western partners, intoxicated as they were by the illusion of the onset of the end of history, and who are still trying to adapt rudimentary institutions designed for an era of bloc-versus-bloc confrontation to todayâ??s realities. NATO wants to recreate the climate of the Cold War and refuses to implement the principle it solemnly declared in the 1990s â?? equal and indivisible security throughout the region of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The West has built its policies according to the principle of â??he who is not with us is against usâ??, and has proceeded with the heedless expansion of NATO eastwards, fomenting instability in post-Soviet geopolitics and inciting anti-Russian feeling. It is that policy that lies at the root of the protracted conflict in Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, the authorities in Kyiv constantly come up with new ploys to interfere with the implementation of their commitments under the package of measures outlined in the Minsk agreements of 12 February 2015 and endorsed by the Security Council. But even in those circumstances, Russia has been focused on constructive effort and on finding mutually acceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In response to concerns that have been expressed about the current security situation, President Putin has launched an initiative to establish a United Nations mission to protect the OSCE observers in the Donbas region, and a corresponding draft resolution has been introduced in the Security Council. We believe Russiaâ??s proposal will help to facilitate a settlement of the internal crisis in Ukraine that resulted from the anti-constitutional coup led by ultra-radicals. We hope for constructive interaction on the issues with our European and United States partners, without zero-sum games. Here at United Nations Headquarters, we should bear in mind how the United Nations began. The decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal were a warning against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and the disastrous consequences of attempts to take control of the worldâ??s destiny by trampling on the lawful interests of other nations and peoples. It is disgusting to use concerns about freedom of expression as a pretext for condoning radical movements that preach neo-Nazi ideology and support the glorification of Nazis and their associates. We need constant vigilance to maintain a secure shield against neo-Nazism, revanchism, extremism and xenophobia and strengthen international and intercultural harmony. Inciting hatred and intolerance, terrorists, extremists and nationalists destroy and desecrate objects of historical, religious and cultural value. Civilized Europe tolerates the demolition of monuments to the liberators of the continent and heroes of the Second World War whose victory was the foundation for the United Nations. We think this issue should be a priority for immediate attention from the General Assembly and UNESCO with a view to establishing a legal framework to prevent such actions, and Russia intends to submit proposals for it. The continuing indifference to the shameful issue of statelessness that persists in Europe is also unacceptable, as is the suppression of minority languages, which is a gross violation of Council of Europe conventions. History has shown us throughout the ages that arriving at lasting settlements to disputes is possible only through dialogue and finding a balance between the conflicting partiesâ?? core interests. Unfortunately, outright pressure is replacing diplomacy increasingly often in the arsenals of a number of Western countries. Imposing unilateral sanctions on top of those authorized by the Security Council is an illegitimate act that undermines the collective international effort. Today we have all been watching with alarm as the United States has imposed yet another set of restrictions â?? in fact, extraterritorial restrictions â?? on Iran, and threatening the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has become a key factor in international and regional stability. The United States embargo on Cuba, which has gone on for more than half a century, is a demonstration of the uselessness of policies involving unilateral sanctions, and almost every Member State has been calling for it to be lifted for decades. It is time to listen to them. The spiralling confrontation around the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea is unraveling dangerously. We firmly condemn Pyongyangâ??s adventurist nuclear- missile manoeuvres, which violate Security Council resolutions. But whipping up military hysteria is not only a blind alley, it is a deadly one. It goes without saying that all Security Council resolutions must be implemented but, along with sanctions, they all include provisions on the importance of resuming talks. We must stop blocking those provisions. There is no alternative to the political and diplomatic route, based on a dialogue among all interested parties, for addressing the Korean peninsulaâ??s nuclear problem. We urge all responsible members of the international community to support the Russian-Chinese road map, as outlined by the Foreign Ministries of Russia and China in a joint statement on 4 July. Incitement to disorder and threats of violent intervention in the cause of the democratization of Venezuela are unacceptable, as is any action aimed at undermining the legitimate Government of any country. In any internal conflict, the international community must encourage the parties to take the path of national reconciliation and compromise. Efforts to ignore the opinions of others and resort to decrees and ultimatums, or to use force to circumvent the Charter of United Nations, have never done any good. The explosion of international terrorism, the millions of refugees and unprecedented waves of illegal migration are to a large degree the result of the attempts of the past few years to achieve regime change, including through the armed interventions that have wreaked havoc and destruction in the Middle East and North Africa and have paved the way for terrorists in parts of the world where they had never appeared before. Despite the fact that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is pulling back in Syria and Iraq, considerable additional effort will be needed to stabilize the region. We should recall that we are fighting Al-Nusra as well as ISIL, despite the fact that for some reason Al-Nusra is tolerated by United States coalition members. Recent developments in Syria have given grounds for cautious optimism. The sixth international meeting on Syria, held in Astana on 14 and 15 September, finalized the establishment of the four de-escalation zones, which had been agreed on with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and the United Nations, with the support of many other countries. The agreements create the conditions for further progress towards implementing Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) on the basis of direct dialogue between the Government and the opposition aimed at uniting their efforts to eliminate the terrorist epicentre as soon as possible and restoring peace and unity throughout the country, while resolving its acute humanitarian problems. The most urgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian aid and demining the liberated territories. We believe firmly that anyone who sincerely desires peace for Syria and its people should take part in this process under the leadership of the United Nations and without any preconditions. The incidents where chemical weapons have been used in the region are a separate issue. Every case should be investigated honestly and professionally, with no attempts to manipulate the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism. Finding solutions to humanitarian issues and reconciling conflicting parties are also relevant issues for other crises in the region, including the situations in Libya, Yemen and Iraq. In all of those situations, as with any conflict, Russia is pursuing a balanced policy and working with all parties without exception. With regard to issues in the Middle East and North Africa, we cannot put United Nations decisions on the Palestinian question and the Arab Peace Initiative on the backburner, much less consign them to oblivion. We believe that restoring Palestinian unity is crucial and welcome Egyptâ??s efforts in that direction. Russia is ready to assist in every possible way with the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, and to cooperate with its partners in the Quartet and the Arab League of States for that purpose. As long as the Palestinian question goes unresolved, it will continue to be exploited by extremists, who are attracting ever more new recruits. The never-ending bloody terrorist attacks around the world illustrate the illusory nature of efforts to create isolated safe havens. We can combat extremism and terrorism together, without double standards or hidden agendas, only based on the primary responsibility of States, as envisaged in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We welcome the reform of United Nations counter-terrorism activities that the Secretary-General has initiated, which the General Assembly has endorsed. We see the appointment of a Russian to head the new United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism as an acknowledgement of the role that Russia has played in combating this evil, and we thank everyone for their support. Russia is committed to the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. Under the existing treaty regimes in the area of arms control and non-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons should be the end result of a process of universal and total disarmament that continues to ensure equal and indivisible security. Attempts to outlaw nuclear weapons that ignore current realities and all the factors that can affect strategic stability serve only to make this common goal further off than ever and to undermine the consensus regimes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We urge everyone to say no to the militarization of the information space. We must work to stop it becoming an arena for political and military confrontation and prevent the use of information and communications technologies as instruments for exerting pressure, inflicting economic damage and spreading terrorist and extremist propaganda. The United Nations should focus its efforts on formulating rules for responsible behaviour in the digital sphere that can meet the security interests of all States. Russia has drafted a universal convention on countering cybercrime, including hacking, and we hope to launch discussions on it during the current session. It is clear that in future the world will continue to confront a whole range of new, long-term problems affecting our entire civilization. We have no right to waste our energy, time and efforts on geopolitical games. We need collective approaches, not unilateral ones. The process of shaping a polycentric world order is also a trend â?? a changing event that reflects the redistribution of the global balance of power and the increasing role that the cultural and civilizational identity of peoples plays in it. All of us, including those who are used to telling the world what to do, will have to adapt to it. It is in our common interests not to try to restrain this natural process. We will have to work to ensure that the world order becomes fair and democratic, 26/33 17-29585 just as the founding fathers of the United Nations envisioned. Globalization should unite rather than divide people, while taking account of the interests of all States without exception and contributing to a stable and secure future for all humankind. Without mutual trust, we cannot hope for the effective implementation of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, or for solutions to global issues that are so crucial to developing countries, such as food security, demographics and health care. The fundamental principles of international relations should include the recognition of political pluralism, freedom of choice and the rule of law. We must stop relying on military alliances and instead provide support and security guarantees to States that opt for neutrality. On the economic front, we must work to lower barriers to trade and investment and stop politicizing economic relations. The International Olympic Movement, and sports in general, should remain outside politics. First and foremost, we must foster in young people respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of todayâ??s world. We invite everybody to the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students, which my country will host in Sochi less than a month from now. Another important event will take place in Russia at the same time, when St. Petersburg convenes the 137th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly, at which the main topic for discussion will be â??Promoting cultural pluralism and peace through interfaith and inter-ethnic dialogueâ??. Let us encourage dialogue among various cultures and religions and stop using historical events to foment hatred and fear. A philosophy of coexistence, unity and harmonization of countriesâ?? different interests underlies President Vladimir Putinâ??s proposal for a greater Eurasian partnership, open to all States of Asia and Europe, with the goal of creating an economic and humanitarian space based on the principle of the indivisibility of security. It goes without saying that equal rights for all, individuals and States, would be a universal requirement, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations. Those just and equitable principles form the foundation for the activities of various organizations in which Russia actively participates, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. We also continue to build relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and other associations of Asian, African and Latin American countries. Through our joint efforts we have achieved a more balanced approach in the work of organizations such as the Group of 20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We believe in the vitality of this Organization and would like the Secretary-General to play an active role in facilitating the full realization of its potential based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while respecting the prerogatives of its intergovernmental bodies. Peacekeeping reform in particular requires a carefully tailored approach, without abrupt shifts or abandoning decades of invaluable accumulated experience. Two thousand years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, â??We are born to live togetherâ??. The founding fathers of the United Nations understood that better than anyone. They believed â?? and enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations â?? that our God-given existence on a single planet should compel all of us to unite in order to prevent the scourge of new wars. If we are to do that today, we badly need to revive the culture of diplomacy and dialogue and the quest for a balance of our interests, rather than making rash, instinctive decisions in our desire to punish those who disobey us. What this is really about is preserving humankind in all its richness and diversity. Russia has always been, and always will be, open to working together with all those who show that they are ready to meet halfway and cooperate on a basis of equality and mutual respect. We will continue to uphold those principles in the work of the United Nations in the interests of improving global governance and genuinely democratizating international relations.",1,196
7850,Session 72 - 2017,RWA_72_2017.txt,RWA_72_2017,72,2017,RWA,"Every year, the United Nations channels billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance. It also sets the global agenda on key policy issues from development to womenâ??s rights, while providing a platform for major international agreements. Those are signs of an Organization that is both relevant and, in many cases, effective. And yet there is a sense that the United Nations is not meeting our needs and expectations. In that context, I would like to commend the Secretary-General, and to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, on the two important initiatives that the Secretary-General championed this week â?? his initiative on United Nations reform and his response to sexual exploitation and abuse. Those steps go to the heart of the matter, which is the deficit of trust and accountability in the international system. To be truly effective in delivering a decent life for all, the United Nations must treat all the people it serves with impartiality and respect, and it must be a good steward of the funds entrusted to it. Abuse and waste are therefore not a mere public-relations problem but an existential challenge that must be tackled head- on. The Secretary-General deserves our full support in his efforts to make the United Nations not only effective but transformational. We have the tools and the mandates to address the global challenges of our day, from climate change to peacebuilding to human equality and development. Where we fall short is in getting things done. Institutional reform is not a one-off event like applying a fresh coat of paint. The essence of reform is a mindset of constantly striving to improve performance and delivery and holding ourselves responsible for shortcomings and results. In that sense, the reform spirit that has started to take root in both the United Nations and the African Union is encouraging, and Rwanda is happy to be associated with both. This positive momentum is also positioning the United Nations and the African Union to work more closely together. Concrete steps can be taken on both sides to improve the quality of coordination and consultation. The African Union and the United Nations are already good partners in peacekeeping, and Rwanda is happy and proud to have forces serving under both flags. But we can do much more and do it better. We also share the common objective of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and Africaâ??s Agenda 2063 targets, and of continuing to enhance womenâ??s empowerment. Closer collaboration will help us bridge the growing digital divide through universal broadband access, which can connect our people to networks of knowledge and prosperity. Canada and Rwanda, together with other stakeholders, are working to raise awareness of the tremendous impact we can have right away by ratifying and implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. This is among the most important actions that a country can take in directly tackling climate change and reaffirming its commitment to the Paris Agreement. Fewer than 15 additional ratifications are needed in order for the Kigali Amendment to come into force in 2019. Our world is facing difficult challenges, but no more than in the past. Working together in a constructive spirit, we can ensure for our children the future they deserve.",1,196
7851,Session 72 - 2017,SAU_72_2017.txt,SAU_72_2017,72,2017,SAU,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to wish him every success. I would also like to thank Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session, for his efforts throughout his tenure. I am very pleased to be addressing the Assembly today as my country celebrates its national holiday. We look to the past with pride and are working ambitiously towards the future. Today, I am the messenger of a State that has made its people its top priority and resolutely set forth on a path to sustainable development through creating opportunities, thanks to its fruitful partnerships with friends around the world. Under the leadership of our King, we are helping to establish peace and security in the region and around the world. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most protracted dispute in the modern history of our region and has led to innumerable tragedies and endless human suffering. Nothing can justify its continuation, especially when there is an international consensus on the importance of reaching a two-State solution, based on internationally recognized resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, with the goal of establishing an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the pre-1967 borders. More than ever we need concerted international determination to make that solution a reality. We have been tackling the Houthi-Saleh insurgency in Yemen as a coalition in order to help the legitimate Government of Yemen save its people and restore its State in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. That was not a choice for us in Yemen. We resorted to it only after sustained political efforts to maintain Yemenâ??s safety and stability and preserve its territorial integrity and independence. We therefore affirm our full support for the political process in Yemen and will stand by the United Nations and its Special Envoy in their efforts to arrive at a political solution in line with Security Council resolution 2216 (2015) and the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, and through national dialogue. We are aware of the extent of the humanitarian suffering of our brothers in Yemen since the coup dâ??Ã©tat and have spared no effort to come to their aid. In fact, the assistance provided by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in recent years now amounts to more than $8 billion for every area of humanitarian medical and development needs, funnelled through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre. My country firmly condemns and is gravely concerned about the Government of Myanmarâ??s policy of repression and forced displacement of the Rohingya minority, which runs counter to all respect for humanitarian values and international law. It is a human tragedy that demands an urgent response and should end immediately, in line with the principles on which our Organization was founded. As we urge the Government of Myanmar to honour its obligations and protect its peoples from discrimination, we continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya. King Salman has provided $15 million to help the displaced, in addition to my countryâ??s provision of assistance by taking in more than half a million Rohingya refugees. His Majesty has also personally intervened with neighbouring States and has been working with the Government of Bangladesh to ensure safe passage for the refugees and decent living conditions for them in the various host countries. Today our international community is facing one of the greatest ever challenges to its security and stability, the threat of terrorism, which is striking all over the world, in defiance of all human rights and values. My country will continue to work steadfastly to counter extremism and terrorism in all their manifestations. The Arab-Islamic-American summit was held in Riyadh in May with that purpose and affirmed unequivocally the importance of pursuing joint efforts to end extremism and terrorism by cutting off their sources of financing. As it happens, the crisis in Qatar is interfering with our policies designed to combat terrorism and extremism and cut off their financing. Meanwhile, the Syrian crisis is entering its sixth year, and the conflict has already claimed hundreds of thousands of victims. From the beginning, my country has opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of Syrians. In general, the Middle East is going through a period of unprecedented tensions and continuing crises, in which Iran has played a part. Turning to the crisis in Qatar, we have continued with a firm policy aimed at combating the fostering of extremism and terrorism through Dohaâ??s provision of financial support to terrorism, as well as helping it to disseminate violent hate speech. Qatar has also been providing a safe haven for those who have violated the law and must be brought to justice, thereby helping to spread chaos and foment dissension. Our group of four States has demanded firmly that Qatar adhere to the principles of international law where the fight against terrorism is concerned, including by honouring its obligations under the 2013 Riyadh Agreement and its complementary agreement of 2014, which are all legitimate demands. In its desire to affirm the principles of the Charter of the United Nations regarding the safeguarding of the peace and security of peoples around the world, my country was one of the first to call for establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We have also demonstrated the importance we attach to the Sustainable Development Goals and their three economic, social and environmental pillars through our Vision 2030, aimed at enabling our country to achieve sustainable, people-centred development in order to build a more robust economy. And we have always striven to provide support to developing countries by providing official development assistance totalling 0.7 per cent of our gross national income. In conclusion, I would like to thank those who are helping people everywhere, wherever they are, and who are working for peace.",1,196
7852,Session 72 - 2017,SDN_72_2017.txt,SDN_72_2017,72,2017,SDN,"It is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to wish us all success at this yearâ??s General Assembly session. I express my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its current session, His Excellency Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, and wish him success in his endeavours. In addition, I would like to express my appreciation of the wisdom and efficiency of his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, who steered the work of the seventy-first session. The theme of the seventy-second session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? reflects the importance the United Nations attaches to the implementation of its pillars: peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights. It also proves that the United Nations is committed to anchoring the concept of peace, prosperity and good livelihood for everyone. Those are the hopes and ambitions that we all that seek in order to achieve sustainable development, fight poverty in all this forms and achieve prosperity for future generations. The Sudan looks forward to playing an effective role in the United Nations, alognside the rest of the international community, in order to achieve the necessary reform, respond to Africaâ??s needs regarding reform of the security Council, promote the development role of the United Nations, implement the internationally agreed Agenda for Sustainable Development and fight against the politicization of justice. As part of the national dialogue initiative led by our President, Mr. Omar Hassan Al-Bashir, in 2014 a Government of National Unity was established with the broad participation of various political components and previously armed groups to promote peace and security in the country. The implementation of the exit strategy for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2363 (2017), proves that the Sudan has turned the page on conflict and has embarked on a new era of peace and stability. We would like to express our thanks and appreciation for the support of the United Nations, the African Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and brotherly and friendly countries. We hope to receive the support of peace and development funds, especially the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, as well as from the World Bank and its mechanisms, so that we can implement the Governmentâ??s approach, which promotes peace and implements the outcomes of the national dialogue. That approach will also urge the remaining armed groups to join the quest for peace. That is why our President adopted resolution 479 on 1 July, expanding the ceasefire everywhere until the end of October, even though some of those rebel groups pursue their irresponsible practices, destabilizing Darfur as they carry out desperate military actions in May. Attempted attacks by those groups in Libya and the Republic of South Sudan were futile and failed. We express our deep concern vis-Ã -vis the lack of strict action by relevant United Nations entities and the international community against the rebel groups that have been working as mercenaries in Libya and South Sudan. That only tempts them to refuse any engagement in the peace process and comes at the time when the Government of the Sudan is waiting for those groups to implement the peace road map agreement sponsored by the African Union and supported by the international community. With regard to the cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the United Nations and the Security Council, we have welcomed the Panel of Experts of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) three times in the past. The Panel visited all states of Darfur, and its reports commended the cooperation of my Government and emphasized that Darfur has recovered stability and security. That is why we stress the importance of adopting the recommendation of the Committee Chair to review the sanctions of resolution 1591 (2005), so as to support peace in Darfur and the region. The Sudan has always defended the principles of justice and international cooperation. We have sought to implement them, especially the principle of fighting impunity. However, the politicization of international justice, as is the case with the International Criminal Court, has jeopardized its political weight. It has disappointed the international community, especially the African community, which had great hopes that that Criminal Court would anchor the principles of international criminal justice. Sudanâ??s position vis-Ã -vis the Court, which is expressed in the position of the African Union in its summit decisions, stresses that the International Criminal Court is an organ that manipulates the law for political objectives to be imposed against the will of people, especially African people. The Court, therefore, cannot serve the purpose of justice. For that reason the Sudan calls for heeding the African voice. We call upon the States of the world to anchor the principles of justice without allowing international justice to become a political tool used by some. We also warn against the use of the United Nations in the name of international justice, on the basis of the cooperation agreement between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, in a way that tarnishes the reputation of the United Nations and involves it in international political conflicts. We will continue to fight any attempt to involve the Court in the United Nations system, and we call upon all lovers of justice in the world to follow suit. My Government has spared no effort to fight human trafficking, illicit migration, electronic crime and drug trafficking to ensure sustainable comfort and stability at the international, regional and national levels. That comes from the fact that the Sudan enjoys a geographic position in the middle of the African continent, linking it to the rest of the continent and to the Middle East. Those efforts include effective and active involvement in the European Union-Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative â?? the Khartoum Process â?? to address the causes and repercussions of illicit migration in the Horn of Africa, in addition to other cooperation frameworks. As for refugees, the Sudan hosts some 3 million from neighbouring countries, and other countries as well. We have provided great assistance to those refugees, meeting more than 80 per cent of their needs at a time when the international community meets only 20 per cent of that need. We do that even though half of the refugees live outside of camps, which places pressure on the services we provide to our citizens because of difficult economic circumstances. I would like to note the recent visit of Mr. Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to the Sudan in mid-August, where he met the President of the Republic and many other officials, including myself. He addressed the situation of the refugees in the Sudan and expressed great appreciation for the role the Sudan has been playing on behalf of the international community in providing care for the refugees. He also commended the Sudan for opening its borders at a time when other countries are closing theirs. He called upon the international community to provide further support to the Sudan as it shoulders its responsibility vis-Ã -vis refugees, and he called for supporting host countries and State institutions caring for the refugees. That is something the Sudan values, and we look forward to hearing the deliberations in the General Assembly around that issue. The Sudan has received a daily influx of refugees, especially from South Sudan, almost 2,000 persons a day at some checkpoints. In connection with the special relations between the Sudan and South Sudan and the shared connections between the two peoples and countries, my delegation stresses its full commitment to efforts with international and regional partners, especially the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union, to achieve peace and stability in South Sudan. We will also continue our great efforts to address the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in South Sudan. My delegation renews its commitment to the full implementation of the agreements signed with South Sudan on 27 September 2012 and all agreements signed between the two countries to build a bright future for the two brotherly peoples. The Sudan stresses our principled position to fight the use of terrorism in all its forms, including violent extremism, as a means to achieve political objectives. We are committed to all international and regional agreements and conventions that we have ratified, and we have always been an active party at the international, regional and bilateral levels. The contributions of the Sudan have had a great positive impact in fighting that phenomenon and preventing further terrorist attacks through information-sharing and the good relations our institutions have with our international and regional counterparts. At the national level, in March 2016 we announced our first special field study on the causes of terrorism and the means of fighting it in the Sudan, in cooperation with the United Nations. The study was commended by the many countries that attended and took part in the announcement of the study. We continue our efforts in cooperation with the relevant United Nations organs to ensure that the Sudanese strategy is coherent with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Sudan was able to fulfil all of its technical commitments in order to obtain foreign debt forgiveness after the separation of South Sudan, through the work of the Tripartite Committee for the Joint Approach to the International Community on Economic Relief, composed of the Sudan, South Sudan and the high- level African mechanism, on the basis of the zero option on apportionment debt, which was extended recently until October 2018. We have also adopted a road map to engage with debtors and the international community after fulfilling all technical conditions to obtain forgiveness in line with the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. However, that has yet to be achieved. Foreign debt is a great hurdle and a genuine burden for heavily indebted poor countries, thwarting their stability and sustainable development. Debt affects and negatively impacts their relations with the international and regional financing institutions and foreign investments. Therefore we stress the need for forgiveness in line with the Initiative. The Sudan has been making great efforts to provide fresh drinking water through the Presidentâ??s Zero Thirst programme. We believe in the importance of water. Therefore, we have made great efforts and taken many initiatives to promote cooperation among the Nile basin countries. We hope that those efforts succeed in achieving sustainable development. To stress the pioneering role of the Sudan in addressing issues of regional development and the environment, in the upcoming months we will host the African Great Green Wall Summit. The Great Green Wall is one of the greatest regional environmental cooperation projects. It stretches from Dakar in the west to Djibouti in the east, to achieve environmental balance in the African desert and to reduce the impact of climate change. Africa will be the main victim of climate change if this is not averted. The Sudan stresses its firm position with regard to preserving the nuclear non-proliferation regime and destroying all weapons of mass destruction. That is the only guarantee to prevent the use of those weapons and the only way to anchor peace, stability and security in the world. In that connection, we renew our full commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We call upon all countries that have not yet signed the Treaty to do so without any delay. We renew our firm position with respect to the Palestinian question. We condemn all forms of aggression against religious shrines in Palestine, especially against the holy Al-Haram Al-Sharif. The only way forward towards peace in the Middle East is through the implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy and the two-State solution, returning to the borders of 4 June 1967, in line with the Arab Peace Initiative. We renew our firm position in support of constitutional legitimacy in Yemen. We call upon all political stakeholders to engage in the political process, reject fighting and violence and return to legitimacy. My delegation stresses the need to preserve territorial integrity in Syria. We support all efforts to overcome the crisis in that country and highlight the importance of a political solution and the need to respect the will of this great people. Once again, we emphasize the need to ensure stability in brotherly Somalia. We call for the provision of all forms of support to the Government and the people of that country so as to enable them to overcome their challenges and build legitimate institutions. With regard to the situation in Libya, our position has never changed. We continue to work with the international community to ensure the success of all initiatives for security and stability, especially the Skhirat Agreement, which is the cornerstone of a political solution in brotherly Libya. We stress our full respect for the security, freedom and integrity of Libya as well as the prosperity of its people. My delegation stresses the importance of achieving stability and sustainable development on the African continent and addressing the economic and security challenges that thwart its development, particularly the situations in the Lake Chad Basin, the Great Lakes region and Mali. In this regard, we call upon the international community to support regional initiatives to overcome these challenges, such as the Force conjointe du G5 Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin region initiatives. We also call for the promotion of the strategic partnership between the United Nations and the African Union in order to achieve peace and stability and implement the Sustainable Development Goals. In conclusion, we renew our commitment to multilateralism under the leadership of the United Nations with a view to promoting the two most noble of purposes under the Charter of the United Nations: maintaining international peace and security and promoting the prosperity of all people. We stand in full solidarity with the Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and support his reform agenda.",1,196
7853,Session 72 - 2017,SEN_72_2017.txt,SEN_72_2017,72,2017,SEN,"The Senegalese delegation would like to thank the President of the General Assembly at its previous session and to wish the current President every success in guiding the work of our session. I would also like to reiterate our congratulations and support to Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for the success of his mission at the head of the Organization. The theme of the seventy-second session commits us to focusing on people for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. Unfortunately, in these times of turbulence and uncertainty, the ideal of a better world for all comes up against the crises of a world of conflict that is also in conflict with itself. On the security and humanitarian fronts, millions of individuals continue to suffer every day from the ravages of war, terrorism and violence in all their forms. With regard to food crises, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, more than 1 billion tons of food are wasted each year, while more than 795 million people go hungry every day. Where the environment is concerned, global warming has reached an unprecedented level, while agreed-on commitments to addressing the related crises, including adequate Green Climate Fund financing, have been slow to materialize. With regard to our ethical and moral crises, we see the universal mission of democracy and human rights proclaimed at the same time that it turns in on itself and lets extremist, racist and xenophobic tendencies re-emerge. These dangerous excesses, born out of the absurd claim that one race, civilization or culture is superior to others, have inspired the worst tragedies of history, including slavery, colonization, the Holocaust and apartheid. If we yield to these abuses, we renounce the founding values of the United Nations. We forget that the true challenges of our time lie elsewhere, such as in the fight against the threat of terrorism. Senegal, I emphasize, vigorously condemns terrorism wherever it may strike. Nothing, and certainly not religion, can justify violent fanaticism. At the same time, we cannot accept the equation of Islam with violence. We cannot accept that Muslims are held accountable for violence of which they themselves are victims. We are all concerned about the terrorist threat. We therefore have a responsibility to work together to find agreed solutions to this scourge. That is the purpose of the Dakar International Forum on Peace and Security in Africa, whose fourth meeting will be held on 13 and 14 November. Among other topics, the Forum will focus on the doctrinal response of Islam vis-Ã -vis violent extremism. We wish to see an Africa of peace and security, a place that does not serve as a haven for terrorist groups that are fought and defeated elsewhere. That is why Senegal remains engaged in seven peacekeeping operations, including the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, and welcomes the efforts of the Group of Five for the Sahel and its partner States in the fight against terrorism. I would like to reiterate our support for the national peace and reconciliation process under way in our sister Republic of Mali, a process that is taking place with respect for the countryâ??s territorial integrity and in accordance with Security Council resolution 2374 (2017). In the Middle East, Senegal reiterates the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders. In Burma, we are seriously concerned about the abuses of the Muslim Rohingya population. We therefore cannot allow outrage to be a selective emotion, and Senegal urges the international community to take action to put an end to this genuine human tragedy. In a world of interaction and interdependence, peace today, more so than in the past, is not merely the absence of war. It is also the preservation of the planetâ??s resources, the scarcity of which increases the risk of internal crises and of international conflicts. It is vital to safeguard the integrity of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The future of the planet is at stake. Peace also requires fairer international trade that paves the way for progress and prosperity for all. The world cannot be at peace with itself as long as there endures a system of unequal exchanges in which the haves continue to earn more and the have-nots to have even less. We must work for mutually beneficial exchanges that protect investment, pay fairly for raw materials and generate shared prosperity. That is the best way to overcome poverty, to support Africaâ??s efforts to emerge and to curb illegal migratory movements. As the current Chair of the New Partnership for Africaâ??s Development, I welcome the Compact with Africa initiative, launched by Germany within the framework of the Group of 20, to stimulate investment on the African continent. As part of this new momentum of support for development through partnership, Senegal looks forward to hosting three major events on the international communityâ??s agenda. They are the third Africa Investment Forum, from 25 to 27 September, in cooperation with China and the World Bank; the International Conference on Quality Infrastructure in January 2018, at the initiative of Japan; and, on 8 February 2018, the replenishment conference for the Global Partnership for Education Fund, amounting to $3.1 billion over three years. By mobilizing these resources, we will give millions of children the opportunity to go to school and achieve their dreams of a fulfilled life. I thank France for sponsoring the conference, together with Senegal, and we invite all partner and beneficiary States to attend. The President took the Chair. The positive changes we seek to promote in the worldâ??s affairs will succeed only in the context of an inclusive and equitable momentum that reconciles all of our interests. To that end, the time has come to afford Africa the place it deserves on the Security Council, as called for in the Ezulwini Consensus. It is time to reform the rules of global economic and financial governance, including by combating tax evasion more effectively to help mobilize domestic resources for development financing. It is time to stop seeing Africa as a continent of the future, content with random and uncertain promises that others design, write and interpret on its behalf. Africa wishes to be a stakeholder in a present that takes its interests and its need to emerge into account through renewed and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is in that spirit that Senegal will continue to work with all friendly countries and partners after its mandate on the Security Council ends, in a few monthsâ?? time. Despite the uncertainties and difficulties of our times, we must continue to have faith in multilateralism. Preceding generations had the wisdom to understand that isolationism and belligerency are a dead end. Out of the ruins of war, they built the foundations of peace; but it is a peace that is always a work in progress. Whenever its foundations falter, all humankind is threatened. The wisdom of our predecessors demands that we work together to safeguard peace, in the name of our shared humanity, which brings us together and assigns us a shared destiny.",1,196
7854,Session 72 - 2017,SGP_72_2017.txt,SGP_72_2017,72,2017,SGP,"I am honoured to speak here on behalf of one of the worldâ??s smallest city States, the Republic of Singapore. First, I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajcÃ¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji on his successful leadership as President at the seventy-first session. We are meeting at a time of great uncertainty. The old fault lines of race, language and religion remain active. There is renewed anxiety about jobs and inequality. New technologies and non-State actors are challenging the international order. Terrorist groups are using the Internet to spread their poisonous, radical ideologies, including in South-East Asia. Cyberattacks and fake news have proliferated. Conflicts in many regions of the world remain and new ones have emerged. In North-East Asia, the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s reckless actions are raising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Singapore strongly condemns the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s missile and nuclear-weapon tests, which are in flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions. We call on the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to avoid further provocations and to fully implement all of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. In Myanmarâ??s Rakhine state, a humanitarian disaster has occurred in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on 25 August and related acts of violence. It is a complex, intercommunal issue with deep historical roots, and it will not be solved instantly. It is the responsibility of every Government to protect every civilian, regardless of ethnicity, religious beliefs or origin. I visited Nay Pyi Taw last week and had a very frank discussion with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She is deeply troubled by what is happening in her own country and deeply distressed by the pain and suffering there. Extremists everywhere actually have a common playbook. First, they commit an egregious act of violence. Secondly, they stick a religious label on the situation in order to convey a sense of â??us versus themâ??. Thirdly, they eliminate the grey zone of moderates by causing alienation due to overreaction. And so, we must be very careful that we do not fall into the trap of those extremists. As a doctor, I believe that the first rule of medicine is to do no harm. Therefore, as the rest of the world looks on with distress and alarm, we need to be very careful and measured in our response. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers will be meeting later today. ASEAN supports Myanmar in seeking a long- term solution to restore stability within its own borders. Singapore will work through ASEAN and with Myanmar to extend humanitarian assistance to all affected communities. Every country actually seeks to achieve the same thing â?? to ensure the security and prosperity of our people and to create a better future for our children. But no country, no matter how wealthy, big or powerful, can achieve that alone. Multilateralism, international law, constructive interdependence and a sense of win-win cooperation are crucial to the sustainable development and prosperity for all countries. Therefore, a strong multilateral system reinforces the resilience of individual countries. This is particularly true for small States because we depend on a rules-based multilateral system for our survival and our success. Today, I want to speak, first, on the importance of multilateralism; secondly, on having an open global architecture; and thirdly, on having inclusive economic growth. My first point is on a universal, rules-based multilateral system and why it is essential if we are to solve the complex problems facing the world today. No nation can solve transboundary problems alone. We need to work with each other, we need to build consensus and we need to find effective solutions to global problems. The United Nations plays a critical role in that regard as a platform for cooperation, based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual benefit and international law. In fact, the United Nations is the universal body best placed to address the problems of the global commons. A good example is the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982, which is an enduring testament to what collective political will can achieve. Today, UNCLOS has become a constitution that governs the use of the oceans. The recent adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development showed that multilateralism can respond to new challenges, especially when there is political will and collective commitment. When dealing with global issues such as climate change, there is no alternative to a multilateral approach. The United Nations must also deal with emerging global challenges, such as cybersecurity, counter-terrorism and the economic disruption caused by the emergence of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and the potential for genetic engineering. If the United Nations is to remain effective and relevant, it must also become fit for purpose. There is much scope to optimize synergies and minimize inefficiencies within the United Nations system. In this regard, Singapore strongly supports the Secretary- Generalâ??s efforts to reform and restructure the United Nations. We welcome his management reforms and his efforts to review the United Nations development system so as to streamline the peace and security architecture. As a small State, Singapore has always been a strong supporter of an effective United Nations. This year, we are proud that the Forum of Small States, founded by Singapore in 1992, celebrates its twenty- fifth anniversary. Singapore is committed to working closely with all States, especially small States, to support the work of the United Nations and to enhance its effectiveness. Regional organizations are also an important part of an effective multilateral, rules- based system. They help to reinforce the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to underpin international law at the regional and local levels. Equally important, they help to build confidence and encourage habits of cooperation. In South-East Asia, ASEAN is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. ASEAN has not only fostered regional economic integration, but perhaps even more important, it has secured regional peace for five decades and strengthened the national resilience of each of its members by creating a sense of common identity in the midst of great diversity. The prospects for ASEAN are very bright, and we have ambitious plans to do more, under our vision of a united, resilient and innovative ASEAN. My second and related point concerns the need for an open global architecture that is essential for growth and sustainable development. We have to make a choice. One model is a world divided by rival blocs, running mercantilist economies, waging proxy wars and engaging in zero-sum competition. There is another model â?? one where there is a vision of a world with open, interdependent, sovereign States characterized by enlightened long-term national interests, win-win collaboration and sustainable development. It should come as no surprise that Singapore, almost by definition, has to support the latter model. We believe that an open, rules-based, multilateral system allows every country to fulfil its potential and its duty to its citizens. In particular, it allows small States, which are dependent on international trade and investments, to create a pathway for growth and resilience. It is therefore important, especially at this time, to remain steadfast in the face of growing cause for rising protectionism. An open trading environment has allowed developing countries to export their goods and services and raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty into a new, rising middle class. Equally important, this rise of a prosperous middle class across Asia, Africa and South America has also been associated with peace and stability. The World Trade Organization is indispensable, as it underpins the rules-based multilateral trading system and provides a framework for resolving trade disputes. The Group of Twenty (G-20) is another important platform for discussing global macroeconomic and financial issues. However, it is important for the G-20 to work closely with the United Nations and with non-members of the G-20 in order to strengthen the multilateral system and to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We welcome the efforts of successive G-20 Presidents to reach out to non-members, in particular members of the Global Governance Group. The Group will continue to be an advocate for a more accountable and inclusive framework of global governance. My third and final point is on the need for inclusive economic growth. Politically, the consensus for multilateralism and an open global architecture will not be sustained if people within our own States feel that they are going to be left behind. In other words, we need to make sure that there is inclusive economic growth that lifts all communities together. Indeed, the 2030 Agenda is fundamentally a vision for achieving long-term inclusive economic growth, not just at the national level, but at the regional and global levels as well. It is a vision shared by all countries. However, the challenge for every Government is to generate higher growth and to create more jobs while ensuring that no one is left behind. In Singapore, quite frankly, we believe firmly in the role of hard work, savings and self-reliance. However, we also believe in taking care of the weak and vulnerable in every segment of our society. Consequently, our policies on women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities are designed to protect and uplift the most vulnerable. We place great emphasis on racial and religious harmony and in building social cohesiveness. Beyond resilience, successful societies have to embrace new technologies and encourage innovation. The digital revolution is fundamentally changing the way we live, work, play, communicate, mobilize and organize our societies. We cannot wish away those disruptive changes. Instead, we have to restructure our economies and our societies, so that we can create new, better jobs for our people in this new digital world. However, that will not be an easy task; it does not come about because of a speech or two. The transformation caused by the digital revolution will be positive only if we can find ways to share the benefits more widely and to reduce inequality. It is worth remembering that at the beginning of every industrial or technological revolution there is often a period of widening inequality, because the people or the countries who experience it first have an enormous advantage. It takes time for new tools and technologies to be democratized and commoditized so that a new middle class arises, bringing in a new golden age. We need to do the same with this new revolution. That is why we in Singapore have invested heavily in education and skills, training our people, both young and old, to give everyone a chance to maximize opportunities and to harvest new potential from this new digital revolution. We want every Singaporean to have a stake in our growth and to share in our success as a nation. Let me conclude by saying that the United Nations is absolutely essential, particulary for small States such as Singapore. The United Nations has been a catalyst for peace and development for more than 70 years. It has given a young State like Singapore, just 52 years old, enormous opportunities for amazing progress over the past five decades. It has made a real difference to the lives of people around the world. In an environment of increased uncertainties, the case for multilateralism becomes stronger, not weaker. Now more than ever, we need the United Nations to help us find solutions to difficult, complex problems, global and local. We need to safeguard and strengthen our multilateral, rules-based system so that even the smallest State can survive and thrive as an independent, sovereign nation. We need an open global architecture based on a vision of an interdependent world in order to secure, sustainable prosperity for every single one of us. But most important, we need inclusive and fair economic growth to empower all our people to lead good and meaningful lives.",1,196
7855,Session 72 - 2017,SLB_72_2017.txt,SLB_72_2017,72,2017,SLB,"I would like to add to those of others the congratulations of my delegation to Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. His great experience and wisdom as a diplomat will guide our work going forward in this session. I assure him that for its part, my delegation will try to lighten his burden by providing him with full cooperation throughout the proceedings of the Assembly. With regard to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, what can I say? Not only was he the first Fijian to hold the office of President of the General Assembly, he was also the first Pacific islander to assume that prestigious office. Among his many achievements was his championing of the 1,350 voluntary commitments made at the Ocean Conference held here in June. I thank him for a marvellous job done. Our world is going through difficult times. The year 2017 has been dominated by intentional provocations and natural disasters. As such, the choice of our theme â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? is not only appropriate, it is perfectly timed. On that note, on behalf of the people of Solomon Islands, I extend our heartfelt sympathies to those affected by the recent natural disasters, in particular Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. We would like to express our sympathies to the families who lost loved ones in the recent earthquakes in Mexico. Whether we are talking about tsunamis, cyclones, flooding or earthquakes, Solomon Islands knows well the pain of having to live through such ordeals. Our hearts and prayers are with the victims. I believe that the theme can effectively be summed up in three simple yet powerful words â?? peace, humanity and equality. However, I am afraid that the status quo in the world today does not reflect them. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, approximately 65.6 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced at the end of last year. Those statistics are the result of persecution, conflict, violence or human rights violations â?? the consequences of human actions. Sadly, the majority of the displaced are women and children. They are the most vulnerable to the evil designs of their fellow human beings. They must therefore be protected. The protection of people is in the DNA of the Organization. My Government therefore reaffirms its support for the responsibility to protect. The international community must continue to stand firm in its fight to prevent crimes against humanity. I stand here with pride in saying that today we in the Pacific continue to enjoy the worldâ??s most peaceful corner. Although we play a minor role in the geopolitics of the world, we are now once again caught up in the midst of a global power play. History shows that global events have often dictated those in the Pacific region. They were events beyond our control that were imposed on us. They have had lasting effects on our peoples, many of them negative. From bygone world wars to nuclear tests, to the current instances of military provocation, we continue to deal with the remnants of those foreign-imposed events. For us in Solomon Islands, it was only a month ago that we celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of Guadalcanal, a significant battle of the Second World War. For many, that war ended in 1945, but for us its repercussions continue. Between 2011 and 2017, approximately 37,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance, weighing some 152,000 metric tons, were destroyed. I thank the Governments of Australia and the United States of America for their assistance in that exercise, which continues today. Today, we are also continually threatened by global power posturing attempting once again to dictate our fate as a region. However, we refuse to remain silent. It is on that note that I would like to register our strongest condemnation of the actions by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. We too would like to echo the global call to the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to abide by the relevant Security Council resolutions. The recent testing of ballistic missiles by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea over the Pacific Ocean is an insult to the people of the Pacific. We are ocean people. The sea is our sanctuary. It is the foundation of our heritage and where our people source their food and income. We therefore denounce any pollution or contamination of the ocean that our Pacific peoples depend on for their livelihoods. As the Assembly is well aware, we in the Pacific supply approximately 60 per cent of the worldâ??s tuna market, underscoring our regionâ??s global significance. Maintaining the health of our ocean is therefore not merely in our own interests. The maintenance of our ocean, given its importance to global food security, should be in all of our interests. In that regard, Solomon Islands reaffirms the principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the peaceful use of ocean spaces. While the threat of nuclear warfare is a genuine concern to us all, for our small island developing States the effects of climate change that we are currently witnessing at an alarming rate on our shores present a clear and present danger. The concentration of carbon dioxide in our oceans now stands at 400 parts per million. It has passed the safe level of 350 parts per million and at 550 parts per million will soon begin to dissolve our corals. For Pacific nations like ours, climate change continues to be our enemy. We are constantly invaded by that enemy, every day. In Solomon Islands, we have lost six islands to the effects of climate change. What was once a playground for children is now inundated with water. For many of our peoples, talk of a sustainable world is becoming increasingly unattainable. We are in survival mode. The horrors of the impact of a nuclear attack are undeniable, but the slow onset of tragedy caused by the adverse impact of climate change is just as cruel. If it has not happened yet, it will shortly. An unstable climate and peopleâ??s subsequent displacement and relocation can exacerbate some of the core drivers of conflict, such as migratory pressures, the clash of cultures and competition for resources. Those are threats to humankindâ??s very existence and could very well morph into threats to global peace and security. That is why the Pacific small island developing States have been requesting that the Security Council also address the issue of climate change. While useful, the building of sea walls and wave-breakers to mitigate some of the effects of climate change is a mere Band-Aid solution. We call on all major greenhouse-gas emitters to meet their national determined contributions for reducing emissions. We strongly urge the United States of America to reconsider its position on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Let us all stand together in solidarity to face the defining challenges of our time. With regard to the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties, Solomon Islands pledges its full support to Fiji as Chair. As a fellow Pacific island country, we congratulate Fiji on its upcoming assumption of the chairship and look forward to discussions on effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. Regarding peace and security, Solomon Islands has contributed a contingent of five police officers who have just completed their 12-month tour of duty in the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, in our first humble contribution to the maintenance of world peace. Another eight police officers, two of whom are women, are all set to go as soon as they secure their visas for the Sudan. The African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur was set up to protect civilians in areas where militia groups continue to be active and intercommunal violence still occurs. The efforts could be made more effective if the United Nations Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes could be integrated into predeployment and in-theatre training for all peacekeepers. The mandate of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands ended on 30 June. On behalf of the people of Solomon Islands, I would like to sincerely thank members of the Pacific Islands Forum for coming to our aid to save us from ourselves. At this juncture, I would like to pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Mission and to thank their families for their loved onesâ?? services. I am also deeply grateful to Australia and New Zealand for their excellent leadership role in the Assistance Mission, which was premised on a regional security framework, the Biketawa Declaration. My Government is also very supportive of the Pacific islands leadersâ?? communiquÃ© from the forty-eighth Forum meeting, which calls for a comprehensive expansion and updating of the Declaration. We believe that a Biketawa-plus that takes into consideration the security challenges the region faces today, as well as our collective responses to them, will help to keeping the Pacific islands region peaceful. Like other post-conflict countries, Solomon Islands will continue to face many challenges. Sustainable peace will require more than just effective policing or a functioning public service. It will require social and economic development initiatives that address the underlying causes of the conflict. In that regard, I must thank the Peacebuilding Commission for facilitating our national dialogue on peace and sustainable development. The communiquÃ© from that dialogue shows an inclusive and clear consensus on our priorities for sustaining peace. I therefore look forward to Solomon Islands being formally declared eligible for peacebuilding support from the Peacebuilding Recovery Facility. I must also thank the Board of the Green Climate Fund for approving $86 million for the Tina River Hydro Project when it met in South Korea early this year. The project will create more than 200 jobs and offset more than 44,000 tons of carbon dioxide per annum in diesel emissions. It will also provide renewable energy, at a more affordable cost, to more than 100,000 people in and around our capital city of Honiara. I currently have an issue with the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and the joint submission by Papua New Guinea, the Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands concerning the Ontong Java plateau. Solomon Islands notes with serious concern that the Commission, in its deliberations, has overturned the understanding that we had reached with the Sub-Commission on the connection of Duff and Anuta Islands to the continental margin of the Ontong Java plateau. The Sub-Commission and our joint delegation reached mutually acceptable conclusions that were the result of comprehensive interactions over two years. However, we were not given the opportunity to address the amendments proposed by the Commission, despite their serious implications for our submission, nor were we given the reasons for the amendments despite our repeated requests. We therefore have no option but to consider making a revised submission. A related issue is the negotiations on an implementing agreement under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions. The current negotiations undermine the fundamental principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and are grossly inadequate when addressing the principle of adjacency, the integration of traditional knowledge, and transboundary and cumulative impacts as they relate to small island developing States. There must also be some recognition for a funding mechanism that can adequately support the implementation of the proposed instrument. The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations speaks powerfully of our mission to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. This language clearly articulates the principle of universality for all peoples and nations, regardless of their size or population. However, as we in the Assembly speak of leaving no one behind, we are at the same time shutting the door for the people of Taiwan in participating in this universal process. We are thereby contradicting our own principles by leaving 23 million people behind. And yet the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires global partnership and the joint efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize all available resources. Taiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in and contribute to the wide range of substantive United Nations programmes for the welfare of humankind. If we are to focus on people and promote peace and sustainability, let us give Taiwan and its 23 million people a chance. Let us not contradict the principles that the United Nations was established to represent and allow the rules to change based on whose best interests are at stake. Taiwan has been actively involved in United Nations programmes and specialized agencies. Despite its contributions to the well-being of the citizens of the world, we continue to ignore Taiwanâ??s right to self- determination; as such, it is high time that the Assembly gave due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member of the family of nations. Article 73 of our Charter also speaks powerfully on fundamental human rights. In the 1960 Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, the General Assembly stated: â??The subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperationâ?? (resolution 1514 (XV), para. 1). Thanks to that Article, the people of New Caledonia will hold a referendum in 2018 whereby they can finally decide, without fear or favour, on their political future. I wish them all the best. I must thank and commend the administering Power for working closely with the Special Committee on Decolonization (Committee of 24) on the issue of New Caledonia. I hope that the same level of cooperation will also be shown on French Polynesia and that a visit by the Committee of 24 will occur soon. The position of Solomon Islands on the issues I have mentioned is premised on principles that we have consistently upheld. In this connection, Solomon Islands condemns the consistent human rights violations in West Papua. Our Sustainable Development Goals, which promote the notion of no one being left behind, will be empty promises unless we in the United Nations take active steps to address the plight of the peoples of West Papua. Indeed, we left them behind some 50 years ago when, as a family of nations, we noted their plight without adding much. Since then, the peoples of West Papua have never been allowed the proper act of self-determination guaranteed by the inalienable right to self-determination, as expressed in United Nations human rights covenants. Only the international action of individual countries and the leading organizational bodies of the international system, especially the General Assembly, can pave the way for the recognition of a people whose right to self-determination has been denied for nearly 50 years. Failing that, we as a family of nations will become complicit in perpetuating suffering and being blind to injustice, missing yet another golden opportunity to remain true to the idea of leaving no one behind. At the seventy-first session, a group of Pacific Island nations called for the General Assembly to address the human rights violations in West Papua. Today, I stand before the Assembly on behalf of my people and those of the Pacific region to reiterate that same call to address the plight of West Papuan women, children and men. Our people are watching, West Papuans in West Papua are watching, praying and hoping for a brighter future. They have come in numbers to express their hope for a better future. We as leaders have the responsibility to leave no one behind. I would therefore encourage Indonesia to engage in more constructive dialogue, including with West Papua, to find a way forward in addressing the aspirations of the people of West Papua. I urge the United Nations to proactively engage in those dialogues as well. Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread violations of human rights worldwide, my country and region included. Violence against women is an obstacle to gender equality, economic opportunities and livelihoods. The final Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report, published in 2015, highlighted the fact that violence against women was an impediment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. If our region is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we will have to intensify efforts and increase support and cooperation to end violence against women and girls. The Solomon Islands Family Protection Act of 2014 was a national response to the urgent need to curtail the increasing rate of domestic violence. It was aimed at ensuring that homes in Solomon Islands, as important units of the community, are peaceful and safe for all members of a family. The Act covers any type of abuse that happens in the home between perpetrators and victims of domestic violence. Yes, we have made big strides in not just counting women, but more importantly, in making women count. As a small island developing State and least developed country with inherent structural capacity constraints, we greatly rely on the United Nations system to support and augment our national efforts in implementing national development programmes. It is our hope that this expectation will be met by concrete and measurable deliverables on the ground by our United Nations partners. My delegation welcomes the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform agenda and applauds his vision for repositioning sustainable development at the heart of the United Nations. Its guiding framework, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its pledge to leave no one behind, is indeed our boldest agenda for humankind. For my country, it will have to include fair representation in the recruitment of staff to the United Nations Secretariat. Despite having only one national at the Secretariat, we have not been invited to sit the young professionalsâ?? exams for two years in a row now. We nevertheless remain steadfast in our support and encouragement of action for a strong and effective United Nations, and we stand ready to support the Secretary-Generalâ??s noble efforts to transform the Organization, including the Security Council. The United Nations is still the town hall of our global village. People know what it does but do not see much value in it. It is inevitably imperfect. As the Organizationâ??s second Secretary-General, Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld, famously said, â??The United Nations was not created to take humanity to heaven, but to save it from hellâ??. The Organizationâ??s imperfections, however, only mean that we need to work harder to make it better. So let us do that.",1,196
7856,Session 72 - 2017,SLE_72_2017.txt,SLE_72_2017,72,2017,SLE,"I bring the Assembly fraternal greetings and very best wishes from His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone. President Koroma deeply regrets that he is unable to participate in the seventy- second session of the General Assembly, due to unavoidable circumstances. He has, however, instructed me to deliver the following message. â??I congratulate the President on his assumption of the responsibility for directing the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would like to assure him of my personal support and that of my country throughout his tenure. Let me also congratulate and warmly welcome our new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres. I commend and thank their predecessors, Mr. Peter Thomson and Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for their leadership and outstanding commitment to advancing our collective aspirations and energy, maintaining global peace and security and achieving sustainable development for all, as well as for their concern regarding climate change. â??In March of 2018, the people of Sierra Leone will go to the polls to elect their new leaders in local Government, parliamentary and judicial elections. A few months from now, my second term in office will come to an end, and I will be graciously handing over power to Sierra Leoneâ??s next democratically elected President. We have had 10 years of working together, 10 years of building and consolidating peace and democracy, of enjoying the atmosphere of a peaceful transfer of power, political party pluralism, a vibrant civil society and a critical media landscape. We are not yet where we want to be as a country, but with the sustained support of the international community, Sierra Leone is not where it was 10 years ago. â??Today, a country that was once regarded as a fragile State is ranked the most peaceful in West Africa and about the fourth most peaceful in Africa. We have raised our economy to become one of the fastest growing in Africa. Even when we were halted and derailed by the Ebola virus outbreak, with the international communityâ??s support, we fought hard, and once again we are registering a positive economic outlook. â??As I look back on those 10 years, as I look back on that long and challenging path we have travelled together, as I prepare to step aside, I do so with a sense of pride, a sense of fulfilment and a sense of satisfaction that we have played our parts in the rebuilding of our nation, in transforming lives and in giving hope to millions of people. â??Let me particularly commend the United Nations for its significant contribution to restoring peace, security, stability and economic reconstruction in my country. I am happy to note that today Sierra Leone is described by the United Nations, through the Peacebuilding Commission, as a proud storehouse of lessons for a seamless transition from war to peace, democracy and stability. Those lessons have provided us with valuable and cost-effective tools for the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. â??We have always been more than ready and willing to share those lessons with other countries in a similar plight, especially countries within our small g7+ group of post-conflict countries, which are striving to leave fragility behind and promote resilience. We have already held three highly successful and widely acclaimed peaceful, free and fair democratic elections following the end of the civil conflicts. Those are milestones that significantly demonstrate our exemplary performance in the consolidation of peace and security. The elections to be held will be no different in terms of transparency, fairness or credibility. â??The choice of the theme for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is apt and timely in an era of global uncertainties and challenges, including the emergence of new threats that tend to undermine our efforts in the promotion of economic and social advancement of all peoples. For 72 years, through this Organization, we have combined our efforts to prevent a major war and to promote human rights, fundamental freedoms, justice and equal rights for men and women of all races. Yet we are faced with unprecedented global challenges of enormous proportions. The seemingly unending cycles of conflict and violence, the destructive and devastating impacts of climate change, the spread of terrorism and the largest refugee, migration and humanitarian crises in recent history continue to call into question the effectiveness of our present international machinery, as well as our ability to promote sustainable peace and a decent life for all. â??We should therefore generate innovative ideas and credible mechanisms that will bring all conflicts to a peaceful end. We should promote social progress, peace and security, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We must secure better standards of life for humankind. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to building a sustainable planet for present and succeeding generations. This Assembly should, in that regard, reflect on reforms that will reinforce our collective obligation to upholding the purposes and principles on which our Organization was founded. â??The General Assembly has consistently reaffirmed our collective commitment to strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes and in conflict prevention and resolution. It is a valuable and cost-effective tool. It is Sierra Leoneâ??s firm belief that we must continue to build on the gains made in our preventive diplomacy efforts, including heightened collaboration with each other and among our regional organizations and actors, making use of experiences that have helped us achieve relative international peace and security. â??In that regard, I am heartened by the powerful impetus of the preferential use of preventive diplomacy and mediation efforts in the maintenance of international peace and security by the United Nations system. The good offices of the Secretary- General, including the early-warning system and the international contact groups, are important instruments in preventing conflicts and must be further strengthened to effectively respond to any crisis situation. The effective utilization of Chapter VI of the Charter therefore remains the best option for the Organization in the prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes. â??Obviously, mediation remains a powerful instrument for the prevention and settlement of armed conflicts and must be utilized to the fullest extent possible. My country has indeed benefited from mediation efforts under the auspices of the United Nations and the Economic Community of West African States. We have learned from experience that for mediation efforts to be fruitful, they must embrace such measures as the timely cessation of hostilities, credible ceasefire agreements and the timely deployment of peacekeeping and observer missions to be able to undertake and supervise the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and displaced persons. â??Furthermore, the role of regional organizations in partnership with the United Nations must be further strengthened to ensure a greater response at the regional level in implementing preventive measures such as early-warning mechanisms. Regional organizations are usually better positioned to generate the necessary political will for conflict prevention within their regions. â??The role of the Peacebuilding Commission has been exemplary, and its experience, expertise and knowledge in preventing conflicts from escalating into violence or war, as well as in supporting post- conflict endeavours, should be tapped into. In that regard, we encourage the sharing of the experiences gained and lessons learned through the engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission. â??As I have already stated, since I assumed the leadership of Sierra Leone almost 10 years ago, the country continues to make steady progress, particularly in the priority sectors of infrastructure, human development, agriculture and food security, democracy, international relations, justice, human rights and inclusive governance, as outlined in my medium-term development plan, the Agenda for Change, followed by the Agenda for Prosperity. Those transformative strategies have gone a long way to more visibly repairing and healing the damage and scars resulting from a brutal war, while also charting a path for achieving sustainable socioeconomic development and shared prosperity and, more particularly, for transforming Sierra Leone into a middle-income country by the year 2025. â??Three years ago, in 2014, the unexpected and unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola virus substantially wiped out the social and economic fabric and the gains that Sierra Leone had painstakingly achieved over 10 years of progressive post-conflict reconstruction efforts. Shortly after being recognized as one of the countries with the highest growth rate in the world, our economy plunged very sharply, from record high gross domestic product growth rates of 15.2 per cent and 20.1 per cent, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to record low rates of 4.6 per cent and -21.7 per cent, in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The epidemic revealed fundamental systemic weaknesses that still remained to be addressed in post-conflict Sierra Leone, especially in the health-care system. The fight to end, eradicate and prevent the recurrence of the Ebola virus was largely won through strong leadership, community ownership and national resilience. â??While we were on the verge of turning the corner in our post-Ebola recovery strides, Sierra Leone was severely hit by torrential rainfall in the early hours of 14 August, leading to flash flooding in several areas of the capital city, as well as the collapse of the hillside of Mount Sugarloaf, overlooking Freetown and its environs, causing widespread devastation. The impact has been penetrating and far-reaching, especially for women and children, who were most affected. More than 500 lives were lost, several people were severely injured and traumatized, more than 600 remain missing, around 7,000 were rendered homeless and physical property and assets worth an estimated $30 million were lost. â??This yearâ??s rainfall is the third in a series of heavy torrential rains with devastating impact, mostly on vulnerable groups in our cities. Such rains displace hundreds of people, destroy farmland, businesses and properties and cost lives. â??While I once again take this opportunity to thank the international community for its support during these moments of grief and need, let me state that such disasters are a stark reminder that climate change is real. They also demonstrate the level of Sierra Leoneâ??s vulnerability to climate change. I therefore reiterate Sierra Leoneâ??s support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and urge concerted global efforts in dealing with this immediate, real threat to humankind. â??Under my leadership, Sierra Leone has enhanced political stability by strengthening institutions and laying a basis for good governance by allowing those institutions sufficient leverage and latitude to deliver on their respective statutory mandates. My Government has recorded significant milestones in the areas of gender equality and womenâ??s empowerment, as well as in promoting youth employment and empowerment. We have established a more stable and regulatory environment for investment and wealth generation, which in the medium- and long-term will create employment opportunities for the inclusive socioeconomic development of young people, the disabled and women. â??My Governmentâ??s programmes for local Government and decentralization have provided greater space for wider and deeper community participation in our development trajectory. Furthermore, the launch of the Open Government initiative in 2008, followed by our membership of the Open Government Partnership in 2014, has together created an effective platform for transparent governance and citizensâ?? empowerment, thereby building trust and confidence between my Government and the people. With those developments, Sierra Leone is now on a solid path and will continue to consolidate its transition from war to peace and shore up democratic credentials, inclusive growth and a decent life for all. â??Learning from the Ebola virus outbreak, my Government has responded to the task of building a resilient health system to prevent, detect and respond to any public health threats of similar nature. We have established public-health laboratories nationwide that have full capabilities to test for viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola. The floods and mudslides are pointing us to a greater emphasis on the environment, particularly regarding land management, reforestation, affordable housing, urbanization and upgrading slums. â??While we remain determined to accelerate the positive transformation of Sierra Leone, ensuring that Sierra Leoneans benefit from the dividends of our well-earned peace and democracy, we look forward to more strategic engagement with our partners in effectively implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in Sierra Leone, especially in diversifying our economy, with a focus on agriculture, fisheries, tourism and manufacturing industries, as well as on investment in education and health. Evidence abounds that in those resource-full sectors there is enormous economic potential for public-private sector partnerships and for North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation. We urge our partners to join with us in tapping those potentials. â??As coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the United Nations Security Council Reforms, I would like to end my remarks by reiterating Africaâ??s concern about the slow pace of the reform process. We have heard that concern expressed by the current Chair of the African Union, His Excellency Professor Alpha CondÃ©, President of the Republic of Guinea, as well as by several other Heads of State and Heads of Government. â??Beyond the compelling urge to correct the historical injustice done to Africa, we must thoroughly reflect on the current geopolitical realities that generally compel the reform and modernization of the United Nations system, particularly the Security Council. We must also reflect on the continentâ??s numerical strength, its growing economic power, its population dynamics and its increasing role in the multilateral system. Against that background, Africaâ??s demand, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, is therefore even more legitimate and ought to be redressed and treated on the basis of equity in the global governance system. â??As we look at the work that lies ahead, let us not lose sight of our shared obligation to ensure a peaceful and secure world by resolving our differences, including national and international disputes, through constructive dialogue. We must respect and prioritize strengthening the existing mediation mechanisms provided in the Charter of the United Nations. I am convinced that the pace of global development and the achievement of peace and security will significantly accelerate if we appreciate the wisdom of redirecting resources from the current nuclear arms race to people-centred development. That will benefit humankind more than a continuation of the ruinous competition for superiority. It will also facilitate the attainment of our desired twin goals of sustainable peace and development. â??As I graciously bow out as President of my beloved country, I will be leaving office with the sincere hope that the successful implementation of the priorities and programmes that I have laid out will enhance Sierra Leoneâ??s attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. I also hope that the international community will continue to stand by the great and resilient people of Sierra Leone in the pursuit of our collective aspiration to become a middle-income country. It is my fervent hope that the current momentum and development trajectory, which are defined by transformative strategies and catalytic actions, will be maintained through a sustained United Nations partnership with my successor. I therefore thank all of our development partners, both at the bilateral and multilateral levels, who have collaborated with us to support the strides that we have achieved during my tenure.â??",1,196
7857,Session 72 - 2017,SLV_72_2017.txt,SLV_72_2017,72,2017,SLV,"Given that today is the International Day of Peace, it is an honour to present a message of achievements and challenges from the Republic of El Salvador on the global agenda to General Assembly at its seventy- second session. I would like to express our solidarity and condolences to the people and the Government of Mexico, which have faced a devastating earthquake. We extend the same message of sympathy to the Caribbean countries and the United States, which have been affected by hurricanes. El Salvador identifies with the central theme of this debate and agrees to follow up on such a vision for the fulfilment of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Agenda 2030 constitutes an important instrument for the dialogue and consensus- building processes in El Salvador. We have contributed our experiences to the discussion at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, to which we submitted our first national voluntary review on the implementation of Agenda 2030. El Salvador has a national agenda for sustainable development, which was developed through the creation of an institutional architecture for its implementation. We have allocated more than half of public spending to education, health and social protection in order to reduce extreme poverty and enhance social development. We have also increased the allocation of resources to programmes focused on poverty reduction. In the area of education, which is a priority for our Government, we have made significant progress in eradicating illiteracy and increasing the availability of an inclusive education, while maintaining a high level of primary-education coverage over the past four years. Also noteworthy are our advances in food and nutritional security, through which we have reduced chronic child malnutrition. We promote family farming by supporting small producers, improving their incomes and ensuring food security through participatory and sustainable processes. In order to address employment and opportunities we established the National Employment System, which benefits young people through programmes that bolster their capacities for work, and we are firmly committed to generating a favourable climate for foreign investment. Our duty as a society is to continue our efforts to build upon such positive outcomes and continue on the path to achieve Agenda 2030. It is important to point out that we have great challenges before us, especially in the fiscal area, where agreements are urgently needed if we are to achieve greater dynamism and economic development that goes hand in hand with social progress and benefits for the people. Such sustainable development requires an environment of peace and security, and for that reason we have promoted a process of dialogue at the political and multisectoral levels. It was out of that process that we developed the Plan El Salvador Seguro. It has a comprehensive approach aimed at addressing the phenomenon of violence, emphasizes prevention and firmly respects human rights. Two years after we began to implement it, we have seen good results, such as reducing the homicide rate by 50 per cent and achieving a similar percentage with regard to extortion. I must stress that without a financing strategy, adapting Agenda 2030 to national planning becomes a complex exercise. That is why I reiterate the pressing need to link Agenda 2030 to the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action, which sets out more than 100 measures and practices aimed at generating investment that will drive sustainable development over the next 15 years. In our case, we conceived a financing strategy that embraces all sources and calls for shared responsibilities with regard to achieving the SDGs at the national level. Against that backdrop, we recognize that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to eradicate poverty and inequality, presents a challenge for middle-income countries, such as El Salvador. For nations that are considered to fall in that category, it is imperative to eliminate measurements based solely on average income, or only on economic income, and that conceal economic, social and cultural inequalities. That is why we reaffirm the call to go beyond and move towards the implementation of a multidimensional calculation. It is equally relevant to refer to sovereign debt, given its negative impacts on development. A restructuring mechanism that promotes a fair and shared distribution between debtors and creditors based on human needs is a priority. On the other hand, a crucial issue for El Salvador is the issue of migration. It is very important to bear in mind that in 2015, when we adopted Agenda 2030, we recognized the positive contribution of migrants on inclusive growth and sustainable development. That is why my country promoted the inclusion of the migration issue in the SDGs, and we have prioritized it in our national agenda for sustainable development. We believe that achieving a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration presents a true opportunity, but also a challenge. It is an opportunity that will enable us to tackle the issue of migration from a standpoint that ensures human development and human rights, and a challenge that we must commit to addressing in order to eliminate stereotypes that stigmatize migration as a criminal act. Today, as anti-migration policies and movements gather strength throughout the world, we most energetically condemn xenophobia directed against refugees and migrants. My country therefore believes that it is vital to acknowledge the positive contributions and participation of migrants in their destination societies and their positive effect on sustainable development. One example of that contribution is our temporary protected-status population in the United States, for whom we hope that such status will be extended. We should facilitate conditions that seek to regulate immigration status and promote the rights of migrants, as well as their integration into the host country culture and labour market, and their health care, education and housing systems, and acknowledge the contribution that they make to the economies of their host societies. In line with that position, we have submitted an initiative to our Legislative Assembly to help regulate the migratory situation of nationals who come from neighbouring countries to El Salvador, mostly for work. In July 2017 we launched our national policy for the protection and development of Salvadoran migrants and their families as a tool aimed at strengthening the protection and promotion of the development of Salvadorans abroad and of their relatives at home, as well as the returning population. In order to obtain a culture of peace at the global level, it is essential to recognize and give priority to dialogue and peaceful solutions to controversies. As a country that suffered internal armed conflict for over a decade and was able to find lasting solutions only through dialogue and negotiation, we know very well how important peaceful means are for resolving disputes. In that context, we welcome the fresh efforts for dialogue between the opposition and the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. We congratulate the President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, on that important initiative. Furthermore, I call for an end to the economic blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba, so that we may begin a new chapter in our Caribbean history and look firmly ahead to the future. We hope for an advance in relations between those two neighbours and hope that other unilateral measures that hinder progress and the well-being of both peoples will be avoided. My country firmly supports all initiatives that promote and strengthen the disarmament regime, arms regulation and the fight against organized crime and terrorism, and all efforts to achieve international security and world peace. I reiterate our concern in the face of the threat posed to humankind by the existence of weapons of nuclear destruction. The use or threat of use of such weapons is a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international and humanitarian law. In another area, we must adopt urgent measures to combat the negative effects of climate change, which continue to compromise economic development, natural resources and the well-being of countries such as El Salvador, which produces few greenhouse gases. It concerns us to see regression in the international consensus to fight the negative effects of climate change at the multilateral level. I wish to end by highlighting that the peace agreements that we signed in 1992, which have now reached their twenty-fifth birthday, taught us that the best victories are those won through the hard work and will of all parties. In that vein, I express my gratitude to the Secretary-General for the support and solidarity that he has provided us with in the process of national dialogue that we are developing in El Salvador, which is now in its second stage towards reaching an agreement. In that same spirit of joint work and cooperation, I call on Member States to unite in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, truly focusing on people, so that no one is left behind and all those living on this planet can do so in dignity and peace.",1,196
7858,Session 72 - 2017,SMR_72_2017.txt,SMR_72_2017,72,2017,SMR,"On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session and to wish you a successful term. Your experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Slovakia and your deep knowledge of international affairs are invaluable resources for the United Nations. The San Marino delegation assures you of its utmost willingness to work with you in the course of this session of the General Assembly. My country would also like to offer its heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres as he embarks on fulfilling his new mandate as Secretary-General. We thank him for the energy and determination he has already shown in his first months of activity at the helm of the Organization. I am grateful for the theme chosen for this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? where issues that the Republic of San Marino holds dear, such as human rights, peace and sustainable development, are at the heart of the agenda. It is a cross-cutting theme, since upholding human rights is reflected in every action the United Nations takes in the service of peace, security, justice and sustainable development. In the coming years, the international community will have to do all it can to achieve these objectives. To our dismay, in every situation of armed conflict we are witnessing the systematic violation of human rights. Refugees and migrants are subject to discrimination, various forms of abuse and trafficking. Racial and religious discrimination and intolerance persist in many parts of the world. Inequality and social exclusion are at the root of the numerous and increasingly complex challenges that the United Nations is called upon to address. Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen an increase in inequality and marginalization, not only in developing countries but even in the richest ones, where increasingly large sections of the population struggle against growing poverty. This is a threat to global stability, as it leads to an erosion of confidence in national and multilateral institutions and fuels nationalist and populist movements. Collective commitment to human rights is therefore essential. The relationship between peace, security and respect for human rights is undeniable. Measures for the protection and promotion of human rights are essential to preventing conflicts and ensuring peace. Moreover, peace and sustainable development are complementary concepts. More inclusive and peaceful societies provide better conditions for sustainable development, and vice versa. The complexity of the challenges that the United Nations must tackle today is unparalleled in the history of the Organization. Their interconnected nature reminds us that countries must act together to be more effective in the fight against climate change, global terrorism and poverty and to build more inclusive, safe and just societies for all. As the Secretary-General stated in his report on the work of the Organization (A/72/1), it is important to rekindle faith in multilateralism and, in particular, in the United Nations. Our country has always believed in the power of dialogue and respect for others, which are values that underpin the peaceful coexistence among peoples. The profoundly egalitarian nature and unquestioned legitimacy of the United Nations, together with the universal character of participation in it, unequivocally reaffirm its value and central role as a forum for solving global problems. The various religious and cultural traditions present in the Organization should be not an obstacle but rather a valuable resource for achieving global solutions through mediating and synthesizing diversities. The United Nations must adapt quickly to new global challenges and to the new opportunities offered by an increasingly interconnected world so that it can be effective in carrying out its mandate. Reform is therefore crucial to future stability in the world and to the maintenance of international peace and security, which must remain at the centre of our actions. We reject any diminution of the role of the United Nations just because a universal agreement on the reforms needed to improve its functioning cannot be found. The Republic of San Marino is attentively following the revitalization process of the General Assembly, which must continue to be a meeting point and forum for the exchange of ideas and discussion, leading to solutions rooted in a strong consensus. Similarly, Security Council reform should be an objective of all Member States. As we have stated on previous occasions, we believe that intergovernmental negotiations contribute to agreements that reflect a broad and strong political consensus representing the interests of all negotiating groups. San Marino calls for reform that can make the Security Council more democratic, transparent, efficient and accountable. This goal can be achieved only through continuous dialogue among States, with the understanding that it is essential to go beyond initial positions if the broadest agreements possible are to be achieved. The Republic of San Marino supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform agenda, which features streamlining procedures, decentralizing decision-making processes and achieving greater transparency and accountability. Human rights are the raison dâ??Ãªtre of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Agenda defines our future and a vision of a peaceful, inclusive and safe society where the burden of poverty has been eradicated, prosperity is shared and decent work is available to all. Together with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, it also reflects the ambition and commitment of Member States to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, giving our planet and its inhabitants the chance to live longer and in better conditions. The 2030 Agenda is ambitious because it is universal: it integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development â?? social, economic and environmental â?? and is applicable to all States. A year after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, their effective implementation is the real challenge of today. In many areas covered by the 2030 Agenda, progress has unfortunately not been in line with hopes. For example, much more needs to be done for the 700 million people living in extreme poverty and experiencing malnutrition. More targeted actions should be implemented to reduce maternal mortality and gender inequality, ensure inclusive and equitable educational systems, invest in sustainable energy and provide health care to wider segments of the population. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is the responsibility of individual States, which should keep their promises by incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals into their development legislation and policies. A cultural revolution must be part of our policies in the coming years. In the Republic of San Marino, for instance, we have promoted education initiatives on sustainable development in various sectors, including education, construction, waste disposal and public transport. As a complement to national Governments, civil society and the private sector also play important roles in mobilizing the resources needed for the implementation of the Agenda. In this regard, San Marino recalls the important results achieved following the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which identified various concrete measures that could be taken to finance development and laid the foundation for the global programme contained in the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda states that the rights of the most vulnerable people must be promoted and protected. The Republic of San Marino has always paid special attention to the most vulnerable groups â?? women, children, the elderly and the disabled. San Marino, which was among the first countries to become signatories to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, intends to fully implement that Convention by adopting legislative frameworks and policies that favour the inclusion and full participation of people with disabilities in the employment, social and cultural contexts of the country. Gender equality must be a goal of the international community. Unfortunately, women are still victims of discrimination and violence in many parts of the world, including in the most developed countries. In support of the initiatives promoted by the Secretary- General, San Marino has signed the voluntary compact on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We believe that the rights and dignity of the victims of sexual abuse should be at the heart of our collective efforts. Children are sadly the most vulnerable group of all and can be victims of violence, abuse and exploitation. Protecting their rights must be at the heart of our actions. San Marino supports the Ministerial Declaration made at this yearâ??s High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which reaffirms the commitment of the international community to children, focusing in particular on eradicating poverty, promoting their participation and eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination. Refugees and migrants continue to be subject to violent discrimination. The enormous humanitarian challenge posed by large movements of refugees and migrants can be addressed only through greater cooperation and better sharing of responsibilities and costs among all States. The movement-of-peoples phenomenon has reached a level unprecedented in the history of the United Nations. The Republic of San Marino supports the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted in September 2016. It contains a series of bold commitments to addressing the challenges posed by the large flows of migrants and refugees, but it also provides for developing a plan for the implementation of these commitments. In addition to dealing with large movements of refugees and migrants, the United Nations has also been called on to address grave and complex humanitarian crises. As the Secretary-General mentioned in his report on the activity of the Organization, approximately 96 million people, in more than 40 countries, more than half of whom were women and children, received humanitarian assistance in 2017. The report shows that in 2016, natural disasters caused the displacement of approximately 31 million people, three times more than those forced to flee because of armed conflicts. An unprecedented food crisis has affected more than 20 million people on the African continent. The Republic of San Marino has always supported cooperation projects and emergency interventions under the auspices of numerous international organizations, in particular entities within the United Nations family. Our country is grateful to the Secretary-General for the rapid and crucial action he has undertaken for populations facing humanitarian emergencies, as well as to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Central Emergency Response Fund for their rapid response and substantial contribution. Today, the United Nations is engaged in the widest deployment of peacekeeping operations and special political missions in its history. Recent and ongoing wars have caused great suffering for civilians, unprecedented global humanitarian crises, tragic, massive movements of migrants and refugees, and an increase in terrorism, violent extremism, populism and intolerance. Despite the negotiations for a political solution in Syria, which resumed in January under the auspices of the United Nations, facilitated by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, to whom the Republic of San Marino gives its full support, the situation remains highly volatile, has led to a massive displacement of civilians and, at the same time, poses a threat to the stability of the entire region. The Republic of San Marino supports the Secretary- General in his initiative aimed at strengthening prevention activities and conflict mediation. In this regard, my country will participate in the Italian initiative for the creation of a network of women mediators in the Mediterranean area, the purpose of which is to contribute to peace processes through prevention and mediation. By establishing relations with the various national or regional stakeholders and working to achieve sustainable peace, the United Nations should be able to anticipate the causes of a possible conflict. More and more frequently, terrorism and violent extremism are generated and fuelled by armed conflicts, exacerbating ethnic, religious, political and economic tensions. Violations of human rights by such terrorist groups as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Qaida and Boko Haram are very serious and include murder, kidnapping, forced conversion, human trafficking, slavery, sexual abuse, and the destruction of places of religious or cultural significance for ethnic and religious minorities. The self-proclaimed Islamic State and its associated forces have also been responsible for numerous deadly terrorist attacks in Europe, Asia and Africa. The international community and the United Nations must act so that those responsible for those heinous crimes are brought to justice. San Marino supports the activities and initiatives of the United Nations in promoting justice and the rule of law, which form an integral part of the agenda to promote and protect human rights. My country welcomes the actions taken by the Secretary-General, with the support of the General Assembly, to establish the Office of Counter-Terrorism, headed by an Under-Secretary-General, with a view to enhancing coherence in United Nations action and provide better assistance to Member States in their own fight against terrorism. Disarmament activity plays a crucial role in maintaining international peace and security. The recent tests carried out by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea in the context of a nuclear- weapons programme threaten security globally as well as regionally and underline the need for robust disarmament and non-proliferation policies. San Marino strongly condemns the launching of missiles by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea and demands that it cease such activity. We also call for the sanctions set forth in recent Security Council resolutions to be fully implemented by all States. The Republic of San Marino took part in the negotiations that led to the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last July. The Treaty is an important step in efforts aimed at achieving the shared goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In order to address todayâ??s many and complex challenges, the United Nations must be more effective and flexible. Member States must assume their responsibilities in that regard, including that of helping our Organization live up to its mandate, which is to protect the citizens of the world. Thanks to its centuries-long history of peace and freedom, San Marino is a State with a strong identity. Although our State is small, it is proud to make its contribution to the United Nations community. Everything we do is aimed at restoring the capacity and authority of the United Nations, so that it can continue to be the indispensable reference point of the international community.",1,196
7859,Session 72 - 2017,SOM_72_2017.txt,SOM_72_2017,72,2017,SOM,"It is an honour to address the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I bring warm greetings and good wishes from our President, His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, and the entire Government and the people of the Federal Republic of Somalia. Allow me first to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his assumption of his post and his capable work in steering this organ towards a successful session. Yesterday we observed the International Day of Peace, a day that calls for togetherness and solidarity with those who have been forced to flee their homes and those who leave home to seek a better life. The theme of this yearâ??s General Assembly session speaks of peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet. The similarity in focus goes beyond coincidence to acknowledge that the pursuit of peace, a decent life, respect, safety and dignity is a global need. Yet it is elusive for hundreds of millions of people in the world today. From Syria to the Central African Republic, from the Rohingya people of Myanmar to the people of Libya, the number of protracted and new conflicts remains unacceptably high. The Somali people have for many years been the victims of war, famine and poverty, which has seen some of them displaced internally, while others made the perilous journey abroad. We are therefore all too familiar with the need for others to open their doors to distraught and disillusioned people who, just like us, are seeking a safe and dignified life. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who, even in challenging times, continue to uphold that spirit of oneness, sharing and caring. Somalia is rising, and we are determined to stay the course. Our aim is to contribute positively to the progress of our region, our continent and the world. Despite the enormous challenges, we are, among other things, improving security, re-establishing law and order and conducting the necessary political and socioeconomic reforms. The progress we have achieved so far is the result of our peopleâ??s embrace of a new dawn and our steadfast partnersâ?? willingness to continue supporting us on our journey towards peace and prosperity. We will continue to formulate measures to strengthen Somaliaâ??s progress, including in revenue generation. However, we are dealing with some serious challenges beyond the control of the Somali Government. Debt relief would have the effect of unlocking concessional financing, attracting foreign investment and providing an opportunity that is critical to sustaining our reform efforts, and consequently reinvigorating our economy. We are already working with international financial institutions towards that objective and, through this forum, seek the support of the international community. Terrorism remains one of our pressing challenges. Its repercussions are felt around the globe. Our unity in addressing this scourge, both collectively and sustainably, is therefore critical. No effort should be spared to neutralize the growth and influence of international terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and Al-Qaida, which, as we know, are key influencers of localized terrorism. Efforts to step up military interventions against such groups should be redoubled. We in Somalia have made significant strides that have weakened the capability of Al-Shabaab. In that regard, I would like to thank those participating in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) for their sacrifice, unfailing support, dedication and solidarity in the fight against Al-Shabaab. In order to ensure that such gains are sustainable, we are focused on strengthening the military capacity of our national security forces. However, the arms embargo imposed on Somalia severely limits our ability to achieve that objective. The Federal Government of Somalia will continue to work with the Security Council and relevant actors on our road map to get it lifted. Poverty and a lack of education and livelihood opportunities continue to contribute to the growth of violent extremism. Across the world, disillusioned young people are at a heightened risk of exploitation by criminal networks, including terrorists. The need to invest in education, skill-building and livelihood opportunities for our youth is urgent. Addressing those key strategic elements in order to counter terrorism is an enormous task that requires a holistic approach and resources to match. We continue to call on friends of Somalia to help us in such an important undertaking. We cannot talk about a sustainable planet without demonstrating a commitment to making the world livable for ourselves and future generations. Somalia is one of the countries that have been ravaged by a vicious cycle of man-made and natural disasters directly created by environmental degradation. Scarce rains lead to crop failure and the death of livestock, which subsequently lead to drought and famine. Currently, the humanitarian situation of millions of Somalis remains fragile, as the bite of the current drought, which still threatens to develop into famine, continues. Our national development plan outlines a clear and realistic road map towards breaking that vicious cycle. However, Somalia and many other countries that are on the receiving end of climate change have been unable to come up with the resources required to tackle this ever-growing problem. In that regard, we urge all Member States to continue improving the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which has the potential to mitigate the issueâ??s effects. Similarly, developing countries like Somalia need investment in long-term initiatives, including infrastructure development, water conservation, innovative food and livestock production and the creation of livelihood opportunities. We must get better at streamlining global development and aid structures, especially for fragile States. We must revisit the prevailing paradigms and take bold and innovative steps to improve that architecture. The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, adopted in South Korea in 2011, was certainly a great step in that direction. Somalia fully embraced the New Deal. Yet even with all of its strengths, the New Deal needs improvement. That said, the principles of mutual accountability that are embedded in the framework are exactly what fragile countries like Somalia need. It often happens that pledges are made, only to be later neglected. That should not be the case, because fragile countries rely on such support to rebuild their States. Conversely, development partners are often frustrated with fragile countriesâ?? weak transparency and accountability institutions. That is a legitimate concern. As fragile nations, we must do better by tackling corruption and plugging leaks. Somalia recently took bold steps to address corruption. Our anti-corruption bill, which is critical for putting in place measures for good governance and accountability, has been approved by my Cabinet and introduced for enactment by Parliament. The leadership of my country has also reiterated its zero-tolerance policy on corruption. Also related to funding, we must find predictable financing for non-United Nations peacekeeping missions. That is particularly true for AMISOM. AMISOM has registered tremendous success for more than a decade, and yet each year it continues to operate with uncertainty about its funding. We believe that investment in peacekeeping is a worthy investment in peacebuilding and State-building. We have seen the dividends of such investment in Somalia. I look forward to engaging with our partners on that matter in the coming weeks and months. A fundamental element of peacebuilding and State-building is how any country treats its marginalized and voiceless citizens. Women are crucial in decision-making and represent an investment in society. In spite of our many challenges, Somalia has made significant steps in that regard. During the 2016 election, the number of women in Parliament increased from 14 to 24 per cent of the total. Although we missed our target of 30 per cent, we have improved markedly from a few years ago. Six months ago, when I was forming my Council of Ministers, I appointed six women to my Cabinet. They hold some of the most important portfolios in our nation, including in trade and industry, health, youth and sports, women and human rights and humanitarian affairs. Women have played an instrumental role in Somalia during our worst times. In addition to being mothers, wives and sisters, they dominate the informal economy. Many living as refugees and migrants remain the lifeline of their families through remittances sent to Somalia. Similarly, young people are vital to peacebuilding and State-building. The number of youths in our Parliament has increased exponentially. I have also appointed a number of very young people to key Cabinet positions. Tragically, one of them, Mr. Abbas Siraji, was killed in May. He was a beacon of hope for Somaliaâ??s young people. Having grown up in Kenya, in the worldâ??s largest refugee camp, he worked hard, studied and worked for various United Nations agencies. I appointed him Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction when he was 31. Although he is no longer with us, his appointment brought out the potential of thousands of young people across the country. He showed them that life in the refugee camps, harsh as it was, did not mean the end of hope. Human rights is one of the core principles of the United Nations. We are working hard to ensure respect for the human rights of all people. Our establishment of institutions such as our National Human Rights Commission, which is mandated to protect and promote human rights, will be a significant step in that direction. Vital legislation on human rights, such as the soon-to-be-approved sexual offences bill, will provide the tools to fight impunity for perpetrators of sexual crimes. However fond we are of our traditions, that should never be a reason to condone impunity. My Government is determined to find ways to harmonize our traditional dispute-resolution approach and the conventional justice system in a manner that respects the human rights of its people. The United Nations continues to be the worldâ??s most important shared platform for nations to develop and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. It is a core United Nations principle for States to respect one anotherâ??s political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is a principle that should be promoted and upheld at all times, especially when engaging with fragile States, such as Somalia. In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to add my voice to those supporting reform of the United Nations. The Organization has worked for peace and stability for decades, and I strongly believe that the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform agenda will most certainly lead to a far more responsive and dynamic institution. As a country that has greatly benefited from the United Nations system, we have also seen that it can improve its overall efficiency. With that, I would like to conclude by once again reminding all of us that we must redouble our efforts to focus on peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. That will take collective recognition of the fact that what happens in one corner of the world can affect those in other corners, too.",1,196
7860,Session 72 - 2017,SSD_72_2017.txt,SSD_72_2017,72,2017,SSD,"I am honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan, who unfortunately could not be present today owing to pressing domestic commitments back home. I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. South Sudan affirms it commitment to playing its role in supporting you as you lead this historic session. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres and his Deputy, Her Excellency Amina Mohammed, for winning the confidence of this institution. South Sudan stands ready to cooperate and work closely with them. The theme the President selected for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, resonates very well with the aspirations of our nation for peace, unity, development and prosperity. It is also in line with President Salva Kiir Mayarditâ??s declaration of 2017 as the Year of Peace and Prosperity. That solemn declaration is intended to cement our resolve that the aspirations of our people, for which they have fought long and hard, be realized. However, the realization of peace is greatly impeded by a lack of resources. We commend the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union (AU) and international partners to shun and isolate political actors who seek power through violence. We urge all stakeholders to continue embracing that common position, and we renew our commitment to further building on the progress we have made in order to ensure that our people inherit the future that we have always envisioned and aspired to. Nonetheless, we do not wish to delude ourselves that peace, unity and development can be achieved overnight. On the contrary, they require relentless and concerted efforts, dedication and commitment by all partners, which we are willingly, consciously and vigorously pursuing. We strongly believe that peace is not a one-day affair or event. For us and our friendly partners in peace, there is simply no other viable alternative to making peace. Nonetheless, bringing about peace takes time. Attaining peace in South Sudan is a process that will require our collective efforts. It is a consistent and persistent accumulation of positive steps towards achieving the world that we envision for the future generations in our country, in our continent and in our world at large. It is therefore against that backdrop that the South Sudanese Transitional Government of National Unity has embraced the full implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan as the only instrument pivotal to achieving that mission and vision. By way of updating the General Assembly, allow me to highlight some of the important steps that our Government has taken to further enhance the achievement of peace in our young country. The Transitional Government of National Unity continues to stand by its commitment to implementing the unilateral ceasefire that was announced by President Salva Kiir Mayardit in May 2017, and continues to call to estranged opposition groups to reciprocate our gesture of extending an olive branch. With support from friendly partners, the Government has embarked upon implementing key aspects of the transitional security arrangements, such as security-sector reform, the cantonment of forces and the training of the Joint Integrated Police (JIP) in an effort to demilitarize our communities. We hope that the recently graduated JIP for Juba will be an example that can be emulated in other security sector institutions, especially through the overhaul and restructuring of the Sudan Peopleâ??s Liberation Army into a professional national army. The Transitional Government of National Unity is spearheading grass-roots intercommunal peace initiatives, as ongoing communal conflicts characterized by cattle-rustling, child abduction, high bride dowry and land disputes can be serious stumbling blocks to peace. It is essential to find ways to transform the way our communities interact with each other, and the international community should encourage and support Government efforts and invest in measures aimed at addressing those local conflicts so that success stories can be replicated all over South Sudan at different phases of our national dialogue. It is in that area that I would like to highlight the role of young South Sudanese as either agents of, or detractors from, peace. One example of an intercommunal feud involving cattle-rustling and child abduction almost escalated into an uncontrolled conflict simply because the youth from the different communities were incited to violence. That makes us appreciate that our collective effort to ensure the situation in South Sudan can be salvaged only by embracing peace. I also wish to highlight the important role that South Sudanese women continue to play as peacebuilders and custodians of intercommunal peace initiatives. It is against that background that the Transitional Government of National Unity, with the support of religious leaders, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, the United Nations Development Programme and other partners, is engaging in grass-roots, people-to-people peace by investing in improving economic activities among communities, such as building markets, rehabilitating schools, constructing fishing storage facilities and peacefully disarming armed communities. All of that has improved relations among warring communities, host communities and internally displaced persons. We in South Sudan are currently optimistic about the return of peace. We have recently witnessed refugees and internally displaced persons gradually returning to their villages voluntarily, and several steps within communities indicate that the movement towards coexistence and living in harmony is a reality. There will be challenges and reversals, but the direction of movement should be the big picture. We are very open to listening to counsel and to joint action, but we also expect our partners to acknowledge and reciprocate progress and to demonstrate some sense of respect and trust. An overtly confrontational approach risks creating a siege-and-bunker mentality. However, we are confident that soon violence and wars will be stories of the past in the Republic of South Sudan. The national dialogue initiative declared by President Salva Kiir Mayardit is making strong and steady progress with regard to the Governmentâ??s commitment to addressing a number of political and security issues, with a view to creating an enabling environment for dialogue. Some major steps taken include the release of prisoners, including journalists; the expansion of the Steering Committee to include all the relevant stakeholders in the country; an ongoing effort to reach out to opposition figures; and a declaration of unilateral cessation of hostilities. The primary objective of the national dialogue initiative is to promote reconciliation and enhance confidence in the peace process so as to make dialogue not just the only viable option for resolving conflict but also a foundation for the national constitutional review process. At this juncture, I would like to note that the Steering Committee for the National Dialogue Initiative has embarked upon engagement with all shades of political opinion, in particular those living outside South Sudan, in order to ensure that the national dialogue is inclusive and that its outcomes reflect the views of all components of the South Sudanese community. The Steering Committee is engaging teams of resource persons who will go to all the states, counties, payams and bomas to organize meetings with representatives of the relevant groups to seek their views on the grievances held by their people and to ensure that those grievances are effectively addressed and remedied. The results of those discussions in the states will be reported to the Steering Committee, which will in turn present them to the larger national dialogue conference. The process will end with recommendations and resolutions that will be presented to the national leadership under the presidency and to the national Parliament for final adoption and implementation. Our Government is supportive of the efforts aimed at revitalizing the implementation of the peace agreement. We recently convened in our capital, Juba, a meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers to deliberate on ways to further expedite the preparation for the establishment of a high-level revitalization forum, which is envisaged to focus on practical ways to expedite the implementation of the peace agreement. Today South Sudan enjoys cordial relations with its neighbours. Those countries â?? Ethiopia, Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda â?? are hosting South Sudanese refugees, providing corridors for humanitarian access and supporting development projects, all of which further enhance the efforts of the Transitional Government of National Unity to bring about peace. We are dependent upon those good relations in order to revive and increase oil production, construct and maintain important road infrastructure and provide electricity in the border towns â?? key ingredients for boosting the economy and work as incentives for peace. Concerning Abyei, our Government reaffirms its willingness and readiness to implement the proposal of the African Union High-level Implementation Panel for the Sudan and South Sudan, of 21 September 2012, which, as presented by the Panel, was accepted by President Salva Kiir Mayardit. We are hopeful that the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan will soon resume cooperation in implementing that proposal. I wish to report to the Assembly that our Government is cooperating with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and is facilitating the deployment of the Regional Protection Force (RPF). In the past few months we have witnessed the arrival of members of the advance RPF, as agreed with the United Nations. The Government reaffirms its commitment to working closely with the United Nations, the AU and IGAD to oversee the smooth implementation and operationalization of the mandate of those troops in South Sudan. The Transitional Government of National Unity continues to work towards ensuring that humanitarian access to those in need is unhindered. That has been done through continuous and open dialogue with aid agencies striving to have more humanitarian corridors opened up. I wish to commend the concerted efforts of the various humanitarian agencies that responded positively and worked to reverse the famine situation in parts of South Sudan. Despite some gains, I stress that continued support is necessary if we are to achieve a hunger-free South Sudan. I wish to take this opportunity to express our condolences and prayers to the families of those humanitarian aid workers who lost their lives in the line of duty in the Republic of South Sudan. While we appreciate that saving lives is important, we also ought to save livelihoods. We cannot continue to mop the floor while the tap is open. The old â??humanitarian intervention first and development laterâ?? paradigm is not a viable policy in the case of South Sudan. It is important to incentivize peace and stability through a balanced approach to development and embracing a new way of working. Stabilization and recovery initiatives are essential, and emergency support needs to be effectively complemented with some level of economic dynamism that provides a new platform for social cohesion and resilience-building. As partners, we all need to do business differently. As a Government, we will redouble our efforts to ensure access and improve the enabling environment for humanitarian intervention. It is our expectation that a smart combination and calibration of development and humanitarian support is needed to maintain positive momentum. Our ultimate goal and responsibility is to provide an opportunity for peace to all South Sudanese people, one that will enable them to choose their own leaders through free, fair and credible elections. Our focus for the remaining months of the transitional period, therefore, is to ensure that adequate preparation and a environment conducive to those elections are our top priorities, and we will see to it that peace is realized and that sufficient resources are allocated to that task. These efforts are core building blocks and prerequisites for boosting confidence among and within our communities, which will stimulate them to voluntarily and gradually return to their homes. I would like to reiterate our position that those efforts can be sustained if, and only if, all political actors continue to respect and reciprocate the unilateral ceasefire declared by President Salva Kiir Mayardit earlier this year. The progress we speak of can come about only when we start to see progress in the reform of the Security Council. Reform of the Council is an urgent task, since its current composition and functioning do not reflect the realities of the international community in the twenty- first century. In order to achieve concrete progress on Council reform, it is imperative to launch text-based negotiations in the intergovernmental negotiations during the Assemblyâ??s seventy-second session. In that connection, South Sudan wishes to add its voice in expressing its concerns with regard to the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula. South Sudan supports the call of the international community urging North Korea to fully comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions on nuclear tests and ballistic-missile launches. South Sudan urges North Korea to show sincere will and concrete actions towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. With regard to climate change, although South Sudanâ??s greenhouse-gas emissions are negligible, it is one of the countries worst affected by climate change. The country is experiencing recurring droughts. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is the fastest-warming country in the region, with flooding and the loss of biodiversity and of livelihoods. I am glad to inform the Assembly that South Sudan has ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and has prepared its national determined contributions and national adaptation programme of action to implement the projects embodied in both documents. Allow me now to extend my appreciation to the countries members of IGAD, IGAD-Plus, the AU and the Troika, and China, Japan, Germany and the broader international community for their support for the peace process and development in my country. Although we appreciate that South Sudan as a nation cannot operate in isolation, the direction of the way forward must be South-Sudanese-led and its solutions must be home grown if we are genuinely striving to achieve sustainable results. Long live South Sudan. Long live the United Nations.",1,196
7861,Session 72 - 2017,STP_72_2017.txt,STP_72_2017,72,2017,STP,"It is a great honour and joy for me to speak before the General Assembly for the first time as Head of State of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. The elections of 2016, which brought me to power, once again illustrated unequivocally the level of democracy in Sao Tome and Principe and the regular functioning of its institutions. At the outset, allow me to take this opportunity to dedicate the first few words of my statement to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajcÃ¡k, whom I congratulate on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and to whom I convey our full support for his mandate and wishes for his great success. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, for the manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its previous session, that is to say, judiciously, with enthusiasm and unselfishness, in an international context that has posed serious challenges to our Organization. I also take this opportunity, before such a distinguished audience, to congratulate Secretary- General AntÃ³nio Guterres on his outstanding election. I am convinced that his political stature will undoubtedly enable him to lead the United Nations and address the multiple global challenges involving the necessary reform of the Organization, including the Security Council, and efforts to promote peace, sustainable development and human rights. Within the context of the complex global environment, the current challenges facing our peoples and countries are forcing us to delve deeper into the guiding spirit that undergirded the foundation of our Organization as the ultimate and global guarantor in the search for peaceful and lasting solutions that are consensual and valid under international laws, so that we might reach the desired goals of peace, security, stability and progress for all humankind. As such, we can take advantage of this unique opportunity to pursue our collective reflection aimed at strengthening the role of the Organization. To that end, it is therefore urgent to carry out essential reforms that correspond to the dynamics of todayâ??s globalized world â?? that is, to enable the various specialized agencies of the United Nations to act swiftly, effectively and in accordance with to a process that was intended to be inclusive of all nations, as mandated under the Charter of the United Nations, signed on 26 June 1945 in San Francisco. On the other hand, we must strengthen our awareness of the need to implement mechanisms that allow for greater inclusion in decision-making and strategic planning, which are the guiding principles of international financial institutions, namely, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We firmly believe that that is the only way for the economies of the developing countries to integrate more swiftly into the global development process, whose benefits have not yet been fully reflected in our own countries, while allowing for the renewal and strengthening of the credibility of those institutions, which we consider to be of central importance to the functioning of the global financial system, and to support our economic growth efforts aimed at the social and human development of our populations. The theme of this session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, fits perfectly with the present reality in which we live and corresponds to the challenges we face in search of a better world. Therefore, because the primary focus of any national, regional or international policy is to prioritize people and their yearning for a better life, as well as the continuous improvement of the mechanisms needed to meet those goals, the effort to achieve world peace is urgent and encompasses fundamental values that, we are certain, we all stand for and strive to achieve. The serious conflicts that are troubling the world are of constant concern, and their harmful consequences â?? which affect the well-being of humankind, the balance of relations among our nations and our economic, social and human development â?? must be firmly and uncategorically eschewed by us all. In our view, the divisions that we are now seeing are the consequence of a lack of sincere, comprehensive and thoughtful dialogue among all parties. We cannot allow religious fanaticism, isolationism and populist rhetoric, which today are anachronisms â?? and I would even add selfish â?? to prevent us from accepting and living with othersâ?? differences or to continue to lead to such a degree of discord, thereby aggravating tensions and cutting short many lives, including those of our children, who, if they are well cared for, represent the real future of our planet. In that regard, we call for dialogue that will stress the central mediating role of our Organization in order to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is also necessary to stop the proliferation of weapons in Syria, where people continue to live under the threat of bomb attacks that have destroyed the country and torn apart its social fabric while claiming many innocent lives. There is also a need to accelerate dialogue and the peace process in the Middle East, to which we once again make a firm appeal from this rostrum to find a peaceful and negotiated solution respecting the right of the Palestinian people to conduct their own destiny, thereby respecting the basic principles of the United Nations. Similarly, there is an urgent need to find a solution at the negotiating table for the tensions in Ukraine, the issue of Western Sahara and our brother country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which we greet warmly, and express the wish that its institutions will soon be restored to their regular functions. Although the recent ministerial meeting of the African initiative for peace and national reconciliation in the Central African Republic, which took place in the Gabonese Republic on 17 July, was a step in the right direction, we have followed with great concern the deterioration of the security situation there, with incalculable humanitarian consequences, sadly pointing to a situation of genocide. We therefore appeal for efforts to be made to avoid another humanitarian disaster in that African country. We cannot but deplore the terrorist acts that unfortunately continue to claim so many lives throughout the world. The barbarity and disrespect for the precious good that is human life, committed through those indescribable, appalling and inhumane acts, warrant our firmest and vehement condemnation. In that regard, we underline the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, among others, in our neighbouring and sister country Nigeria, which destabilized the entire region and severely slowed the implementation of sustainable development policies. Furthermore, they have an undeniable echo in the deterioration of security in the Gulf of Guinea, where acts of maritime piracy and the illegal activities associated with it have plagued our region. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, a State that is peaceful, democratic and open to dialogue, will always stand side by side with its regional and international partners in all initiatives seeking to eradicate that phenomenon from our societies. If, as the theme of the session invokes, we truly want to create the conditions for people to lead decent lives, it is urgent to address the problem of migratory crises. Every day, we are confronted with the tragedies of thousands of people who, as they seek to escape conflicts and the miserable conditions that affect their countries, risk perishing on trips in precarious circumstances as they go in search of a better life. There should be no doubt that no one leaves their homeland or faces such dangers on a whim. There is a civic, ethical and moral responsibility to welcome those people and provide them with the indispensable humanitarian assistance necessary, but also to create conditions conducive to mitigating the phenomenon in the countries of origin. That involves the adoption of concerted policies for the reception of refugees and the provision of support to countries of origin with a view to fostering an environment of peace and stability, so that they can provide the conditions necessary for their people to take part in the life projects they choose. We also underline the important work of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, under the co-chairmanship of Germany and Morocco, which began in January and will run until the end of 2018. This shared leadership has made contributions to the United Nations Global Compact for Migration, which, we are convinced, will lead to the much-desired policy of improved global migration to be adopted by the international community in 2018. We also welcome the recent French initiative that brought together a European-Africa joint mini-summit, held in Paris in late August, that sought to find ways to overcome Africaâ??s significant migratory flow to Europe, which has also transformed the Mediterranean Sea into a veritable cemetery. I cannot fail to mention the Sustainable Development Goals, the priorities of which go directly to the core of what we have been expressing. If we achieve â?? as we believe it possible to do â?? the eradication of poverty and hunger, the promotion of social and economic development, the protection of the rights of all, gender equality, the empowerment of women, a reversal of climate change, access to quality services and the provision of special attention to vulnerable groups, then we will see a positive evolution in the living conditions within our nations. Let us therefore all work to that end. In that regard, we highlight the efforts of the African Union, enshrined in the guidelines of the important and ambitious Agenda 2063. Its implementation and success will contribute greatly to making such objectives more easily reachable. It is without a doubt an inclusive document, based on the cultural specificities of each country, which consciously demand from our Governments a very clear commitment to its success. However successful we may be in achieving the goals of peace, stability and progress on a world scale, none of it will make any sense if we do not know how to take care of our planet. Combating the phenomenon of climate change is perhaps the most complex objective requiring all humankind to participate. The success of this fight is perhaps the greatest legacy we can leave to future generations. In that context, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a historic, broad-based consensus on the challenges we face in that area and the financial and technological means to overcome them. However, the measures proposed have yet to be implemented. Every day we further postpone the issue, the more our planet suffers. Increasingly extreme weather events cause irreparable damage to our ecosystem and life on Earth. I therefore appeal, without prejudice, for the the members of the Assembly to demonstrate political boldness, in the understanding that each should contribute according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Sao Tome and Principe, a small island developing State, has spared no effort in that regard, and I want to assure those present of our firm commitment to being at the forefront of implementing climate-change mitigation measures. However, I note, along with many other speakers, that funding for such measures lacks the support of the international community. Cooperation agreements should be established with ambitious funding for climate issues and guarantees for the effective and efficient transfer of technology by the more developed countries. As those present know, our economy is extremely vulnerable, as it depends on official development assistance to meet almost 90 per cent of its needs. In the context of international financial containment, it becomes necessary to consider and design alternative ways of addressing that complex situation. It was with that in mind that the current Government of Sao Tome and Principe decided to implement an ambitious agenda of transformation for the 2030 horizon. It is fundamentally aimed at changing the paradigm of growth and economic and social development policies, with a strategic focus on the private sector of our economy. The new strategic direction, as reflected in its guidelines, is in perfect harmony with the aspirations of both the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063. We believe in its success and have the necessary ambition, but we will not be able to achieve it without the strong support of our traditional partners and the international community. In that regard, I would like to remind the Assembly that, based on the recognition of the One China principle, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe re-established diplomatic ties with the Peopleâ??s Republic of China late last year. We are certain that this decision will help to strengthen our strategic partnership, and we hope that China will accompany us on the difficult path to development that we have proposed with our transformation agenda 2030. In addition, we support the development efforts of Cubaâ??s friendly population and wish to reiterate our call for further efforts to normalize its relations with the United States of America so that it will act as soon as possible to lift the embargo that for decades has been an obstacle to Cubaâ??s progress. In an era of proliferating technological means at the disposal of humankind, our increasingly attentive and informed societies demand a renewed effort to accomplish the noble mission of our Organization. Let us therefore seek inspiration in its founding principles, the quest for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, humanitarian support for all those in need, the promotion of inclusive and constructive dialogue, the protection of our ecosystem and the promotion and guarantee of human rights, which are vital for the harmonious development of our nations. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe will continue to fight for such ideals, joining forces and willpower for its materialization.",1,196
7862,Session 72 - 2017,SUR_72_2017.txt,SUR_72_2017,72,2017,SUR,"On behalf of His Excellency Mr. DesirÃ© Delano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname, I wish to extend our congratulations to Mr. LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to preside over the General Assembly. Suriname is grateful to the former President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his efforts in addressing the issues of small and vulnerable States within the small island developing States construct, and we wish him success in his new role as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Oceans. Allow me to address critical issues related to the theme of this yearâ??s session that are directly related to Suriname and the region we belong to. Suriname cannot but give special attention to the extraordinary fashion in which the annual hurricane season has presented itself in the Caribbean. Our thoughts go out to the many families, mothers and children, the elderly and the sick who are living the worst possible nightmare. We are convinced that those affected will be comforted by the hope that all is not lost, since the world community stands with them and prays for the betterment and speedy recovery of our region. We also acknowledge the suffering in Mexico as a result of the recent heavy earthquakes and express our deep sympathy for its victims. Those events confront us with the relativity of human power and State power, whether unilateral or multilateral. A quick review of the damage caused by the recent natural disasters shows the destruction of the means of production and physical infrastructure. That has created social disruption that goes far beyond the immediate needs of the victimized societies. We also observe that the world at large demonstrates a strong sense of solidarity when calamity strikes and humanitarian assistance is urgently needed. However, to alleviate the desperate condition of the peoples, we must, in our international efforts, address the calamities from a deeper and wider perspective. We must assist the respective Governments in restructuring socioeconomic and physical infrastructure in such a way that those States can become more resilient and reduce their vulnerability in future. That will require the development of innovative concepts and intensive sharing of global experiences. Combining forces on the global scale has become crucial. Furthermore, it will imply aggressive mobilization of adequate resources. Such necessary resource mobilization will face obstacles. We will have to confront the fact that a number of the more affluent nations entertain inward- looking policies that do not augur well regarding the pressing need to join hands in solving such truly global problems. Recent weeks have made it very clear to all of us that the forces of nature do not discriminate. Suriname strongly supports the view that nations should proportionately contribute at a global level if we want to survive as humankind. When scientists indicate precise and foreseeable natural disasters, it is obvious that we should take precautionary measures, mitigate possible dangers and adapt existing structures to minimize the effect. Becoming more resilient remains the only way. In that connection, it is unacceptable that Caribbean countries, including Suriname, are being graduated to middle-income countries, with zero option to obtain concessional loans. Today, I, too lament the fact that the vulnerability of those countries should be taken into account when classifications are applied. Thus, it is ironic that Suriname is facing such threats of climate change, while at the same time we are making tremendous contributions to mitigate climate change. As a high- forested, low-deforestation country with 90 per cent forest cover â?? the highest in the world â?? Suriname provides regulation services to the global climate, including as a carbon sink. In addition to providing livelihoods to indigenous and tribal communities, our forests are biodiversity hotspots with an impressive number of endemic and internationally significant species. Our forests also support freshwater regulation as part of the unique Amazon ecosystem and provide employment and income generation through an active forest industry. Above all, we have set aside for conservation purposes 1.6 million hectares of pristine rainforest, referred to as the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, as a gift to humankind. While Surinameâ??s greenhouse-gas emissions have historically been negative, it is a challenge to enhance the countryâ??s economic development while maintaining that unique position in the world. To achieve that goal, Suriname is ready to partner with Governments, the global community and other stakeholders to transform our economy into one in which environmental protection â?? including through the REDD+ programme for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries â?? social advancement and economic prosperity take central stage. Our multi-annual development plan, recently adopted by Parliament, is testimony to that vision for our nationâ??s sustainable development. On the issues of non-interference and non-intervention, I draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to the following. The natural disasters I just referred to coincide with growing political conflicts, and that may well lead to a serious loss of human lives and the destruction of human achievements. A number of those conflicts are related to a stark disrespect for the basic principles that have been enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations since 1945. Non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States and non-intervention are not empty principles. They are based on a firm belief that all peoples are equal and that the prevailing structures of government and democracy cannot be prescribed externally. Recent interventions in the Middle East have not created better societies. On the contrary, we have witnessed divided, warring factions that can hardly be qualified as an improvement to the Governments that were ousted. Suriname also has experienced the ill effects of interference in internal affairs. The destruction of infrastructure and means of production amounted to approximately $300 million, and much worse than that is the fact that hundreds of children were deprived of access to education and proper health care. Today as a nation we are still suffering from the results of the so- called foreign-supported internal strife that disrupted societies in the interior that were characterized by a socioeconomic order that had lasted for more than 300 years. Suriname knows what interference means, and the only way we have dealt with it is by insisting on dialogue, which resulted in the signing of the peace treaty in May 1992. So when we tell the world that non-interference and non-intervention are principles to adhere to at all costs, we are speaking from our own experience. For almost three decades, Surinameâ??s commitment to peace and development through the promotion of dialogue and the implementation of broad-based social programmes remained in full accordance with the principles and guidelines of the United Nations. Dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect has led to peace and prosperity. In that same vein, in 2012 the legislature passed an amendment to the amnesty law of 1992 that applied amnesty for the full period of political violence in Suriname, from 1980 to 1992. In doing so, the legislature complied with article 8 of the Constitution, which bans discrimination and guarantees equal rights to all citizens. That amendment further provided for the truth and reconciliation commission, allowing for a clear distinction between politically motivated violence and criminal acts. Allow me to inform this gathering that Surinameâ??s path to peace and sustainable development enjoyed full acceptance in 2015, when a greater majority elected the incumbent Government. Moreover, civil society has taken up the responsibility to advance the peace process through the implementation of initiatives that contribute to the cause of truth-finding and reconciliation. Against the backdrop of those developments, Suriname took note with concern of the unverified and biased comments published by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. Therefore, Suriname categorically rejects the assertions of that special procedures mandate-holder, who did not provide the Government an opportunity to respond in a timely manner. The seventy-first session of the General Assembly marked a milestone in the way the world views the five-decades-old unilateral economic, commercial and financial boycott against Cuba. Last year, not one State voted against resolution 71/5, on definitively ending that unilateral decision, which has proved to be unproductive from all angles. However, the current reality obliges us to continue expressing our deepest concern, since we learned about the continuation of that detrimental and unilateral policy. Suriname therefore, with absolute respect for the sovereignty of each nation to determine its own policies, urges that constructive dialogue and cooperation must prevail and that bridges must be built on the basis of equality and respect for independence and sovereignty. Suriname rejects any measure that might strengthen the blockade, which is in violation of international law, the sovereignty of States, the principles of non-intervention in internal affairs and self-determination. My Government reiterates the critical importance of those principles and underscores the relevance of the processes of dialogue, diplomacy, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and political and economic cooperation as building blocks for stability, peace and democracy in the Americas. In that line of thought, we encourage the Member States in general, and especially the South American and Caribbean States, to deal in a constructive manner with the problems of our sister nation, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Let us continue to stress the need for dialogue between all parties. History proves that interference and intervention are never successful. Suriname is deeply concerned about the current developments on the Korean peninsula. In whatever configuration for a sustainable solution, we believe that the interests of the Korean people must remain paramount. First and foremost, the Korean people must be given guarantees that violence, whether it originates in North Korea or elsewhere, can never be a solution to the problem. Dialogue and negotiations will be the only remaining road to a sustainable solution for the dignity and well-being of the Korean people in their struggle for peace and development. The example of South America and the Caribbean in remaining a nuclear-weapon-free zone could well serve as a model to be followed. The absence of nuclear weapons creates an environment conducive to dialogue and meaningful negotiations. The global village is becoming ever more interdependent. Different cultures and ethnic orientations are rapidly becoming the basis for racial and global conflicts. Therefore, we have to find new paradigms to effectively limit dogmatic adherence to religious and social concepts. Tolerance and mutual respect have become a must if we want to guarantee peace and sustainability for future generations. The Government of Suriname is following, not only with keen interest but also a certain degree of concern, the recent re-emergence in many parts of the world of right-wing extremism framed as populism. That development has the potential to put severe pressure on social cohesion within countries and bilateral relations between nations, thereby affecting opportunities and the potential for cooperation. Suriname has worked tirelessly to achieve national unity, which has resulted in a very diverse and well- integrated society where tolerance forms one of the basic principles that underpins its very existence. Thanks to the type of nation we have built, very disturbing and destabilizing factors such as right-wing extremism and ethnic and religious intolerance can neither have nor find a place in our nation, nor will they ever be able to take root and grow. Today, Suriname enjoys an exceptional era of tolerance and mutual respect, with Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims and other religious denominations living in an atmosphere of peace and mutual respect. With roots from all continents of the world and through intensive dialogue and mutual respect, Suriname has become a shining example of the importance of not entertaining supremacist concepts. Therefore, the Government of Suriname is considered best positioned to understand and analyse the current global trend, which needs to be reversed with immediate effect. Suriname stands ready to share its experience and best practices with other sister nations on the issue of nation-building based on diversity, pluralism, integration and peace. I am convinced that others will then be able to better understand one of the important mottos of Suriname â?? diversity is power. My Government strongly believes that focusing on people is the quintessence of the application of power. Suriname is an example in kind. As a nation, we have recently faced the ill effects of a largely commodity- based export economy. The sharp downturn in oil and gold prices in recent years, combined with the unfortunate closure of the century-old bauxite and alumina complex, has challenged Surinameâ??s macroeconomic management since mid-2015. By any international standards, Suriname faced a severe shock that was compounded on the balance-of- payments side by the sharp increase in imports related to two major investment projects in oil and gold mining, which together accounted for about 35 per cent of annual gross domestic product. We estimate that the economy contracted severely, by more than 10 per cent, in 2016, requiring unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy adjustments, and some temporary balance-of- payments support. In order to stabilize the exchange rate, reduce domestic demand and re-establish a viable balance of payments position, the monetary authorities sharply curtailed credit creation in the country, with credit to the private sector contracting in nominal terms. Since October 2016, the exchange rate has stabilized, monthly inflation rates have fallen to less than 1 per cent and the country has returned to a current account surplus position. Our macroeconomic response to the external and fiscal pressures started in earnest in August 2015 with a massive contraction in Government expenditure and increases in taxation. The Government acknowledges that the extractive sector producing gold, fossil fuels and other marketable minerals will remain critical for our economic development in the foreseeable future. We accept that reality, being fully aware that the wealth created must be deployed in financing a well-planned initiative to expand our economy in a sustainable manner. With that objective in mind, the Government has recently adopted very important legislative measures. One deals with the establishment of a sovereign wealth and stabilization fund, and the other introduces the institutional framework which will facilitate foreign direct investments. As outlined in our multi-annual development plan, Suriname intends to strike a balance between the export of commodities and the export of final products in sync with the services industry. Suriname acknowledges its citizens as the most important resource for its development. In spite of the challenging budgetary constraints, the socioeconomic policies of the Government remained people-oriented. The continued application of the basic health-care law provides for proper health care for our entire population. In addition, as announced by President Bouterse and as part of the social contract, adequate housing, access to education, youth participation, engagement and sports development, job creation and care for persons with disabilities and the elderly have remained priorities for sustainable development and growth. The message delivered by Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres assured us all of his commitment to the theme of the Assemblyâ??s seventy-second session. Suriname pledges its full support and cooperation. The implementation of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in sync with the necessary reform of the United Nations, will carry a lot of weight. That will be a formidable challenge, and therefore my Government believes that in addition to the mobilization domestic resources, consideration must be given to accessible financing, from a wide array of financial mechanisms, for development, capacity- building, innovation and the transfer of technology for developing countries. Having addressed those matters of vital importance for the survival of humankind, on the basis of the principles of the United Nations, we bring to mind the Amerindian saying that we have not inherited the Earth, but that we have the Earth on loan from future generations. It is up to us to give that wise saying its substance. In the final analysis, I wish to underscore and reiterate the utmost importance of youth involvement and participation at the highest levels. My Government has made it a priority to create the conditions for youth to be part of decision-making processes. I refer to young people, among others, as innovators, members of parliament and cabinet and as chief executive officers within what we refer to as the youth-adult partnership. In 2010, our Government established a special ministry responsible for youth and sport development. It gives me pleasure to announce that this year youth representatives are part of my official delegation to this seventy-second session. Furthermore, it is through political will that more women in our society can accede to the highest echelons of political decision-making. The 2030 Agenda envisages a world that guarantees all inhabitants of our planet a climate conducive to self- development, a climate of respect for human dignity and of tolerance towards other cultures, with the ultimate goal of giving our planet the gift of diversity based on mutual respect. It is up to each one of us, regardless of our status in society; it is up to each nation, whether big or small; it is up to this multilateral Organization to focus on people and strive for peace and a decent live for all on a sustainable planet. We owe it to ourselves; yes, we owe it to this and coming generations.",1,196
7863,Session 72 - 2017,SVK_72_2017.txt,SVK_72_2017,72,2017,SVK,"First, allow me to extend my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency. I am convinced that under your leadership the General Assembly will swiftly and successfully advance its work. Every minute, as I speak, 12 children die of hunger, and more than 100 are born to extreme poverty. Dozens die from preventable diseases, which we have been able to cure for decades, and it is our responsibility â?? that of the people in this Hall â?? to do everything in our powers to help them. The challenges that we face often do not require difficult strategies or unprecedented amounts of money. They require only our dedication and true leadership, which includes both sides: those who can help give up on ignorance and selfishness and those who receive the help to make the people their first priority. I therefore want to commend you, Sir, for choosing such a sound focus for this yearâ??s session of the General Assembly, namely, on our people and striving for peace and a decent life for all in sustainable conditions. Indeed, there is no bigger responsibility of us as political leaders than to take care of the planet and serve its people. Building safe, healthy, prosperous and just societies for every individual is not a mere ambition. It is our duty. It is the reason that our people entrust us with the power to act on their behalf and to make use of the limited resources that our societies generate. Our devotion to shared principles, virtuous ambition to keep promises and ability to deliver results are the three most vital components of all respectable public service, and there are no stronger enemies to the effort to make a real difference in the world than egoism, ignorance and narrow-minded national or personal interests. Respect for the principles of peace and security is essential to living in dignity for all our people. Those principles have been at the very core of the Organization since its establishment. The first and the most important responsibility for us as leaders and Members of the United Nations is to adhere to those principles and values, enforce them and punish those who violate them. Yet far too many people are dying in senseless conflicts or suffering in displacement as a result of the violence. The enormous human tragedies, the material damage caused by armed conflicts, and the refugee crisis deplete much-needed resources that could otherwise go to social and economic development. The bloody reality of our times is a painful reminder of our ignorance and egoism. Every year after this gathering, we all return to our homes. But there are more than 60 million people who have no such place â?? people who had to leave everything behind to save their lives and run away from poverty or the horrors of war. Those people do not ask too much. They just want to have a place to live, to raise children, to prosper with their loved ones. We need to make those people feel at home again. The way we treat our own people is as important to international peace and security as the way we treat each other. Recent findings about the use of chemical weapons by the Al-Assad regime in Syria against his own citizens should alarm us all as much as the atrocities in Raqqa, Mosul and many other places. All such horrors demonstrate how little respect is being paid to human lives and to the very principle of humanity, especially when power games are played. Our resolve to act when United Nations principles are at stake is often the last hope for those who desperately wait for our help, trapped in the middle of deadly violence in the ruins of what they used to call their homes. We are witness to short-sighted interests built on spreading instability that are undermining collective efforts to secure peace and security. The very core of the Charter of the United Nations for securing peaceful coexistence among nations is crippled in the name of the selfish pursuits and egoism of the so-called spheres of influence â?? a fancy phrase too often misused to cover violations of the international order and justify disrespect for sovereignty. It is a dangerous game of tragic outcomes and unintended consequences. We in Europe can see it too: Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova all know the price of peace. They are all aware of the pain resulting from their sovereignty being undermined by an aggressive neighbour â?? a neighbour that thinks the rules do not apply to it. We should therefore not be surprised when things get out of control and cause enormous and irreparable damage to people, to countries and to this planet. Today we face one of the worst threats to international peace and security in recent history: North Korea openly threatens our world with nuclear weapons. Such grave disrespect for human life cannot be tolerated. I strongly call on the North Korean regime to terminate its development of weapons of mass destruction and to return to the path of dialogue and building peace on the Korean peninsula. We need collective resolve in the very spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. The Organization must be firm in its principles and stand for the purpose for which it was created. Some of us have a special responsibility to do so on a regional or international level. There is no room for geopolitical games or economic gains at the expense of our common security. Millions of human lives at stake. We live in the most prosperous time in the history of humankind. We have all the tools and enough resources to help every human being on this planet live a life in dignity, free from fear or hunger. But there is one challenge that will test all the limits of our ability to lead, act together, adapt and reinvent our societies and the way we live our lives. We are beginning to see and feel the sinister consequences of our actions on the environment. Be it 100-year floods taking place with high frequency, hurricanes that strike harder than before, or devastating droughts that force people to abandon their homes, such disasters are not warnings of future climate change; they are powerful natural events are features of the new environment we live in now. Last yearâ??s adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was an unprecedented demonstration of collective will to address the challenges arising from the climate change our societies must face. It may be remembered as a unique effort of the present generation of humankind to mitigate the consequences of our impact on the environment. It may become our ultimate legacy: a chance for our children to adapt and live happily and safely again in the changed environment. Our devotion to common principles, our virtue in keeping our promises and our ability to deliver results on this issue is more crucial than ever. No money or short- term economic interests could possibly compensate for the irreparable damage if we fail to act together and change our irresponsible behaviour. The price of such planetary ignorance will be much higher than any we have ever paid. Slovakia understands the urgency for collective action. We pushed for the swift ratification of the Paris Agreement under our presidency of the European Union last year. I confirm today that we will implement all the national measures necessary to fulfil our obligations, because the Paris Agreement must be implemented in full. The Organization has served us well for decades. It has faced tough challenges â?? it excelled in some, it may have failed in others, but it has been the best we have had, with countless successes and well-deserved global authority. There are many pressing issues in todayâ??s world that had not been foreseen when the United Nations was created. Who would have imagined that one of the most important topics on the United Nations agenda would be climate change? And yet we demonstrate that we can tackle such challenges. But it would be naive to think that just by applying the same old procedures we can achieve new results and address any new and unforeseen troubles. Just like any other organization, we need to adapt to changes. I strongly believe that we are capable of such adaptation. However, let me emphatically underline that, while we strive for reform to be more efficient, the very core of the United Nations must be respected without exception. In order to succeed, all of us will be required to be responsible leaders. We must give up on national egoism and ignorance. We must stand true to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and be honest with each other by keeping the promises that we make and delivering results, both in words and in deeds. That is because there is no more noble task for us than to serve our people and strive to allow them to live in peace, dignity and prosperity.",1,196
7864,Session 72 - 2017,SVN_72_2017.txt,SVN_72_2017,72,2017,SVN,"At the outset, I would like to express our sympathies to Mexico and its people as they grapple with the effects of the earthquake that has resulted in so many tragic victims and ruined homes. I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to wish him every success in discharging his duties. He can count on Sloveniaâ??s full support. I would also like to to express my gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his important contribution to the work of the General Assembly over the past year. Lastly, I would also like to congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as Secretary-General. I commend his determination to promote the United Nations and its values and goals, and his tireless efforts to strengthen the Organization. The world continues to deal with challenges to international peace and security that are ever more complex and intertwined. Shocking images of human suffering are a daily reality, the consequences of the armed conflicts, environmental degradation, famine, lack of economic opportunity, grave breaches of human rights and terrorism that are just some of those global challenges. If we are to address them, effective international cooperation, with the United Nations at its core, is essential. We have the mandate and the responsibility to act. We must stand united to address global challenges together. Despite those threats, I am encouraged by a new dynamic in the United Nations and the strong push by the Secretary-General to strengthen multilateralism and the reform agenda. I commend his determination to make the Organization stronger and more fit to serve as the bedrock of the international rules-based order. More than ever, we need a strong United Nations to be one of our key actors in providing security, stability and a life of dignity for all. Two years ago, we achieved a milestone by agreeing on our development road map. Together, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Change Agreement provide a framework and vision for a more sustainable planet in the future and prosperity for all. The true test now is their implementation. This is not the time to go back on our promises. Rather, we need to turn them into real progress that will benefit people around the globe. Slovenia has embarked on that path with a sense of urgency. That is demonstrated, among other things, by Sloveniaâ??s high ranking in the SDG Index and Dashboards 2017 Report, which shows that we are in the top 10 of 157 measured countries in our achievements towards the Sustainable Development Goals. We are strongly engaged in protecting the environment and ensuring its sustainability, and we are determined to raise awareness about the key factors shaping our sustainable future. For example, we recognize the key role that bees and other pollinators play in preventing hunger, ensuring food security, improving human health and preserving the environment and its biodiversity. In that context, we are proposing that the General Assembly declare 20 May an international day of bees and proclaim it World Bee Day. I would like to thank all of the States that have already expressed support for the initiative and encourage others to do so. Achieving sustainable development is only possible if the global community works together in a solid partnership between Governments, international organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector. The same is true for dealing with large global migrations and refugee flows. Shared responsibility and solidarity should be the guiding principles of our global approach. In that spirit, Slovenia is constructively engaged in the consultation process for the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and the global compact on refugees. We believe that the adoption in 2018 of both global compacts will be another major milestone in our path towards ensuring a life of dignity for all. Without respect for human rights, there can be no peace, freedom, security or development. The United Nations has been instrumental in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. However, let us not forget that the primary responsibility for the fulfilment of human rights lies with States. Slovenia, as a current member of the Human Rights Council, is a strong supporter of human rights. In that spirit, we continue to advocate a progressive approach to human rights issues, enhancing protection norms and standards at all levels. Our main focus is on the rights of children, support for gender equality and the empowerment of women, as well as the rights of the elderly. In that context, we also focus on the importance of intergenerational collaboration. There is still much to be done before we can ensure a life of dignity for all without discrimination. More must also be done to mitigate harm to civilians, especially in the context of armed conflicts, and to prevent all forms of sexual violence. It is particularly despicable when people deployed to protect civilians engage in abuse. We therefore underline the need for a zero-tolerance policy on all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. Respect for international treaties, the decisions of international courts and tribunals and other sources of international law, as well as the ability to implement them, is indispensable to a functioning global community. Respect for the obligations arising from treaties and for other sources of international law is also embedded in the Charter of the United Nations, and is the very foundation of international peace and security. Moreover, it is an important guarantor of friendly relations and cooperation among States. Slovenia recognizes the essential role of the rule of law and international law and has therefore made it central to its foreign policy. In the context of the rule of law, ending impunity for the most serious international crimes continues to be an important goal for my Government. Slovenia is committed to promoting international criminal justice, especially as it is represented by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The principles enshrined in the Charter attest to the natural partnership between the United Nations and the Court, and that relationship is expected to advance even further with the activation of the ICCâ??s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which is anticipated by the end of the year. We express our strong support for swift activation of the Kampala amendments on the crime of aggression. Needless to say, the primary responsibility to prosecute atrocity crimes still rests with States. Slovenia, together with other leading States, will continue to actively pursue the improvement of the international legal framework for mutual legal assistance and extradition for domestic prosecution of the most serious international crimes. Years of horrific war in Syria, conflicts in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Mali and dire situations such as those in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to name just a few, remain particular sources of concern. We call on all relevant parties to refrain from the use of force and engage in political dialogue. Violent extremism and the crimes committed by terrorist groups continue to plague the world. We must do all we can to prevent and stop such crimes, particularly by providing viable alternative opportunities for young people. The United Nations plays a key role in countering terrorism, including the prevention of violent extremism. In that regard, Slovenia welcomed the reform of the United Nations counter-terrorism architecture, as well as resolution 71/291, designed to strengthen the ability of the United Nations system to assist Member States in implementing the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy. As a strong supporter of non-proliferation and disarmament in the area of weapons of mass destruction, Slovenia is committed to treaty-based nuclear disarmament and arms control. We firmly believe that we must work progressively to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons through full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In that regard, we strongly condemn the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Koreaâ??s violations of Security Council resolutions and its own international commitments. They pose a serious threat to peace and security in the region and beyond. We must intensify our efforts to sustain peace everywhere, but most immediately in a wide range of fragile and conflict- affected States. Conflicts cannot be prevented or resolved by addressing the symptoms alone; we must address the underlying causes. For that we have to think long term. The United Nations can help to defuse latent conflicts. Whenever possible, we should opt for diplomacy, mediation and conflict prevention. The emphasis must be on doing more in a collective, timely and effective manner. That can be achieved only by a strong, robust, adaptable, knowledgeable and responsible United Nations, which is why Slovenia strongly supports the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform efforts. The various parts of the United Nations system must be better coordinated. Duplication must be avoided, and the common goal must be getting tangible results. I would like to conclude by assuring the Assembly that Slovenia is committed to supporting the United Nations and is determined to work with all partners to deliver tangible, meaningful results that will advance peace, security, development and human rights for all.",1,196
7865,Session 72 - 2017,SWE_72_2017.txt,SWE_72_2017,72,2017,SWE,"In 1954, former Secretary-General Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld stated that the United Nations was not created to bring us to heaven, but to save us from hell. The need for a United Nations that seeks to save us from humankindâ??s worst impulses remains. However, in these days of uncertainty, we must also learn from and build on what is positive in our world and the United Nations. In his important address on Tuesday (see A/72/PV.3), our Secretary-General laid out the threats and challenges that we face and how we can overcome them. Delivering a peaceful and prosperous future will depend on collective action. This is the moment for multilateralism, not unilateralism. We must grasp it or risk the consequences. The United Nations is at the centre of that effort. It is a tailor-made space for the world to find solutions to the common challenges of our time. Despite the sometimes justified criticisms, it is clear that we still believe in the power of the United Nations. If we did not, Presidents, Prime Ministers and business and civil-society leaders would not be here this week. I believe that we all recognize that, in the face of global challenges, going it alone is no longer an option. The United Nations, founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote better standards of life in larger freedom, has prevented a repetition of the catastrophic wars that preceded its founding. Extreme poverty has fallen to a historic low. Life expectancy continues to climb. Millions of people are reached every year with life-saving humanitarian assistance. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the sustaining peace agenda are powerful illustrations of what we can achieve together. Those agreements are the strategies for our common future. We must now ensure that the Organization has the structure and the tools needed to support countries to deliver them. The broad support for the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform agenda illustrates the importance that we attach to an effective United Nations, its role at the centre of multilateralism and as a platform for the delivery of our common commitments. The scope of the reforms being proposed by the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General reveals the complex tasks at hand. The peace and security architecture must better prevent conflicts and sustain peace. The United Nations development system must be radically reoriented to achieve the 2030 Agenda. Moreover, to deliver those changes, modern management skills and systems will be essential. More importantly, we must recognize that those reforms cannot be pursued in isolation from one another. People do not experience life in pieces â?? their needs must be central. Peace and security, economic and social development and the protection and promotion of human rights are mutually reinforcing. As a response, all pillars of the United Nations system and our own bilateral efforts must also be interlinked and mutually reinforcing. That calls for new ways of working and thinking. Sweden fully subscribes to the principles for reform that were articulated by the Secretary-General: a country- level and people-centred perspective, gender parity, decentralized responsibility and decision-making, and reformed budget procedures. Secretary-General Guterres and Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed have our full support in their efforts. On our part, we, as Member States, have a responsibility to act coherently, avoid micromanagement and ensure long-term, stable and adequate financing. More flexible funding is necessary. We firmly believe in core and unearmarked funding. We cannot allow ourselves to cherry pick to accommodate domestic interests; that will not give the Organization the stability it needs. I am proud to say that Sweden will increase its development cooperation budget by approximately $350 million in 2018, bringing our budget to its highest-ever level and delivering on our commitment to devote 1 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance. In addition to words, we will support the Secretary-Generalâ??s efforts with kronor by making available additional flexible funding for reform. In the immediate term, faced with record levels of humanitarian need, the humanitarian system requires urgent funding to save lives and end suffering. In the longer term, investing in the 2030 Agenda and the sustaining peace agenda will build resilience. Let me focus now on three particular areas in the remainder of my remarks. First, nine months ago, Sweden joined the Security Council. As the General Assembly elected us to the Council, it is only proper that I report back to its members on what we have been doing on their behalf. Our approach to the Council is simple. While we each come with our own national perspective and will not always agree, as Council members we are bound together by a responsibility to the Charter of the United Nations and the world. To that end, Sweden works with all members to deliver meaningful outcomes from the Councilâ??s discussions. We work closely with the other elected members, which represent the broader membership and bring important perspectives. We are also talking with many members of the Assembly as part of our commitment to speaking with countries on the Councilâ??s agenda, not only about them. Delivering real outcomes for those who need them is a responsibility that goes beyond our national interests. Needs are growing. The number of major conflicts is on the rise. However, as the Secretary-General has said, neither war nor peace is inevitable; they result from the choices that we make. Many of the conflicts on the Councilâ??s agenda have come about not because we failed to see them coming â?? the signs were there â?? but because we failed to respond early or quickly enough. Moreover, prevention means not only choosing to heed the warnings when they come, but investing in peaceful societies to avoid the causes of conflicts emerging in the first place. As leaders within our communities and as national leaders, we must choose peace, invest in peace and deliver peace. The United Nations system must be configured to support us. Sweden has made conflict prevention a central pillar of our Council membership. We have underscored the need for the Council to recognize the primacy of politics in peacekeeping mandates and the need for long-term political strategies that aim to prevent conflict and sustain peace by addressing root causes. I believe we are making progress. That is evidenced by the Councilâ??s support for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Gambia, for the peace process in Colombia and for the transitions in Liberia and CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, as well as its cooperation with the African Union to bring stability to Somalia. As Chair of the Councilâ??s Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, Sweden has sought to strengthen the protection of children in conflict zones. The protection of children today prevents conflicts tomorrow. Nonetheless, we have to do more. The situation in Myanmar is a haunting example of where the root causes of conflict went unresolved, with tragic consequences. It is now urgent that the violence end and that the population be protected, human rights respected and a dignified return allowed. Humanitarian access is essential. Sweden supports the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. We urge the Myanmar Government to implement those recommendations without delay. In Syria, prevention also failed. The price paid by the country and its citizens has been unimaginable and horrific. Sweden will continue to work through the Council for nationwide humanitarian access and a political solution, which is the only option for long- term peace and a better future for Syria. In South Sudan, the civilian population has also borne the brunt of a nearly four-year, devastating conflict. I welcome the recent initiatives of South Sudanâ??s neighbours. I urge the Government and all other parties to increase humanitarian access, lay down their arms and engage in a meaningful process to end the conflict. We continue our long-standing engagement in trying to advance the Middle East peace process. As the Secretary-General said during his recent visit to the region, the two-State solution is the only way forward. Only a negotiated settlement between the parties and an end to the 50 years of occupation can achieve the goal of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. We need to resolve the conflict once and for all. Doing so will have implications for peace that go beyond the Holy Land and the Middle East itself. Perhaps the greatest threat to international peace and security is the unacceptable and repeated provocations of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea in pursuit of a nuclear-weapons programme. We call upon the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to cease further testing, fulfil its international obligations and turn to a path of sincere dialogue on denuclearization. All States must implement the measures that have been decided upon by a united Security Council. Sanctions must be combined with political efforts to pave the way for a peaceful solution. We welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s pledge to make his good offices available to that end. Lasting peace requires the involvement of the entire population, meaning that the full, equal and effective participation of women must be hardwired into all of our efforts towards sustaining peace. That brings me to my second point â?? women and peace and security. As a representative of the worldâ??s first feminist Government, that issue is close to my heart. From speaking with many members of the Assembly, I realize that I am far from alone in my strong conviction that womenâ??s participation in peace and security efforts is essential for sustainable peace. Ensuring womenâ??s participation must be at the centre of the United Nations reform efforts. Sweden is working tirelessly to put the women and peace and security agenda into action in all aspects of the Security Councilâ??s work, from including gender reporting in mission mandates, to adding listing criteria for sexual and gender-based violence in sanctions regimes. Swedenâ??s feminist foreign policy is an agenda for change that is aimed at increasing rights, representation and resources for all women and girls, based on the reality of their lives. We urge all countries to form their own feminist policy and ensure that everyone â?? women, men, boys and girls â?? is treated equally. My third and last point regards our common responsibility for global development. The 2030 Agenda provides the pathways to achieve the peaceful, sustainable and equitable societies we want. All countries â?? rich and poor â?? share the responsibility of turning that promise into a reality for millions of people around the world. It will not be done by Governments alone. All stakeholders from across society have a part to play. Ensuring that the United Nations development system is transformed to support those efforts will be critical. Measuring our progress against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be essential, both for decision-making and accountability. Sweden has developed a set of national goals, linked to the SDGs and our national budget, which we are using to measure the development of our society. As we all know, the strength of the 2030 Agenda is in the inherent interlinkages between all 17 Goals. Each Goal is equally important and interdependent. Nonetheless, I would like to highlight two of those Goals. First, I will address the Goal of reducing inequality. Globalization has opened the world, strengthened economic growth and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. However, we have failed to allocate the benefits of globalization equally. We must do better. As part of our contribution, in 2016 Sweden, together with an initial core group of States, businesses and trade unions, launched the Global Deal for Decent Work and Inclusive Growth. The Global Deal is a partnership developed with the International Labour Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with a focus on enhanced social dialogue and sound industrial relations, which are crucial to reducing inequality. The second Goal I would like to mention is that of healthy oceans and seas. Oceans connect us all. Without water, there is no life. Therefore, the deteriorating condition of our oceans must ring alarm bells for us all. Sweden was pleased to co-host, with Fiji, the Ocean Conference that took place in June. The multi-stakeholder participation and all the commitments made highlighted the fact that saving the oceans will require all sectors of society to play their part, and that they are ready to do so. The oceans are also affected by and, in return, affect our climate. We are already seeing the devastating impact of extreme weather events. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of such events. Left unchecked, climate change will wash away development gains and increase instability and conflict. To the few who still doubt the overwhelming evidence that climate change is real, I ask: are they really willing to take the chance? Especially when we see that new technologies offer the opportunity to simultaneously reduce emissions and grow economies. Sweden is already proving that is possible and has set a goal of zero net greenhouse emissions by 2045. All countries must join the effort to achieve the decisive transformations needed to reduce emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change from happening. With 160 States parties to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change so far, the global commitment remains strong. In his address on Tuesday, the Secretary-General told us that we must act as one, because only together, as united nations, can we fulfil the promise of the Charter of the United Nations and advance human dignity for all. He is right. The expression â??we are all in this togetherâ?? has perhaps never been so apt. As our world becomes more integrated, so do the challenges and threats we face. We cannot go it alone; we must stand together. Multilateralism is the only path to peace and prosperity.",1,196
7866,Session 72 - 2017,SWZ_72_2017.txt,SWZ_72_2017,72,2017,SWZ,"Allow me to express our sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. We commend you for immediately identifying six overarching priorities for your tenure, which touch on attaining peace, giving impetus to the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change commitments, equality and human rights for all, among others. These priorities truly capture several of the current troublesome global challenges and we look forward to working closely with you on these issues. The Kingdom of eSwatini would also like to commend the leadership of the new Secretary-General, who is committed to transforming the United Nations into an Organization fit for the twenty-first century. Reform of the United Nations and its attendant bodies has been under discussion for a long time. My delegation believes that fresh impetus must be given to this process and tangible progress made. We are therefore encouraged by the Secretary-Generalâ??s intention to refocus our attention on the reform agenda. Reform of the Security Council is a key aspect of the process, and no transformation could be complete without its fundamental change. To that end, the Kingdom of eSwatini wishes to reiterate Africaâ??s call for a permanent seat on the Security Council, in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations is urged to listen to the voice of the millions of Africans who want to contribute to the welfare of the global community as equal partners. We are confident that under the able leadership of the Secretary-General, the United Nations will reach greater heights in its support for countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The United Nations staff are also to be congratulated on their remarkable work in supporting inclusive and sustainable development, tackling diseases, promoting peace and stability and creating a conducive environment for humankind to live in, sometimes under extremely inimical conditions. The theme of this session â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? â?? resonates perfectly with the motto of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of leaving no one behind. The theme is indeed cross- cutting in nature, as it affects every aspect of life. It calls on all of us to work to create peaceful countries, continents and a sustainable world in which people can lead peaceful and prosperous lives. In that regard, we wish to urge Member States to join hands in addressing the issue of nuclear threats, which have the potential to disrupt world peace. No country has the right to make the world an unsafe place to live in, and we owe it to our people and future generations to put a stop to nuclear threats. Terrorism remains a threat to the safety of our peoples in various parts of the world. It is a setback to key development issues that deserve the priority attention of the United Nations. The Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to peace and a decent life for all. We are also firm believers in the principle of consultative decision-making, which is a transparent and all-inclusive undertaking and grants all citizens an opportunity to voice their views so as to constructively contribute to our countryâ??s social, economic, cultural and political development. We are committed to the SDGs, as they provide a development framework within which the global community is able to strive for the inclusive and sustainable development of its respective countries. We have taken several initiatives to mainstream and localize the SDGs through public-awareness campaigns, consultations, education and training at all levels. The Kingdom of eSwatini has also integrated the Goals into its national development strategy, which has been revised to ensure that it is linked to the SDGs and the African Unionâ??s Agenda 2063. Appropriate institutional arrangements are now in place for properly monitoring the implementation of the Goals at all levels. Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. That urgency is now a global reality, and recent weather episodes around the world, such as hurricanes, floods and mudslides, have shown that no nation is immune to its effects. The Kingdom of eSwatini is no exception. In 2015 and 2016, the southern African countries, including our Kingdom, faced a severe drought. Its devastating effects, aggravated by the fall armyworm, adversely affected crop production. Funds from other projects and activities were diverted to mitigate the challenges. The scale of the drought led the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region to declare it a natural disaster. We are grateful to the United Nations, our development partners, the international community, non-governmental organizations and other local organizations for supporting us during that period. The Government will continue its programme of farming input subsidies for our farmers, and developing adequate water-harvesting infrastructure to enhance food sufficiency will always remain one of our top priorities. We urge donors and all nations not only to fulfil their pledges to the Green Fund but also to adopt policies that strike a correct balance between the production of essential products and the environmental sustainability we need to protect and preserve the world for future generations. The net enrolment ratio in primary schools in the Kingdom increased significantly from 79.2 per cent in 2000 to 97.7 per cent in 2015, in a reflection of my countryâ??s efforts to ensure that all children have access to education, irrespective of their socioeconomic status. The Government is also providing for our childrenâ??s needs by placing greater focus on assisting those who are orphaned and vulnerable through various programmes that ensure that they too can access free primary-school education and have adequate nutrition through school feeding schemes. In our quest to achieve a decent life for all, and in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africaâ??s Agenda 2063, the Kingdom of eSwatini has put in place several all-inclusive initiatives that are aimed at ensuring that no one is left behind. The Government also provides grants to the elderly as a way of supplementing their livelihoods. The Kingdom is also developing innovation parks that will equip our young people with creative skills that can enable them to contribute to the countryâ??s sustainable development. We would like to forge partnerships with well-established international parks to leverage and learn from their experience, and we have urged our private sector to take advantage of that initiative. We believe that together with many others, this initiative will help to nurture a future generation that is skilled and well equipped to provide solutions to the socioeconomic challenges and youth unemployment that our nation is facing. The Kingdom of eSwatini will host the SADC University of Innovation and Technology, which is expected to produce highly skilled manpower and provide solutions for transforming economies, thereby enabling countries in the SADC region to close their skills gap. We are seeking the support of highly educated facilitators and the international community to make that project a reality. Tackling poverty, hunger and the disease burden and improving our peopleâ??s basic standards of living have been at the centre of our Vision 2022 and national development strategy. The importance of human capital investment and promoting the interests of vulnerable groups represent crucial steps towards economic growth and prosperity. I have full confidence in our innovative and educated workforce, which has demonstrated an indomitable spirit and resilience in overcoming the severe social, economic and environmental challenges of recent times. As a result, our national guiding theme for 2017 is â??Rising above adversity to create prosperity for allâ??. The critical importance of the demographic dividend to Africaâ??s transformative development has been acknowledged by African leaders. They have recognized the urgent need to accelerate the implementation of the African Union Roadmap on Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth. The HIV and AIDS pandemic remains one of our priority areas, as it continues to undermine our sustainable development objectives. It is stretching our health resources to the limit and calls for collective action on the part of the Government, international donors and other stakeholders to address it. As a nation, we have decided to work to reach AIDS-free status by 2022, a vision in line with Sustainable Development Goal 3, ending AIDS by 2030. We are pleased to be able to inform the Assembly of the positive results we have attained through our concerted policies in tackling this scourge. Key findings from Swazilandâ??s second HIV incidence measurement survey show that we have achieved a more than 70 per cent viral load suppression among adults living with HIV. We also reduced HIV incidence by nearly half 17-29407 11/29 between 2011 and 2016, a major achievement. While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to do everything in our ability to ensure that there are no new infections. We are also pleased to mention that our efforts to tackle malaria eradication are being recognized. We were honoured that during the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa in January, Africaâ??s Heads of State and Government elected us Chair of the African Leadersâ?? Malaria Alliance. Tomorrow we will hold a side event on malaria here at United Nations Headquarters. Malaria is a scourge that requires our concerted efforts to eradicate from the face of the Earth. We aim to partner with our private sector in Africa and beyond to mobilize resources to combat it. We appreciate our partnersâ?? support and also appeal to financial institutions, development partners and donors to join us in this fight, since it will pay handsome dividends for the people of our beloved African continent. Among the political issues that have continued unresolved for too long is the denial of the right of the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to participate in the United Nations system. Taiwan has shown significant commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and has aligned its priorities with those of the Organization. Humankind could therefore benefit a great deal from Taiwanâ??s experience in the framework of our global agenda as Member of the United Nations. I reaffirm the full commitment of the Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini to implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, it is worth noting that while our Goals may be universal, we do not all have the same capabilities and capacities for implementing them. As we recognize those resource and capacity constraints, therefore, we need to enhance resources, capacity-building, technology transfer and South-South cooperation so as to support lower middle-income countries, along with the least developed countries, in achieving our ambitious and transformative Agenda.",1,196
7867,Session 72 - 2017,SYC_72_2017.txt,SYC_72_2017,72,2017,SYC,"I would like to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating His Excellency Mr Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would also like to thank His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson for making the small island developing States and the rest of the international community proud through his strong leadership of the seventy- first session. May I start by saying that the thoughts of the Government and the people of Seychelles go out to the millions of people in South Asia, Africa, the United States and Mexico, as well as our island brothers and sisters in the Caribbean, who have suffered unimaginable losses from floods, hurricanes and other forms of extreme weather these past months.We urge the international community to not only respond generously to those countriesâ?? calls for support, but also to take the need to upscale the urgent action required far more seriously in order to prevent, prepare for, adapt to and recover from such increasingly destructive climate-related disasters. Events around the world today sadly show that the theme of this yearâ??s general debate, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, cannot be achieved without effective implementation of the principles of democracy and a concerted demonstration of will. That calls for good governance, transparency and accountability, which serve as the foundation for the prosperity and security of all nations. Indeed, they put the rights and aspirations of the people at the centre of development, where prosperity is shared by all. We must create the necessary space in society for diverging views and ideas to flourish and be respected. Doing so helps promote unity, tolerance and respect in the population. Seychelles is, for the first time in its history, experiencing a system of political cohabitation where I, as President and head of the executive arm, am working with a legislature dominated by the opposition. When I first addressed our legislature at the National Assembly almost a year ago last October, I gave my word that we would work together to deliver a better future for our people. Our cohabitation is working well. There is a new working environment in which we have dialogue and where we consult. Most importantly, it is an environment based on mutual respect. We are reshaping our Government to make it more inclusive. We are empowering our citizens, especially our youth, by giving them equal opportunities to play important roles in the development of our country and the growth of our economy. In that context, we are improving the environment for free media to play a vital role in nation-building efforts. Together with the National Assembly we are amending legislation relating to institutions, authorities and agencies so as to ensure that they reflect the new principles of good governance. With greater transparency, good governance and accountability, the independence of institutions and authorities will continue to increase. They are the bedrock of our society. We are writing a new chapter in Seychelles, where we work together to overcome our challenges and show respect for all opinions in the interest of a Seychelles that unites all of us despite our differences. Openness and a policy of discourse are at the core of my nationâ??s willingness to secure a bold future for our people. I believe that small island developing States such as mine can serve as the moral barometers for what is right. We do not shy from accepting and learning from the experiences of others but, in that regard, we also have valuable lessons to share with others. The path that we are charting in our country can serve as an example to all for the sake of tolerance and a global lasting peace. That has been our experience in Seychelles. But as we look around us, what do we see? We see growing instability on a national and regional scale. That is a hindrance to peace and to a decent and sustainable life for all of our peoples. We believe that such factors lie at the heart of the global refugee crisis. That is a problem that could worsen owing to the increasing movements of populations as a result of climate change. A globalized world economy requires us to act as organized regions in order to give ourselves the best possible chance of transforming our hopes into tangible improvements in the quality of life for our peoples by strengthening the values of democracy and good governance. That also applies to this institution â?? the United Nations. Indeed, after a quarter of a century of reforms and counter-reforms of the Security Council, it is high time to harken to the deafening call of more than 160 States Members of the United Nations for true and just reforms. That would be a way for us to react to the accusations that the United Nations is simply a room in which to hold rambling discussions. We would also have an opportunity to practice what we preach. For there to be peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, it is not enough just to throw more resources â?? financial, human and others â?? into implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. All of those processes should be democratically governed, underpinned by transparency and accountability throughout and in harmony with and with respect for the natural environment in which we live. In Seychelles, the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and parliamentarians have joined with the public sector in a national effort to integrate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals into our countryâ??s budget and development plans. Together we are drafting a new national development strategy and a more sustainable national development plan for Seychelles over the next 15 years called Vision 2032. That exercise also includes the integration of Agenda 2063, adopted by the African Union, and the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action. The same inclusive approach applies to stepping up our implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in the light of recent developments. According to the latest science, all stakeholders need to be involved if the international community is to drastically upscale our collective climate action so as to achieve our targets. There is something that I said at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech in November 2016 that is even more pertinent today, as we head towards the next Conference of the Parties, led by our fellow small island developing State of Fiji and supported by Germany. Referring to the Paris Agreement, I said, â??For the very first time in history, a global climate-change deal, giving renewed hope to the world, has been reached. We find ourselves at a crossroads and cannot afford to renege on our collective commitment to travel the moral path for the sake of humanity.â?? From small islands come big ideas. Last year Seychelles reached an agreement with the Paris Club and others on a first-of-its-kind $21 million debt- for-adaptation swap to protect 30 per cent of our 1.37-million-square-kilometre exclusive economic zone, partly as an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change. Also, by the end of this year, we aim to launch the worldâ??s first blue bonds to raise another $15 million for sustainable fishing practices in our waters. Both of those measures seek to establish innovative sources of financing to implement Sustainable Development Goal 14, on oceans and seas, and other interlinked SDGs as part of developing the Seychellesâ?? blue economy. We thank our many partners at home and abroad who have helped us on this bold and exciting new path to sustainable development and resilience to climate change and who continue to be actively involved. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Fiji and Sweden for the great success of the Ocean Conference in June and its Call for Action. As President of a large-ocean developing State, I would like to reiterate Seychellesâ?? commitment to continuing to play a pioneering role in the search for innovative ways to respond to the Call for Action and implement SDG 14 as an integral part of all the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda. On that positive note, I wish all the peoples of the world a happy International Peace Day.",1,196
7868,Session 72 - 2017,SYR_72_2017.txt,SYR_72_2017,72,2017,SYR,"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and wish him every success. I would also like to thank his predecessor for the important role he played at the helm of the General Assembly during the seventy-first session. I congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as Secretary-General and wish him all the best in carrying out his responsibilities in service of the purposes and principles of the United Nations as set forth in the Charter. As we meet again, our world is facing challenges and dangers that are mounting on a daily basis. There is a persistent stand-off between two sets of forces â?? one that strives to control and dominate nations and their riches by seeking to turn back the clock, re-establish a unipolar world order, fuel chaos and war and violate international humanitarian law, and one that, in opposition, is working tirelessly to create a more balanced, secure and just world, respecting the sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to exercise self-determination and build their own future. As we meet again, many people continue to pay dearly with their lives, losing the security, stability and livelihoods they once had, as a result of policies forced upon them by certain countries. These countries falsely believe that they can use terrorism as a tool to satisfy their greed and further ill-conceived agendas that do not serve the interests of any people, let alone their own. No people have suffered as greatly at the hands of terrorism as the Syrian people, who, for six years now, have fought against terrorism pouring in from all over the world, with the support of parties from across the region and beyond. For more than six years, Syrians have endured the worst conditions and made the greatest sacrifices in order to defend their country in a terrorist war of unprecedented brutality that has spared nothing and no one. It has targeted innocent people, services, infrastructure and cultural heritage, and yet Syria is more determined than ever to eradicate terrorism from every part of the country without exception, relying on the selfless sacrifices of our army and the dedication of our people. Since the beginning of the war, our State policy has followed two main tracks: combating terrorism and working towards a political solution that will end the bloodshed and restore stability. On the counter-terrorism front, the Syrian Arab Army, along with its supporting forces and allies, is making daily achievements in clearing out terrorist-occupied territories and removing the terrorists themselves. Nevertheless, the threat of this plague persists as terrorists claim the lives of Syrians on a daily basis and deplete the countryâ??s resources. We must all understand that terrorism and the underlying extremist takfiri ideology will continue to spread like a tumour throughout the world and haunt our peoples unless every one of us demonstrates a genuine will to cooperate and confront it together. Any such endeavour must respect the sovereignty of States and the interests of the people, and it must set aside the illusion that terrorism can be used as a tool for political gains and narrow interests. On the political front, since the early months of the crisis the Syrian Government has spared no effort to stop the bloodshed. The success of reconciliation at the local level would not have been possible without the leadership, political support and numerous amnesty decrees issued by President Bashar Al-Assad, which allowed everyone who had taken up arms to lay them down and resume their normal lives. These successful acts of reconciliation have allowed tens of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees to return home and helped to improve the living conditions of a great number of Syrians who had fallen victim to terrorist crimes. Syria is determined to scale up its reconciliation efforts wherever possible, as this is the best way to alleviate the suffering of Syrians and restore stability and normality. Since the very first day, the Syrian Government has considered all initiatives to put an end to the war with an open mind. However, all these initiatives eventually failed because States sponsoring terrorism persisted in their decision to pursue aggressive policies against Syria and its people. With regard to the Astana and Geneva tracks, the Syrian Government has shown how serious and committed it is by doing its best to provide the conditions necessary for these efforts to succeed and for their goals to be achieved. We are encouraged by the Astana process and the resulting de-escalation zones, and we hope that it will help us to achieve an actual cessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Jabhat al-Nusrah and others from the groups that have agreed to join the process. This will be the real test of how committed and serious these groups and their Turkish sponsors are. So far, under President ErdoÄ?an, Turkey has continued to pursue its aggressive policies against the Syrian people and laboured under the illusion that terrorism will help serve its subversive agendas in Syria and other countries of the region. Turkeyâ??s position stands in stark contrast to the positive and constructive role played by Russia and Iran. Notwithstanding its commitment to the memorandum on the creation of de-escalation areas in the Syrian Arab Republic, Syria reserves the right to respond to any violation by other parties. Syria also stresses that the de-escalation zones are a temporary arrangement that must not violate the territorial unity of Syria. The Syrian Government reaffirms its commitment to the Geneva process and to making further progress on this track. In the absence of a genuine national opposition that could be a partner in Syriaâ??s future and as countries with influence over the other parties continue to block meaningful progress, this process has yet to bear fruit. It is truly unfortunate that among the countries blocking a solution in Syria are members of this international Organization and even permanent members of the Security Council. The Syrian Government has always insisted that any solution in Syria must respect the countryâ??s non-negotiable principles, its red line for all Syrians. These principles include the complete rejection of terrorism, the unity of the territory and the people of Syria, and the rejection of any outside interference in political decisions involving Syriaâ??s future. Only Syrians have the right to make such decisions, whether now or in future. Absolutely no one can deprive the free Syrian people of their will to build the future of their country. For decades, Israel has continued its unscrupulous, thuggish actions with full impunity. This usurper entity has occupied Arab territories in Palestine and the Golan for more than 70 years and has committed horrific crimes against innocent civilians. Israel has not stopped there; it has publicly interfered in the Syrian crisis since its earliest days, providing all forms of support, including funds, weapons, materiel and communications equipment, to the most visible terrorist gangs. Israel has also bombed Syrian army positions in service to terrorist agendas. Coordination between the Israel and the terrorists was at its highest point when terrorist groups decided to target Syrian air-defence assets that are used to defend Syria against Israeli aggression. The unlimited Israeli support provided to terrorists in Syria does not come as a surprise. After all, they share the same interests and goals. Let me be clear, however: it is delusional to believe even for a moment that the crisis in Syria will make us forget our inalienable right to fully recover the occupied Syrian Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967. For more than six years, the States and parties that were behind the war in Syria have continued to peddle lies and falsely accuse the Syrian Government of using chemical weapons despite the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmation that Syria has fully eliminated its chemical programme. This is proof enough of an ill-conceived intention to tarnish the true image of the Syrian Government in the eyes of the international public and to come up with new excuses for continued aggression against Syria, which naturally favours the terrorists and their supporters. So it was when the United States blatantly attacked the Shayrat air base, claiming that it contained chemical weapons used in the alleged Khan Shaykhun attack. And, as we have done with regard to every accusation of this kind, we confirm our readiness to receive and cooperate with United Nations investigation teams. Certain countries have boasted about fighting terrorism in Syria and having the interests of Syrians at heart. They have established coalitions and held dozens of conferences under deceptive titles, such as the Group of Friends of the Syrian People. It is quite ironic that these same countries are shedding the blood of thousands of Syrians through their support for terrorists, bombing innocent civilians and destroying their livelihoods. The so-called Global Coalition against Daâ??esh, created three years ago, allegedly to fight terrorist groups such as ISIL, and led by the United States, has killed many more innocent Syrians, mostly women and children, than terrorists, and has destroyed vital infrastructure that Syrians had worked for years to build. It has also flagrantly used phosphorus bombs and other internationally prohibited weapons for all the world to see. We cannot understand the silence of the international community in the face of these crimes. The international community has not condemned or sought to stop these crimes even though the Syrian Government has repeatedly appealed to the Security Council to assume its main responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. The Syrian Government has urged the Council to implement its own resolutions on counter-terrorism, in particular resolution 2253 (2015), and prevent the Global Coalition from committing even more crimes against the citizens of my country. While the Global Coalition has failed to make any meaningful progress against the terrorist group ISIL, the Syrian army, together with its allies and friends, has been able to secure real and significant gains and drive terrorists out of large parts of the Syrian desert. In what was considered a strategic achievement, the Army was recently able to break the siege inflicted by ISIL on the city of Deir ez-Zor and its people more than three years ago. This achievement will significantly improve the humanitarian situation in the city and contribute to the fight against terrorism in general. We have declared more than once that it is impossible to fight terrorism without coordinating with the Syrian Government. It is the only way to make real gains in the war on terrorism. Any presence of foreign troops on Syrian territory without the consent of the Government is considered a form of occupation, wanton aggression and a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. The war that the most powerful countries and terrorist groups are waging against Syria is not just a military war. It has taken other forms, no less brutal or aggressive, in order to break the will of the Syrian people and punish them for their firm support of the Army as it strives to defend Syriaâ??s political independence and territorial unity. That is why those countries have imposed a stifling economic blockade against Syria in blatant violation of international law, with a view to destroying the livelihoods of Syrians and increasing their suffering. These unilateral, coercive measures have been thrust upon vital sectors, most notably health-care services. Syria used to have an advanced health-care system. However, today, Syrians are denied access to many types of medicine, even those needed to treat life-threatening conditions, such as cancer. Sanctions such as these are a clear sign of certain countriesâ?? hypocrisy as they shed tears over the suffering of Syrians while in fact practicing a more surreptitious form of terrorism. The refugee problem is one of the consequences of terrorism. As Syria will need the efforts of every Syrian in the near future, the Syrian Government has made their return to their homes a top priority. To this end, the Syrian Government has embarked on a mission to liberate and secure areas occupied by terrorists and improve the basic living conditions of all Syrians. Given that the United Nations has failed to uphold its own Charter and the principles of international law, all of us must consider reforming the Organization so that it can play its role effectively and defend legitimate rights from the law of the jungle that some are trying to impose. Our nations are yearning for a safer, more secure, stable and prosperous world. That world will remain a fantasy as long as certain countries maintain the belief that they can foment chaos and mayhem and force their will upon the world with full impunity. With its resolute people, its courageous Army and the support of its loyal allies, my country is steadily marching towards the goal of rooting out terrorism. The liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the lifting of the siege of Deir ez-Zor and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria prove that victory is now within reach. I am confident that, when the unjust war on Syria is over, the Syrian Army will go down in history as the army that heroically defeated â?? with the help of supporting forces and allies â?? terrorists who came to Syria from many countries and received broad support in the form of weapons, funding, training, access and political cover from the most powerful countries in the world. Those terrorists have tried and failed to impose their backward ideology on a peaceful nation that was once a cradle of civilization. For generations to come, history books will recount the achievements of the Syrian people and their dedication as they countered a barbaric terrorist campaign and fought unfair measures designed to compound their suffering and deprive them of their basic requirements. The Syrian people have stood their ground against all odds because they know that this war has been waged to eliminate their country and, with it, their very existence. Theirs is an example to follow for any people facing â?? today or in future â?? similar attempts to break their will and deny them their freedom and sovereignty.",1,196
7869,Session 72 - 2017,TCD_72_2017.txt,TCD_72_2017,72,2017,TCD,"Allow me to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to assure him of our cooperation as he carries out his important mission. I would also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson, who led the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session with talent and discernment. A decade ago in the Assembly, we deplored the emergence of various global crises, in particular financial ones and their adverse consequences on the world economy. Even today, developing countries, including my own, continue to suffer the consequences of the fall in the prices of our exports. This situation negatively impacts the financing of our countriesâ?? development plans and strategies. Humankind is also called upon to address new kinds of conflicts, such as those related to the challenges of terrorism, whose growing tentacles threaten our stability and further impoverish our economies. Equally important are the challenges related to climatic and environmental hazards, whose damaging consequences have been demonstrated in the recent landslide in Sierra Leone, the onslaught of the hurricanes in the Caribbean and the United States, and the earthquake in Mexico. We take the opportunity to express, from this rostrum, our solidarity with the bereaved Governments and families in the various affected countries. Moreover, the ongoing phenomena of drought and desertification weaken our ecosystems, in particular the drying up of Lake Chad, causing massive population displacements and increasing pressure on the already limited resources of our countries. Its foreseeable disappearance would be a disaster for the 50 million human beings who live off the resources that Lake Chad provides. The letter and spirit of the theme of our current session and the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change should encourage the international community to save Lake Chad. The economic and financial crisis affecting developing countries is undermining the efficient implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was tirelessly built on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals. Its adoption in 2015 gave rise to a great deal of hope because it is supposed to reverse the growth of poverty and promote development. However, with the persistence of the economic crisis, recurring threats to peace and security, the appearance of cyclical pandemics and the increase in the phenomenon of migration, we fear that these scourges will have a negative impact on the implementation of the Agenda. In this difficult economic context, in early September in Paris Chad organized a round table to finance its national development plan. We take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed to the success of the round table. We hope that the pledges made on that occasion will be fulfilled. At the political level, Chad intends to consolidate its institutions and strengthen the democratic process by renewing its institutional framework. With this in mind, next October, in line with the social project of President of the Republic of Chad, His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, Chad will convene a national forum on the institutional reforms charged with adapting the administrative and political structures to the countryâ??s new realities. In addition to the difficult economic context, we in the subregion of the Sahel and the Sahara face particular security and humanitarian challenges. Indeed, the security situation in the countries of the Sahel and the Sahara continues to deteriorate as a result of the actions of terrorists, armed groups and traffickers of all stripes throughout the region. Recent attacks by terrorists in the capital of Burkina Faso and against the forces of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, as well as almost daily attacks in north-eastern Nigeria and the far north of Cameroon, show their determination to wage war against us to the end. This resurgence of terrorist attacks challenges us and compels us to respond. This is why the countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), following the example of the Multinational Joint Task Force, have established the G-5 Sahel Joint Force in the Lake Chad basin to fight the Daâ??esh-affiliated terrorist group Boko Haram. In Mali, as in the Lake Chad basin, my country is committed and has made enormous human, material and financial sacrifices. This commitment â?? undertaken by the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, with the support of all Chadians â?? will endure because the collective security of the region and beyond is at stake. We must therefore consolidate our means of response if we want to counter this evil. The multifaceted support of the international community, and in particular of our Organization, is indispensable. We recognize the primary responsibility of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. Chad supports its peacekeeping operations throughout the world. Therefore, there is no question of our replacing the other forces engaged in Mali. The G-5 Sahel Joint Force is a complementary entity whose objective is to respond appropriately to the asymmetrical and unconventional warfare waged by terrorists and traffickers of all kinds. It is for this reason that we call upon the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, to grant a robust mandate to ensure that the Joint Force has sustainable resources to carry out its tasks. The humanitarian situation is exacerbated by the particularly difficult security situation in our subregion, which is reflected in large-scale humanitarian crises, the massive displacement of people, famine, malnutrition and epidemics. For the past several decades, my country has welcomed more than 600,000 refugees and displaced persons fleeing conflicts in neighbouring countries, as well as returnees and internally displaced persons following the conflicts in Libya and the Central African Republic. The current global situation and the persistence of hotbeds of tension in Chad are a source of serious concern for my country. While we recognize the sustained support of all our partners for the humanitarian problem in Chad, we call on the international community to make greater efforts to alleviate the suffering of the host populations, refugees and displaced persons. One of the consequences of economic difficulties and unrest is the massive migration of young Africans to other places, particularly Europe. That is an unbearable phenomenon, considering the conditions of travel and residence in certain countries of transit and reception. That is why Chad, which is a transit country for migrants, is consulting with its various partners to address the root causes of the phenomenon and calls for massive investment in the development programmes in the countries of origin of migrants in order to put a stop to the loss of human resources. The humanitarian situation can be resolved only if the outbreaks of conflict in the neighbouring countries of Chad are resolved. That is why the Chadian Government is very attentive to those conflicts and will continue to work with the international community to put an end to them. The violence in the Central African Republic continues. Chad welcomes the steps taken by President Touadera and his Government to assert the presence and authority of the State. He has urged all armed factions to commit themselves without delay to the peace process. We believe that the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic is the opportunity that all parties to the conflict should seize in order to restore peace and security in that brotherly country. Regarding the situation in Libya, Chad gives its full support to the United Nations and the African Union in the search for reconciliation among the various Libyan parties. But the solution to the crisis is in the hands of the Libyan political actors themselves, who have the historical responsibility to meet the expectations of their people. South Sudan is like a wound on the body of our continent. Here too, the protagonists have a moral obligation to put an end to the intolerable suffering of the people. The international community should support the revitalization of the August 2015 agreement and the national dialogue. At the international level, Chad welcomed the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. There is no longer any obstacle to the normalization of relations between the two countries. My country believes, therefore, that maintaining the decades-long embargo against Cuba is unfair and counterproductive. The Palestinian question remains a fundamental issue, with evident repercussions on other crises. Thus a just and acceptable solution must be found, one that includes the peaceful coexistence of the two States of Israel and Palestine. Therefore, Chad will support all efforts aimed at the recognition of the State of Palestine in all its aspects and on the basis of the 1967 borders. The world has been facing an unacceptable crisis in recent weeks, that of the plight of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma, who are suffering a veritable ethnic-religious purge. Chad believes that the whole world must rise up in opposition and call on the Burmese Government to put an immediate end to that tragedy. The Republic of Chad is deeply concerned about the threats to world peace caused by the nuclear tests conducted by North Korea. The leaders of that country must gauge the dramatic consequences that could come about as a result of that policy and should prioritize dialogue in order to assert their rights. Finally, with regard to the proposals for United Nations reform, Chad reiterates the common position of Africa as determined by the African Group in New York, which emerged from the Ezulwini Consensus. We believe that the best way to reform the United Nations is to reform the Security Council and to grant a seat to Africa as a permanent member, thus enabling it to be involved in the decision-making process in world affairs. Whether with regard to economic, climatic or environmental questions or domestic or international issues, Chad has always been guided by concern to ensure the safety and welfare that the citizens of the world have the right to expect from their leaders. My country invites each of the States represented here today to implement the theme adopted this year by the Assembly in order to better our planet and the lives of its inhabitants.",1,196
7870,Session 72 - 2017,TGO_72_2017.txt,TGO_72_2017,72,2017,TGO,"It is indeed both a pleasure and an honour to address the General Assembly and to convey cordial greetings from the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna GnassingbÃ©, who, because of a last-minute commitment, could not be here with us in New York. I take the floor to deliver the following message on his behalf. â??It is with a renewed sense of joy that we take part in the seventy-second regular session of the General Assembly, which is dedicated to a theme that is as revealing as it is inspiring â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. â??First and foremost, I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, on his election. I would also like to reiterate my congratulations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, and assure him of Togoâ??s support during his tenure, as we strive to achieve the noble objectives of our Organization. â??The theme of this session reminds us that human beings and the well-being of our peoples must remain the priority of our actions, both at the national level and at the international level as we pool our efforts. In the context of our debates, this theme raises the issue of human security, which encompasses both the imperatives of peace, development, access to quality health care, a healthy environment, food security and jobs, in particular for young people. â??Those challenges that our State faces, in particular the developing countries, are a reminder of the importance of implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, all of which we adopted together. â??In that regard, my country is working actively to adopt its national development plan before the end of the year. That plan will replace the strategy for accelerated growth, development and the promotion of employment for the period 2018-2022, which is coming to an end. The new development planning document will identify priorities and define the appropriate actions to be implemented in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. â??With that in mind, in February 2017, the Government set up a strategic monitoring unit for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and international development agreements. The unit is tasked with monitoring the progress of priority action undertaken on those fronts. Togo, which is preparing to take a seat on the Economic and Social Council as of 1 January 2018, is committed to taking an active part in the various actions and initiatives of the Council, with a view to achieving a harmonious and resolute implementation of the 2030 Agenda. â??The quest for the well-being of people is at the core of the general policy of the Togolese Government. That need guides sectoral initiatives on a day-to-day basis by giving priority to the most vulnerable groups, such as women, children and young people. More specifically, my country, while maintaining consistency in the progress already achieved in the areas of economic growth, poverty reduction and the promotion of a peaceful and participatory democracy, spares no effort in its attempt to ensure genuine inclusive and sustainable growth for the population. â??The emergency community development programme, designed to complement the programme for vulnerable populations, for the period 2016-2018, aims to help bring about considerable improvement in the living conditions of people in communities where basic social and economic services and infrastructure highlight social inequalities. Over the long term, those inequalities must be reduced with targeted action so as to meet urgent and priority needs, carried out in synergy with other activities that are part of normal sectoral policies. Such action focuses primarily on access to drinking water, access to energy, rural entrepreneurship and agribusiness, productivity and wealth creation, employment, the empowerment of women and young people, and social protection. â??With regard to social protection, for example, it should be noted that, following the decision to make education free of charge in 2008 and school canteens gradually available to all public- school children, the Government decided to establish a social and medical benefits system for schoolchildren. That measure, which will be extended to private secular and faith-based sectors in the coming years, will cater to 2 million children involved in the pilot phase of the project. â??In addition, in the field of health, the development of the new national health development plan for the period 2017-2022 enables the Government to provide appropriate solutions to the problems identified and to align national priorities with those of the Sustainable Development Goals. â??The harmonious and sustainable development of Togo cannot be achieved without peace, social cohesion, the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law. Above and beyond the various action taken to improve the well-being of the population, those requirements to achieve such development will also depend on the political, institutional and constitutional reforms under way. In that regard, drawing on the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Government recently transmitted to the National Assembly for consideration a bill on articles 52, 59 and 60 of the Constitution of 14 October 1992, relating in particular to limiting mandates to a term of five years, renewable once, for members of the National Assembly and the President of the Republic, and to the voting method, which is a first-past-the-post system with two rounds. â??That reform project, which meets the profound hopes and desires of the Togolese people, was adopted just three days ago, on Tuesday, 19 September, by more than two thirds of the members of the National Assembly. It should be underscored that that process was carried out in accordance with the provisions of article 144 of the Constitution, which stipulates the procedure for constitutional revision as follows: â??The bill or the proposal of revision is considered as adopted if it is voted with the majority of four fifths of the deputies composing the National Assembly. In default of this majority, the bill or proposal of revision, adopted with the majority of two thirds of the deputies composing the National Assembly, is submitted to referendum.â?? â??In addition, the voting on the bill or proposal by a two-thirds majority of the members of the National Assembly raises the issue of constitutional reform directly with the people through the holding of a referendum. A bill will be submitted immediately to the people for ratification. As the history of our country reflects, a referendum will enable the country to freely and fully exercise its sovereignty, by making the text of the Constitution a fundamental norm. â??With regard to human rights, the will of the Togolese Government to fulfil its obligations in the protection and promotion of such rights is irreversible. It was a long-term undertaking, but Togo remained committed to consolidating the gains made and to further strengthening the measures guaranteeing fundamental freedoms. We will also continue to work within our mandate at the Human Rights Council, which expires in 2018, in order to ensure that that body plays its full role in respecting human rights and protecting the well- being of the peoples of the world. â??With regard to the challenges facing our States, I call on the entire international community to take responsible action to mitigate the threat of global warming. The quality of life of the people on our planet must be preserved for the good of future generations. My country, which often faces the vagaries of coastal erosion, flooding and irregular rainy seasons, believes that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change remains an ideal framework for carrying out joint initiatives that will safeguard the climate. â??In West Africa, the recent bad weather, which resulted in significant loss of life in Sierra Leone and tens of thousands of victims in the Niger, has conjured up in peopleâ??s memories the spectre of the terrible Ebola crisis that the subregion had to deal with two years ago. Those losses, which we all lament, should compel our individual States and those outside the African continent to act urgently to develop a rigorous and effective plan for ensuring that our peoples have decent living standards and a resilient health-care system, with particular emphasis on our technical servicesâ?? early-warning and prevention capabilities. To that end, I would like to urge States to work together to intensify our efforts, not only to prevent the resurgence of previously eradicated epidemics but also to significantly reduce and even eliminate other diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which, tragically, continue to cause many casualties in Africa. â??The era we live in has also been marked by a surge in new security challenges, from maritime insecurity to terrorism, which we must fight in all their forms. Maritime insecurity undermines our development, deprives our people of vital resources and creates areas of lawlessness that criminal networks try to exploit for their various types of trafficking. Togo was therefore pleased with the success of the African Unionâ??s Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government on Maritime Security, Safety and Development in Africa, held in LomÃ© in October 2016. Today, thanks to the commitment of the States that participated in the Summit, we now have the African Union Charter on Maritime Security, Safety and Development, a harmonized, legally binding instrument aimed at promoting the development of the blue economy in Africa. I would also like to take this opportunity to invite and encourage countries that have not yet signed the LomÃ© Charter to do so, and thereby strengthen the legal framework for regulating our Statesâ?? joint action, under the auspices of the African Union, for preserving our seas and oceans. â??We cannot deny that we will never be able to achieve the goal that is the theme of this yearâ??s session if we do not intensify our efforts to maintain world peace and security. The recent terrorist attacks in France, Great Britain, Spain, Burkina Faso, CÃ´te dâ??Ivoire, Mali and other countries have highlighted the importance of concerted action on the part of the entire international community if we are to tackle this scourge, which knows no borders and does not discriminate among its targets. That is why in the region where it is most prevalent in Africa, the Sahel, I commend the initiative of the countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which will help us further strengthen inter-State cooperation, and urge the most affluent countries among us to support the push for an effective fight that will enable us to eradicate terrorism in that part of Africa. In that regard, I was particularly pleased with the Secretary-Generalâ??s establishment of the Office of Counter-Terrorism in June. Eliminating radicalism and religious fundamentalism should also be a major priority for our States, along with our urgent duty to provide convincing alternatives, especially for young people, that can guarantee their future and shield them from the rhetoric of hatred and other appeals to violence. â??In view of the major challenge that migration represents today and the security crisis it creates, we should take strong measures not only to limit the ever-increasing demands placed on countries of destination but especially to tackle the problem where it begins, in the countries of origin. Finding adequate solutions to the migration crisis also means finding definitive solutions to the various conflicts that undermine the ability of the States concerned to ensure effective control over their borders and result in the massive displacement of populations seeking security and a better life outside their own countries. We all know that the crises in Syria and Libya, and the fierce fight that the Iraqi Government is currently waging against the Islamic State, are not confined to those countriesâ?? borders, but have attendant results that include the destabilization of their regions, worsening terrorism and a migration crisis. In that regard, it is Togoâ??s hope that in Africa, the various initiatives of the African Union and other regional organizations, supported by the United Nations, will help to resolve the disputes in South Sudan and restore stability in Libya. â??In Asia, the recent missile launches by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea have raised tensions within the international community, sparked heated debates in the Security Council and increased peopleâ??s fears, particularly in Japan and the Republic of Korea. I urge the main protagonists to exercise restraint and reason in order to preserve peace and stability in the region. There can be no question that only dialogue and concerted efforts can settle this issue. â??The challenges that our world is facing are having a real impact on Africaâ??s development. If we are to tackle them effectively, one of the most urgent tasks still ahead of us is the economic transformation of the continent. We are well aware that it is the African elite that has primary responsibility for that transformation, but we would also like to emphasize the importance in that regard of international solidarity. Besides the efforts that must be made to implement the SDGs, it will be crucial to foster investment in Africa, particularly in science, industry, agribusiness and advanced technology. Our transformation will also require the efforts of the various regional economic communities. By ensuring that their peoples and economies are properly integrated, they can promote African integration generally and thereby contribute to harmonious development in Africa as a whole. â??In my capacity as current Chairperson of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), I pledge to work with my colleagues to make our shared space an ECOWAS of our peoples, in accordance with the objectives of our organization. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners and invite them to continue to work alongside our States and the ECOWAS Commission with a view to translating our multiple initiatives into concrete action. â??The United Nations has helped the world to make a great deal of progress in the areas of peace and security, the promotion of human rights and the preservation of our planet. It has been able to achieve those advances thanks to its revitalization of some of its organs and, above all, by adapting them to the changes that have taken place since the Organization was founded. With regard to reform of the Security Council, Togo believes that Member States should resolve to conclude the process, which began more than two decades ago, with the goal of making the Council more effective. We hope that significant progress can be made in that direction during this session. The reforms should also encompass our peacekeeping forces. In that regard, we commend the Secretary-Generalâ??s initiative for a draft compact between the United Nations and its Member States on eliminating sexual exploitation and abuse during peacekeeping operations, and we hope that all States will adhere to it so as to put an end to this problem for good. â??I firmly believe that, by working together during this session, the General Assembly will make a significant contribution to strengthening our Statesâ?? commitment to making our planet a world of shared peace and prosperity for the well- being of our peoples.â??",1,196
7871,Session 72 - 2017,THA_72_2017.txt,THA_72_2017,72,2017,THA,"I believe that I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that our hearts and prayers are with everyone in the small States of the Caribbean, now facing the devastating effects of a series of hurricanes. Our deepest sympathy and prayers are also with the people of Mexico, who have suffered immensely from the deadly earthquake on Tuesday. Over the past few days, the words â??we the peoplesâ?? have been echoed in the General Assembly many times. Thailand shares the view of Secretary-General Guterres and many Member States that we need to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy. The United Nations must be less about debates and more about actions that truly impact changes on the ground. In the General Assembly this year, it is gratifying to hear world leaders focusing on people. The life, survival and prosperity of a nation depend on the quality of life of its people. When people live decent lives, they thrive and, in turn, nations and our planet prosper. On the other hand, if people still have to struggle in their daily lives, have nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, no schooling or health-care access, then the advancement of nations would be an unrealizable ambition. That is why we must focus on people. In fact, we have long focused on the people of Thailand. Our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, told us to listen to the people and to learn from them. He said that those living in the community know best about their conditions and needs. Development must not be top-down but bottom-up and must vary according to specific contexts. His Majesty laid the groundwork for the people-centred approach through the â??sufficiency economyâ?? philosophy, which stresses self-development and places emphasis on everyoneâ??s potential to mould their own future and live in harmony with nature. When each person can contribute meaningfully to his or her community, the life of the nation will surely be good. Based on the sufficiency economy philosophy, the Royal Thai Government envisions the lives of our people and the life of our nation as stable, prosperous and sustainable. Our key national frameworks, namely, the 2017 Constitution, the 20-year National Strategy Framework and the twelfth National Economic and Social Development Plan, have all been formulated to focus on people first. Thailand has stepped up efforts to put in place a decentralized area-based development policy to empower those who will be affected and create a space to appreciate local wisdom and knowledge. At the same time, Thailand is seeking to utilize science, technology and innovation to strengthen human capabilities and foster an enabling environment in our development paradigm. Currently, we aim to build a value-based economy under the Thailand 4.0 policy. The value-based economy encompasses various types of economy: a circular economy, in which resources are utilized efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner; a distributive economy, where development is inclusive; and an innovative economy, where growth springs from ideas and knowledge. The value-based economy under the Thailand 4.0 policy requires human wisdom even more than high technology. That is why we are focusing on our people and putting human life-cycle development as our priority. Since 2002, we have successfully embarked upon our universal health coverage system. That system represents an investment in our people and our future. At present, 99.87 per cent of the population enjoys some kind of health coverage. The Universal Health Coverage system has helped prevent more than 100,000 households from falling into poverty over the past decade. As Chair of the Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative, Thailand will present a draft resolution at this session of the General Assembly to mark 12 December as World Universal Health Coverage Day. We hope to receive support from Member States in that regard. Another recent example of how we focus on people is our national strategy to eliminate HIV/AIDS. By 2030, Thailand aims to reduce new HIV infections, lower the number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths and reduce discrimination related to HIV and gender. We are also proud to say that in 2016 the World Health Organization recognized Thailand as the first country in Asia, and the second country in the world, to eliminate mother- to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. The world is going through a critical time and is facing a series of shared challenges, such as extremism, terrorism, ongoing conflicts and irregular migration, along with environmental degradation, climate change and natural disasters. Another grave concern is the nuclear threat, which is looming over us and feels more real now than ever before. It is at times like this that humankind is truly being tested. Two days ago Thailand signed and deposited our instrument of ratification to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We are proud to be among the first countries to do so. We wish to call on others to do the same. By doing so, we are sending a message to our children and grandchildren that we care. Thailand shares the international communityâ??s grave concern about the situation on the Korean peninsula, where we encourage all parties to find a peaceful solution, along with the full implementation of Security Council resolutions. Thailand is also deeply concerned about ongoing violence and conflicts elsewhere in the world, including the situation in Rakhine state, which recently caused hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes. We are fully aware of the complexities of humanitarian situations, which cannot be solved overnight. Those situations call for long-term political and socioeconomic solutions. Sustaining peace and sustaining development must go hand in hand. In order to enable people to have decent lives, we must build inclusive societies where everyone has a sense of belonging and feels that his/her voice is heard and their views taken into consideration. We must empower the most vulnerable in our societies â?? those suffering in poverty, women, children and persons with disabilities â?? and leave no one behind. Their rights and dignity must be respected. They must be protected by law and have equal access to justice. Only then can we realize a truly inclusive society with sustainable peace and development. To sum up, my delegation would like to leave the Assembly with three key messages. First, multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, has a great role to play in fostering the quality of our peopleâ??s lives. The United Nations must take transformative steps to live up to todayâ??s reality and expectations. Development programmes, financial and technical assistance, peace operations, security sanctions, resource mobilization, and environmental protection programmes must all truly enhance the quality of life of the people. The work of the United Nations must have real impact on the ground. The United Nations must be able to identify challenges based on the needs and particular situations of each country, and must be able to adapt its work in a responsive and flexible manner. It must also address the root cause of each problem, especially by addressing structural gaps and focusing more on prevention rather than on curing symptoms. We look forward to hearing more details on the United Nations development system reform and how it would impact action on the ground, enhance resource efficiency and synergize the work of regional commissions and United Nations country teams. We also wish to hear about innovative resource mobilization and enhanced partnerships with all stakeholders, especially the private sector, academia and civil society. Partnerships, particularly with science, technology and innovation communities, would bring about the transformative push that is required in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Secondly, we must learn to mobilize each of our diverse individual strengths. We must ensure that local wisdom and community knowledge are appreciated and integrated into our efforts. We must create a culture of partnerships that is based on mutual trust and respect. For our part, Thailand recognizes and appreciates the diversity of strengths of each stakeholder. We value the sharing of knowledge and experiences. It is in that spirit that Thailand has launched the sufficiency economy philosophy for the SDGs partnership so as to encourage the sharing of the sufficiency economy philosophy in advancing the SDGs. As part of our efforts to promote South-South cooperation, last year Thailand supported the reopening of the United Nations Office for South- South Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific in Thailand and has provided human resources to the Office. Last but not least, focusing on people is not only about working on their external conditions. The first step of a successful transformation is to work on their mindsets, especially those of children and youth. We must not forget them, and their voices must be heard â?? the future belongs to them. Therefore, we must ensure that children today grow up to become citizens of the world with global mindsets. Everyone can be an agent of change. If people have a decent life and feel content with what they have, eventually they will want to give and share. Our role as Governments is to support people, create an environment that enables them to be able to give and share, and let people drive change.",1,196
7872,Session 72 - 2017,TJK_72_2017.txt,TJK_72_2017,72,2017,TJK,"I wish to join my colleagues, Heads of State and Government, in congratulating Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and to wish him every success in his noble duties. I also express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson for his continued support of Tajikistanâ??s national and international commitments during his term as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. Unprecedented rapid globalization over the past decades has contributed to the development of political and economic relationships among countries and helped bolster the integration of various regions across the world. It has also brought massive challenges to the worldâ??s people and sometimes undermines the efforts of Member States to ensure a safe, fair and secure life for their people. In this context, the United Nations, as a universal institution, should continue to carry out its noble mission of coordinating the efforts of Member States to strengthen countriesâ?? resilience in responding to modern threats and challenges. It is impossible to address the new challenges facing the international community without strengthening and reforming the entire United Nation system. Comprehensive and inclusive reform of the United Nations must contribute to increasing and strengthening its capacity to respond to developments around the world in a timely manner and to deal with todayâ??s threats and risks. United Nations reform should be implemented in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. We support the inclusive and equal representation of the interests of developing countries in the Security Council reform process. We are witnessing today many tragic and horrific events taking place across the globe that undermine the international communityâ??s commitment to attaining comprehensive sustainable development. The spread of terrorism and extremism, religious armed conflicts, transnational organized crime and drug trafficking pose serious challenges to the security of our countries. As terrorist and extremist groups and movements flourish in many hot spots throughout the world, threatening peopleâ??s security by using certain corners of the world as safe havens, I wish to reiterate that the horror and brutal acts of these forces have absolutely no connection with the holy religion of Islam. On the contrary, they run counter to the moral teachings and do not reflect the tolerance and values of Islam. In order to confront these threats, all Member States must make every effort, in accordance with international law, and avoid double standards. The Government of Tajikistan continues to take concrete steps to address threats and challenges and to ensure lasting peace and overall stability in the country, in cooperation with its partners and international organizations, in particular the relevant United Nations agencies. The implementation of the second phase of our National Strategy on Countering Extremism and Terrorism 2016-2020 is one effective instrument we use to fulfil our commitments. I should emphasize that these efforts are aimed at supporting the United Nations central coordinating role in assisting countries in post-conflict rehabilitation processes. The success of our joint actions to prevent and resolve conflict and to seek the peaceful settlement of disputes will depend first and foremost on how effectively we use preventive diplomacy and mediation. Peace and stability can ensure sustainable, inclusive cooperation aimed at resolving the conflict in North Korea. Peace and stability can ensure sustainable social and economic development and a more peaceful life, and create conditions conducive to a strong civil society and to respect for and the protection of human rights in all countries, facilitating the prosperity of Member States. We Tajiks are well aware of the importance of peace and the need to defend it, since our people have experienced many hardships and suffered through a civil war in the early days of its independence. As a result of the domestic conflict imposed upon them, thousands of our nationals lost their lives. Only through peace and stability have we been able to achieve sustainable economic development, reduce poverty and improve our peopleâ??s well-being, promote cooperation with different countries and goodwill among nations throughout the world, and take the measures necessary to ensure regional integration. We cannot afford to remain silent in the face of the military, political, social and economic situation in neighbouring Afghanistan. The rapidly growing activity of violent terrorist groups in the country has become a source of serious concern for us. Given the current situation in that country, it is high time to take strong measures to coordinate counter-terrorism efforts and tackle drug production and trafficking in narcotics. Tajikistan supports Afghanistanâ??s comprehensive conflict resolution strategy. The Government and the people of Afghanistan need timely support and targeted assistance, especially during the current transition period. Tajikistanâ??s involvement in the process of regional integration through enhanced economic and trade relations with that country could be an important element in helping the country move forward towards peace and stability. We call on the international community to stand with and contribute to helping Afghanistan restore its ailing social and economic life and to develop its transport and communication infrastructure. Tajikistan, which has 1,400 kilometres of border with Afghanistan, stands ready and committed to contribute to these noble objectives. Transport and road links between our countries and the implementation of the power-transmission lines projects, including the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000), as well as the training and professional development of experts in different areas, are among the projects that we are carrying out with that country. Fighting drug trafficking, which is one of the main sources of funding of international terrorism, calls for the joint effort and strong will of the international community to help the country get rid of this evil. Tajikistan has established cooperation with the relevant United Nations agencies, regional organizations and partner countries at the bilateral level. We are currently successfully implementing our National Strategy on Combating Illicit Drugs 2013-2020. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the international community was a key milestone in our joint work to advance sustainable development and involve all sectors of society in the process. Over the past few years, Tajikistan has made great strides towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Government of my country, in close and effective cooperation with the relevant United Nations agencies, has developed and adopted the Mid-Term Development Strategy 2020 and the National Development Strategy 2016-2030. These strategies have been developed in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and we believe that their timely and effective implementation will contribute to achieving the Agenda. Tajikistan was among 43 countries that presented their voluntary national review in July at the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, in New York. To achieve the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda, it is necessary to help the least developed countries and developing countries, particularly by providing financial support and cutting-edge technologies, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It is worth mentioning that the geographical situation of landlocked developing countries and their lack of access to sea ports are serious obstacles to honouring their commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Countries in these circumstances need much more assistance from developed countries and international financial institutions in their efforts to develop infrastructure, improve transport systems and simplify trade policies and regional integration. The specialized institutions and agencies of the United Nations, particularly the Economic and Social Council, can and should have an important role in this regard. We believe that the more attention we give to economic, social and environmental issues, the better we can contribute to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. That would also help countries to cope with their social challenges and improve the livelihood and living standards of their people by providing jobs. We, the representatives of the international community, adopted the Paris Agreement on Climate Change two years ago. The goals enshrined in that critical document determine the major obligations and efforts of the international community in reducing carbon dioxode emissions in the atmosphere, adaptation to climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Climate change accelerates the melting of glaciers, which affects the rise of the water level in rivers and negatively affects certain sectors of the national economy. With 93 per cent of its territory surrounded by mountains, Tajikistan, owing to its geographical location, faces the devastating consequences of climate change and natural disasters. Every year, the country suffers from natural disasters, including those related to water. Tajikistan spends hundreds of millions of dollars to tackle and eliminate the consequences of natural disasters. Over the past 30 years, Tajikistan has lost more than 1,000 of its 13,000 glaciers due to melting as a result of climate change and temperature rise. This comes at a time when the industrial capability of Tajikistan, which is the main source of its carbon dioxide emissions, is not especially large. Ninety-eight per cent of the countryâ??s energy is produced by hydroelectric power stations, generating environmentally friendly energy. Over 60 per cent of Central Asian water resources are currently formed in Tajikistan. It is obvious that the accelerated melting of glaciers adversely affects water levels in the region. In this regard, the time has come for us to turn our words into actions and demonstrate our resolve to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement. In our view, one way to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement is to adhere to the green economy recommmendations and promote the comprehensive use of renewable energy sources. In this context, we express our full support of the international Sustainable Energy for All initiative and the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All 2014-2024. It is important for the international community to make vigorous efforts to achieve these goals. Tajikistan is strongly committed to maintaining its contribution to implementing the water-related goals of the 2030 Agenda. It is with great pleasure that I note that, in December 2016, the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 71/222, entitled â??International Decade for Action, â??Water for Sustainable Developmentâ??, 2018-2028â??. We believe that the implementation of the new Decade at the national, regional and international levels will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to water and help to preserve that invaluable resource for generations to come. This morning we conducted a high-level side event entitled â??Towards Implementation of the International Decade of Action, â??Water for Sustainable Developmentâ??, 2018-2028â??, at which participants exchanged views on ways and means to implement the new international Decade and Sustainable Development Goal 6. Furthermore, in order to review and deliberate on proposals by development partners and with a view to adopting a road map for the Decade, we intend to organize, on 22 March 2018, World Water Day, a special event in New York to celebrate the launch of the international Decade and to host a high-level international conference on water for sustainable development in Dushanbe next June. We strongly believe that the States Members of the United Nations, international and regional organizations, international financial institutions, civil society, think- tank associations, women and youth will stand together and work to achieve the Decadeâ??s goals and objectives for the sake of the lives of people around the globe and to ensure a better future for coming generations.",1,196
7873,Session 72 - 2017,TKM_72_2017.txt,TKM_72_2017,72,2017,TKM,"Allow me to convey greetings and wishes for peace and prosperity to the peoples of the member States represented here from the President of Turkmenistan, His Excellency Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. I congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on his important election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and I wish him success in his forthcoming work. I would also like to commend Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session, for his active and effective activities in that position. Guaranteeing international peace and security and protecting the legal and institutional foundations that are at the basis of the modern world order are the main task of the countries of the United Nations and of the largest international organizations, and that requires of them closer and more coordinated cooperation. The degree of effectiveness of such cooperation will in its turn largely determine the success of solutions to other global problems, including the environment, energy and food-related issues, combating terrorism, drug trafficking and other challenges. Today the effective and uncompromising struggle against terrorism has become the imperative of global development. It is clear that terrorism in all its forms is a deliberate challenge to the civilized world. In point of fact, terrorism as a phenomenon threatens to undermine the entire system of global security and its political and moral foundations. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and recognize that the prevention of terrorism is one of the most important components of ensuring national, regional and global security. We welcome the important role of the United Nations in international efforts to combat terrorism. Supporting the efforts of the world community to create effective international counter-terrorism mechanisms. Turkmenistan therefore advocates the full implementation of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy. We believe that such work should be carried out everywhere â?? at the global, regional and national levels. In that connection, we welcome the establishment of United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, and we are ready to cooperate actively to further implement the Ashgabat Declaration, which was adopted at the outcome of the Central Asia-United Nations High-level Dialogue on Implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia, held on 13 June 2017 in Turkmenistan. Noting the role of preventive diplomacy in preventing conflicts, eliminating the causes that lead to conflict, establishing an atmosphere of trust among countries and creating positive conditions for effective cooperation among States on political, diplomatic, economic, social, environmental and other issues, Turkmenistan attaches particular importance to the activities of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia that are aimed at achieving those objectives in the Central Asian region. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Regional Centre. Turkmenistan, together with Central Asian countries, intends to submit to the First Committee a draft resolution on supporting preventive diplomacy mechanisms in addressing urgent problems with the intention of supporting peace and security. The conditions in the world and new challenges and threats to humankind dictate the need to reform the United Nations and to review its working methods in order to strengthen its timeliness and its ability to react to those threats. We support reforms and also the efforts of the Secretary-General in that regard. The implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is one of the key areas of our countryâ??s strategic cooperation with the United Nations. As a result of the comprehensive work that had been carried out jointly with the United Nations since October 2015 at the governmental level, the 17 Goals, 148 targets and 193 indicators of the SDGs were selected and adopted. To coordinate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals within the country, we have established a national mechanism for SDG implementation. To organize training in the methodology related to issues of implementing the SDGs at the national, regional and international levels, we have opened a training and methodological centre within the Institute of International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan, recognizing the importance of sport as a key factor for guaranteeing peace and sustainable development, again states its commitment to strengthening international sports cooperation.Currently, in Ashgabat, the fifth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games are being held, with the participation of national teams from 65 countries, including 19 countries of Oceania, which are participating for the first time. Expressing our firm commitment to the provisions of resolution 70/1, of 25 September 2015, entitled â??Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developmentâ??, and recognizing the increasing role that sport plays in broadening the rights and opportunities of individuals and communities, Turkmenistan has initiated the participation of the refugee Olympic team in competitions, thereby reaffirming our countryâ??s commitment to the ideals of humanism, goodness, fairness and progress as anchored in the Charter of the United Nations. We express our thanks to all countries for their support for the initiative of Turkmenistan and Brazil in that regard and for the adoption of the Joint Statement on Encouraging the Valuable Contribution of the Olympic Teams of Refugees to the Promotion of Peace and Human Rights at the thirty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council, on 15 September in Geneva. Pursuant to the Final Declaration of the International Sports Congress, entitled â??Asian Games 2017: International Sport Cooperation for Peace and Developmentâ??, published as an official document of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session (A/71/878, annex), Turkmenistan reaffirms its proposal to host, under the auspices of UNESCO, the seventh International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport. Cooperation in the area of transport is a priority for our country in working with the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Turkmenistan will continue to actively support the implementation of the decisions of the international community, in particular resolutions 69/213, of 2014, and 70/197, of 2015, aimed at forming new international transport and transit corridors and updating existing ones. As an important step towards the implementation of those documents, the Government of Turkmenistan suggested holding the first United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conference, which took place in Ashgabat in November 2016, and welcomed the participation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Recalling that the Ashgabat Statement on Commitments and Policy Recommendations was adopted at the end of the Conference, and with the aim of successfully implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Turkmenistan intends to submit to the Second Committee at the current session a draft resolution on strengthening the links between all modes of transport to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Ensuring sustainable and fair access to energy resources is one of the main tasks on the global 2030 Agenda. This year our country will chair the international Energy Charter Conference. In line with the plans for our chairmanship, Turkmenistan has this year undertaken a range of measures to revitalize the process of developing new international legal mechanisms in the field of sustainable energy. In that context, we welcome the creation of an international expert group on energy security and sustainable energy and invite States to take active part in the work of the Energy Charter Conference, which will be held on 28 and 29 November in Ashgabat. One of our main objectives is to participate actively in international efforts to deal with the most important issues of environmental protection, including the management of water resources. In the light of Turkmenistanâ??s chairmanship of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), we propose holding a summit in 2018 in Turkmenistan, with the Heads of the Founder States of IFAS, which would include the participation of specialized international structures such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We once again state our countryâ??s readiness to seek out new approaches and ways to overcome the challenges faced by humankind and reaffirm our firm commitment to cooperation with the United Nations, which was and remains a strategic priority and a practical foundation for all of our activities in the international arena.",1,196
7874,Session 72 - 2017,TLS_72_2017.txt,TLS_72_2017,72,2017,TLS,"I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Francisco Guterres Lu-Olo, President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. â??At the outset, I would like to congratulate President Miroslav Lajcak on his election and wish him every success in carrying out his duties. I welcome the theme of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are without a doubt the tasks of our generation. I am confident that the Presidentâ??s capable leadership, together with that of Secretary- General Antonio Guterres, will encourage and inspire our strong commitment and help us succeed in our common objective. â??It is a happy coincidence that I have been given the opportunity to address the General Assembly today, the same day on which, 18 years ago, the first members of the International Force in East Timor arrived in my country from Australia and New Zealand. The arrival on 20 September 1999 of that United Nations-mandated Force paved the way for our attainment of national independence, which a majority of the Timorese people voted for in a referendum on self-determination held under United Nations supervision. On behalf of the Timorese people, I reiterate my gratitude to the United Nations and to all the civilians and military officers under the flag of the United Nations who protect innocent people and save lives. â??Another happy coincidence is that there is another key player in the process that led to the self-determination of the Timorese people among us today â?? Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The determined efforts of Mr. Guterres, then Prime Minister of Portugal, guided by his values and ethical imperatives, were decisive in ensuring that today Timor-Leste is considered a joint success story for the Timorese people and the United Nations. â??The history of Timor-Leste is a vivid reminder that when the values of civilization, on which the very existence of the United Nations is founded, lead us and inspire our decisions on the international scene, the United Nations and international law become powerful and decisive forces for settling conflicts and restoring peace. This year Timor- Leste is celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the restoration of its independence, on 20 May 2002. Over the past 15 years, the partnerships we have established with the United Nations and its specialized agencies and development partners have produced important and inspiring results. We have achieved what few thought possible. â??The mortality rates of children under the age of 5 have fallen by half. According to the World Health Organization, Timor-Leste succeeded in reducing malaria rates from 220 out of 1,000 cases in 2006 to one in 1,000 in 2012. In 2002 there were 19 doctors in Timor-Leste; today we have nearly 1,000, trained thanks to the cooperation and solidarity of the people and the Government of Cuba. We have doctors in every village and several new hospitals. My country has been declared leprosy-free by the World Health Organization for the first time in centuries. In 2002, life expectancy at birth was 60 years; today it has reached 68.5. â??We consider education, like health care, a key priority. Our primary-education enrolment rates stand at nearly 100 per cent of school-age children and youth. We have recently introduced a new curriculum at the primary-school level and we given special priority in the past few years to building new schools and improving school equipment, with the primary objective of these and many other measures being improving the quality of public schools. â??The progress we have made is reflected in the United Nations Development Programmeâ??s Human Development Index, in which our score during the past six years has averaged 0.610. In 2002, it was 0.375. â??The State of Timor-Leste has also undertaken initiatives to increase womenâ??s participation in and contribution to the process of social and economic development, including by enacting legal measures against discrimination. Many East Timorese women occupy important positions in Government, the justice system, other public institutions and civil society. A third of the members of Timor- Lesteâ??s national Parliament are women. However, ensuring that women are protected against exploitation and violence, as well as giving full recognition to their role in society, still requires the Governmentâ??s attention. â??The Timorese peopleâ??s most important achievement during the past 15 years has been in building peace and reconciliation at both the national and international levels. Peace and reconciliation have been made possible thanks to the vision of our national leaders and the courage of Timorese society as a whole to reject vengeance and genuinely adhere to that vision. â??We have established solid relations of friendship and close cooperation with Indonesia and Australia. We are working to further strengthen our relations with our neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to which we have submitted our application for membership. Strengthening Timor-Lesteâ??s regional integration is a key priority of our foreign policy.â??In Timor-Leste, now that peace and stability have been achieved, we are putting our efforts into creating better conditions for economic and social development. In particular, we have improved development conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises and the private sector, and we are promoting the diversification of the non-oil economy. This year we also strengthened democracy through our most recent presidential and legislative elections, which were organized entirely by the Timorese people. â??We believe that a key condition for the development of the country is ensuring stable and solid institutions that provide quality public services. This is why my country supported the inclusion in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions. We believe that there can be no development without peace, and the importance of peace for development is a priority for us that has been reflected in Timor- Lesteâ??s commitment to establishing the g7+ since 2009. The g7+ brings together a couple of dozen States that are emerging from conflict or in a situation of fragility. The Groupâ??s action has had tangible, positive results in relationships with development partners and in bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We have seen these mutual advantages in the cooperation that has resulted among fragile States in relevant areas such as peace and reconciliation, the management of natural resources and the stewardship of public finances. Many of the member States of the g7+ have also hosted or are hosting United Nations peacekeeping missions, putting them in the privileged position of being able to share their valuable experience with regard to areas of peacekeeping that have been successful and those that need improvement. â??Our national experience has taught us to value multilateralism as an important instrument for responding to challenges within the international system, but that is not the only reason we value it. Another is the 2030 Agenda, which embodies multilateralismâ??s potential for improving the planet and the well-being of its peoples. The 2030 Agenda has benefited from the overall experience of the process of the Millennium Development Goals, and its success will benefit the many millions who have been deprived of basic human rights through poverty. Only through dialogue, negotiation, multilateral cooperation and respect for democracy can we meet the ambitious goals we have established for 2030. â??Today the international community is facing unprecedented challenge that require multilateral cooperation and a global response. Climate change is already having a growing impact on the development conditions for society and on the future of the planet. The effect on food security, among other things, is central to our concerns and has been the target of several Government measures, including within the scope of multilateral cooperation in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, which we recently had the honour of presidi ng over. For small island developing States, the effects of climate change represent an existential issue that requires attention and effort from us all. â??International cooperation in the fight against transnational crime at all levels is a top priority for Timor-Leste. We, the international community, have an inalienable duty to work to realize the values of civilization enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and its conventions. Timor-Leste is a participant in a number of important multilateral processes for regional and international stability and security, and we will continue to expand and deepen that participation. â??The world is facing threats that were unimaginable when the United Nations was first established. The Organization must be capable of responding to the new challenges facing humankind. In that context, I would like to express Timor- Lesteâ??s full support for the ongoing reform process led by the Secretary-General, particularly with regard to the United Nations development system and its management of areas such as peacekeeping, security, gender parity and strategies against sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as his recent establishment of a High-level Advisory Board on Mediation and the Office of Counter-Terrorism â??The world is currently confronting two huge threats to international peace, the hotbeds of war in the Middle East and the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula and escalating tensions there. My country urges all the parties involved, in both regions, to show the greatest possible restraint inorder to avoid any steps that could aggravate the situation. Timor-Leste calls on all the parties to fully respect the relevant international conventions and Security Council resolutions. In particular, I call for dialogue and negotiation to help defuse the tensions and promote a peaceful settlement of the conflict on the Korean peninsula. Timor- Leste supports non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and is in the process of signing and ratifying the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which it expects to conclude in the near future. â??My country welcomes the prospect of the holding of an intergovernmental conference on migration next year and considers it urgent to improve the coordination of the international community and the quality of the shelter for these massive movements of migrants and refugees. We must also tackle the root of the problem by increasing development opportunities in depressed regions and reducing the drivers of migration flows. â??Ensuring that the people of Western Sahara can finally exercise their right to self-determination continues to be postponed. For 26 years, the Sahrawi have been peacefully waiting for the parties to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions. I call for dialogue between the Kingdom of Morocco, the legitimate representatives of the Sahrawi people and the United Nations aimed at arriving at a solution as soon as possible that can ensure the holding of a referendum on the self- determination of the people of Western Sahara. I also call for the lifting of the embargo on the Republic of Cuba, an anachronistic situation that the international community has broadly rejected. â??I am very pleased to inform the General Assembly that Timor-Leste and Australia have made important and decisive progress in the talks on the demarcation of our shared maritime border. Timor- Leste initiated the settlement process required under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in April of last year. This mechanism, initiated for the first time in history, has enabled both countries to recently agree in principle on the central elements of the delimitation of the maritime borders of the Timor Sea. It has reaffirmed our faith in the ability of the international legal system, and in particular the United Nations, to support all States. We want to point out that thanks to the United Nations and its procedures, it will now be possible for us to take one of our final steps towards achieving full sovereignty. We also hope that in these times of global complexity and uncertainty, our success in that process will set a small but positive example for the international community. â??In conclusion, I would like to emphasize Timor-Lesteâ??s commitment to the multilateral system. Timor-Leste will continue to cooperate closely and at every level with efforts to maintain regional and international security and stability. Our people greatly appreciate the support of the international community.â??",1,196

In contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including the internationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS) and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, Tonga has established a national monitoring mechanism, for which we would like to acknowledge the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2013-2017 will conclude at the end of this year. The five-year programme cycle for 14 Pacific island countries, the United Nations Pacific Strategy 2018- 2022, which was signed in August 2017 at the UNDP Pacific Office, will commence after that. The close partnership between the Government of Tonga and the United Nations system for effectively implementing the integrated Tonga strategic development framework and the 2030 Agenda is reinforced, through the coordination of United Nations Pacific Strategy 2018-2022, by the United Nations Joint Presence Office delivering as one, led by UNDP in Tonga. It is strategically positioned to provide technical advice to the Government, non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector. We also note the Secretary-Generalâ??s new senior-management appointments and welcome the appointment of the first woman from Tonga and the Pacific islands region to shepherd the important advocacy and facilitation work in the years ahead for the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. We fully support the goal of gender parity, including at all levels in the Organization. The 2017 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development enabled us to review seven of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal 3, on good health and well-being; Goal 5 on gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and Goal 14 on the ocean and its resources. We commend the President of the Economic and Social Council for his initiative in devoting adequate time to underscore and examine the complex sustainability challenges facing SIDS, as a special case, and thereby enhancing efforts to implement the commitments called for in the Samoa Pathway. The High-level Political Forum remains an important way to assess the follow-up, monitoring and accountability of commitments to SIDS, which are essentially linked to the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We fully support Fijiâ??s presidency this year of the twenty-third Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with a view to strongly addressing the adverse impacts of climate change and the urgent need for innovation in adaptation for SIDS. We note the role of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank in making disaster finance and other financial tools available to all SIDS. While we acknowledge their work on expanding the definition of fragility, we urge for further refinement of operational financing decisions so as to include the drivers of vulnerability that the Pacific islands region experiences, particularly natural disasters and adverse economic shocks. We reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative for climate and security to ensure that the United Nations system has the appropriate tools to respond effectively and efficiently to climate change as an existential threat and a mounting security challenge for SIDS and the entire international community. Enhanced access to modern and clean sustainable-energy services, energy efficiency and the use of economically viable and environmentally sound technology and research play a critical role in our sustainable development. Mitigation efforts are also essential to overcoming the challenges of excessive dependence on imported fossil fuels. To further strengthen international and regional cooperation, the Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency was established in Tonga in April. The Centre provides valuable support to Pacific island countries and territories in advancing their various priorities and commitments in achieving sustainable energy and contributing to SDGs 7, 9 and 13. It is a partnership that includes the Pacific Community, the Government of Austria, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative, among others. The General Assembly acknowledged the Centre at its adoption in July of the biennial resolution entitled â??Cooperation between the United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forumâ?? (resolution 71/316). However, we continue to experience the negative effects of ocean degradation on our livelihoods and culture, owing to anthropogenic activities and the devastating interrelated effects of climate change. We are already actively contributing to the implementation of SDG 14, and look forward to a strong collaboration with all interested parties. This year we hosted an international whaling meeting. Through a far-sighted royal decree in 1978, His Majesty the late King Tupou IV had already banned whaling in Tongan waters four years before the international ban on whale hunting came into effect. That was reaffirmed during the April 2017 international conference on â??Whales in a changing oceanâ?? that we were honoured to host. We may be a small island State, but all small island developing States are large-ocean States. For us and our people, the successful implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 is critical to our pathway towards sustainable development and its interconnection with other goals, such as those related to food security, water and sanitation, health, economic growth, and sustainable production and consumption. We need strong political will for a whole-of-Government approach to mainstreaming ocean-related actions from international, regional, and national development plans and strategies, in order to ensure the inclusive participation and efforts of all stakeholders, including local communities and the private sector. Tonga joined the international community in endorsing the call-for-action outcome document (resolution 71/312) of the Ocean Conference in June, which includes almost 1,400 voluntary commitments by stakeholders, including eight from Tonga. It is a foundation for the development of a blue economy or â??blue charterâ??, as proposed by the Commonwealth secretariat. It is urgent that we begin working to develop practical guidelines and toolkits to assist States in delivering on all the targets under Goal 14 in an integrated manner. We acknowledge the completion of the work of the Preparatory Committee established by General Assembly resolution 69/292 on the development of a legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Tonga maintains its support for the commencement of an intergovernmental conference to initiate negotiations on a substantive text as soon as possible. We embrace the ongoing work of the International Seabed Authority in its administration and management of resources in that area in accordance with the common heritage of mankind. Tonga congratulates the Secretary-General of the Authority in his first year in office as he works with member States to develop important exploitation regulations, which must strike the appropriate balance between conservation of the natural environment in which mineral resources exist and its sustainable use. The consultations must be transparent and inclusive if such a balance is to be achieved. Tonga continues its engagement as a member State of the Authority and will seek re-election to the Council at the Authorityâ??s twenty-fourth session in 2018. A Tongan national, together with other members of the Legal and Technical Commission, provides expert views for facilitating the work of the Commission in developing an important financial mechanism for ensuring the fair and equitable distribution of returns from seabed mining. Tonga reiterates the call made under the Samoa Pathway for genuine and durable partnerships that can help to ensure that no one is left behind. A very credible partnership mechanism between the 12 Pacific SIDS and Italy, Austria, Luxembourg and Spain is exemplified through the Joint Committee. It has been ably co-chaired by Italy and the Chair of the Pacific SIDS every year since 2006. Tonga has therefore benefited thanks to projects related to renewable energy, water, the strengthening of young Government officialsâ?? capacities and, more recently, protected maritime areas. We welcome the establishment of the India-United Nations Development Fund through the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, which launched a project implemented by UNDP for establishing early warning systems in Tonga and other Pacific island countries. The system relies on the timely provision of disaster-risk information, guidance on how to act on warnings and ensuring a constant state of preparedness. Sustainable development is possible where there is peace and security, and sustainable development is key to peace and security. Finally, we urge all leaders to focus and reflect on the best ways to ensure that their power and legitimacy can benefit their own people and the entire world. We appeal for a speedy resolution to the current tensions on the Korean peninsula, which are affecting global peace and security. I congratulate the Secretary-General on the recent establishment of the High-level Advisory Board for Mediation, designed to advise him on specific initiatives and related efforts around the world. May Almighty God guide and bless the President of the General Assembly, all the States Members of the United Nations and their respective Governments and peoples.",1,196
7876,Session 72 - 2017,TTO_72_2017.txt,TTO_72_2017,72,2017,TTO,"Each year, as a community of nations, we gather together to reaffirm the possibilities and potential arising from our resolve that finding solutions to the many challenges facing our planet can best be achieved through our collective action and shared dialogue and by striving for peace and a decent life for all peoples. On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I am honoured and delighted to address the Assembly today. I extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We are confident that he will discharge his mandate with efficiency and impartiality for the benefit of all nations. He has the support of our delegation. I also seize this opportunity to convey thanks and best wishes to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, former President of the General Assembly, for his hard work, commitment and leadership during the seventy- first session. Once again, I extend congratulations to His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his assumption of the position of Secretary-General. We wish to encourage and commend his direction and guidance in steering us forward. From shifting weather patterns to global warming to sea-level rise, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. In our region, we have witnessed the catastrophic effects of Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Maria, which have undoubtedly changed forever lives in several of our Caribbean countries, leaving some islands almost uninhabitable and resulting in many untimely deaths. The recent earthquake in Mexico and hurricanes in the United States ought to be counted within the realm of the recent global disasters. Trinidad and Tobago, which is in the southernmost part of the Caribbean, was spared from the ravages of these hurricanes. It is with empathy that I extend, on behalf of the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago, heartfelt condolences to our Caribbean family. We are forever mindful that, given our spirit of resilience, we will rebuild that which was lost. Trinidad and Tobago stands in solidarity with the affected countries and will continue to assist with relief efforts. However, rebuilding will require resources, as well as the cooperation and collaboration of the international community, because we simply cannot do it alone. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago joins with other Caribbean Community Governments in expressing our gratitude for the tremendous generosity and support provided in face of the regionâ??s most urgent need. Our thanks and appreciation also go out to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), the regionâ??s first responder. However, CDEMA will need additional resources and funding to enable it to do even more to facilitate its immediate responses to natural disaster. In the face of the recent natural catastrophes, how can one deny the scientific findings that climate change is real and that it is here and indeed upon us? The events of the past months in the Caribbean remind us all once more that small island developing States (SIDS) remain at the forefront of the impact of climate change. We cannot by any means continue with the same approach, as natureâ??s fury holds no prejudice. Yet, in the light of their categorization as high-income countries under the outdated formula of gross domestic product per capita, Caribbean countries will not qualify for aid and development assistance in their time of need. I join my Caribbean colleagues in calling for a multidimensional approach that takes into consideration real national needs and priorities and takes these extraordinary circumstances into account in order to provide access to development assistance, aid and debt relief as the Caribbean region collectively embarks together on the arduous task of recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. In order to achieve human and global sustainable development, we must treat unmitigated climate change and global temperature rise as a priority issue. Trinidad and Tobago is doing its part and remains committed to achieving the overarching objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Through our nationally determined contribution, Trinidad and Tobago has indicated its intention to reduce by December 2030 greenhouse-gas emissions in its public- transportation sector by 30 per cent, in comparison with 2013 levels. Trinidad and Tobago has therefore framed its national development plan for the period 2016-2030, entitled Vision 2030, with a thematic focus of â??Many hearts, many voices, one visionâ??, in keeping with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this context, we have mapped our national development goals in accordance with global priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Trinidad and Tobago and the United Nations signed the Multi-country Sustainable Development Framework in April. We acknowledge and thank the United Nations Development Programme for its assistance with these activities. We are also pleased that the recently completed quadrennial comprehensive policy review has initiated a recalibration of the United Nations development system. This would better support developing countries, including SIDS, in the implementation of the programmes of action, including the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the 2030 Agenda. In alignment with the quadrennial comprehensive policy review and the Secretary- Generalâ??s reform proposals, Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to ensuring that the United Nations development system adopts a more flexible and tailored approach to sustainable development assistance to assist countries in implementing the SDGs in a focused, coordinated, coherent and cost-effective manner. Oceans cover three quarters of the Earthâ??s surface and contain more than 95 per cent of the Earthâ??s water. It is therefore indisputable that promoting the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources is of critical importance to sustainable development and the survival of all humankind. Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the progress achieved at the recently concluded Oceans Conference in June and the adoption of the historic call for action, as well as the commitments and actions to be taken by Member States to safeguard the health of the oceans through the implementation of SDG 14. As a small island developing State, Trinidad and Tobago is highly vulnerable to the unprecedented rate of loss of marine biodiversity and the impacts of unsustainable practices on the marine environment. Consequently, we welcome the adoption of the recommendations of the Preparatory Committee established pursuant to resolution 69/292, on the development of a legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Notably, this agreement will seek to address existing regulatory and legal gaps and ensure that the resources of our oceans are properly conserved and managed for the benefit of present and future generations After two years of having the Preparatory Committee and about 10 years of negotiations, we believe that the time is long overdue for us to translate words into action. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks forward to the convening of an intergovernmental conference in 2018 to consider the recommendations of the Preparatory Committee on the elements and to elaborate the text of an international legally binding instrument under the Convention. The Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all citizens and residents without discrimination based on race, origin, colour, religion or sex. Our Government accords high priority to achieving gender equality and the empowerment and advancement of women, who are pivotal to the achievement of the SDGs. In the words of the Secretary-General, â??Womenâ??s rights are indeed human rightsâ??. One cannot overstate the importance of protecting the rights of women and ensuring their full participation on an equal basis with men. In placing women at the forefront of our development, it should be noted that a Trinidad and Tobago national is one of two women who sit on the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which comprises 20 members. With regard to the advancement of girls, the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago recently passed the Miscellaneous Provisions (Marriage) Bill. This bill provides for outlawing child marriage in Trinidad and Tobago by raising the legal age of marriage to 18 years. We are currently witnessing unprecedented levels of displacement in the world. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, approximately 65.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes. This amounts to nearly 22.5 million refugees. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago considers it important to develop ways to effectively manage migration and to take the necessary steps to enable the process of mainstreaming migration into development planning. We have therefore sought to make the necessary policy changes and to participate in projects and training in order to develop the necessary tools to mainstream migration into development planning. Trinidad and Tobago was among the 122 States that voted in favour of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted on 7 July. The Treaty is particularly significant as it is the first multilateral legally binding instrument for nuclear disarmament to have been negotiated in 20 years. We look forward to the convening of the high-level conference on nuclear disarmament by 2018. As a small island developing State, Trinidad and Tobago actively participated in the negotiations to prohibit nuclear weapons, as it is acutely aware of the destructive force of these weapons of mass destruction to, inter alia, human life, the environment, food security, infrastructure and economic growth. In view of the continued prevalence and negative effects of illegal small arms and light weapons, including the issue of curbing such weapons and its ammunition, Trinidad and Tobago has played leading roles in a number of United Nations initiatives, such as the Arms Trade Treaty. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons has contributed significantly to violence and instability in our region. The Arms Trade Treaty remains a key priority for Trinidad and Tobago as it seeks to regulate the illegal transfer of small arms and light weapons and ammunition. I wish to reiterate to the Assembly the Government of Trinidad and Tobagoâ??s unequivocal commitment and unceasing call for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. We remain optimistic that there will be a diplomatic solution to finding an end to this long-standing issue and that in good faith the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba, which significantly challenges its achievement of sustainable development, will be lifted soon. We remain fully committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and in particular to the principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and navigation. To this end, Trinidad and Tobago consistently supports subregional, regional and international efforts to promote constructive dialogue to bring about the cessation, sooner rather than later, of the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. Adherence to the rule of law is important to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 16, which seeks to promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and to ensure equal access to justice for all, as it is one of the pillars for promoting sustainable development. Trinidad and Tobago, as a democratic society, adheres to the rule of law and the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. As such, we uphold the importance of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect for human rights and achieving sustainable peace and development, in accordance with international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As a country which has been credited as one of the forefathers of the ICC through the pioneering work of the late Arthur N. R. Robinson, former Prime Minister and President of Trinidad and Tobago, we remain resolute in our commitment to supporting the mandate of the ICC and its primary objective to help put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, as well as to prevent such heinous crimes. In conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago is particularly pleased with the Presidentâ??s choice of theme for the seventy-second session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. We believe that these concerns and issues are timely and necessary, especially as we are faced with increasing humanitarian challenges, threats to international peace and security, as well as the environment. In harmony with the global vision for multilateralism, we are committed to working together collectively to find enduring and sustainable solutions to global disparities, poverty, rising inequality, protracted conflicts and other challenges facing the world today. We must all do our part in this noble endeavour for the good of humankind.",1,196
7877,Session 72 - 2017,TUN_72_2017.txt,TUN_72_2017,72,2017,TUN,"I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and wish him every success in his tasks. I thank Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for his efforts to advance the lofty United Nations principles by promoting the pivotal role of our Organization, maintaining international peace and security, and promoting sustainable development. I cannot fail to commend the efforts of Mr. Peter Thomson as President of the General Assembly at its previous session, particularly with regard to the implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The theme of this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is in line with the priorities of the Tunisian Government for the coming period. In that respect, Tunisia has, since 2011, made great strides towards democratization and in promoting the rule of law and State institutions. That includes adopting a Constitution that promotes the values of democracy, human rights, womenâ??s rights and youth rights. We also held our first fair and transparent legislative and presidential elections in 2014. As a young democracy, we are pursuing measures aimed at strengthening constitutional institutions and structural reforms at all levels, in accordance with a clear vision and consensus that include all components of Tunisian society. Achieving development, fighting corruption, promoting investment and reducing unemployment, as well as promoting good governance, while focusing at the same time on combating the scourge of terrorism and extremism, have presented many challenges on which we have focused our national capacities. We are confident that brotherly and friendly countries and the United Nations will continue supporting us in our efforts. We appreciate in particular the significant pledges made by many parties to support development in Tunisia at the International Conference to Support Tunisiaâ??s Economic, Social and Sustainable Development, Tunisia 2020, organized in Tunisia on 29 and 30 November 2016. I note that Tunisia, in its fight against terrorism, has had to redirect a significant portion of its resources originally allocated to development. We are confronting that scourge by doubling the budget for our military and security forces. Thanks to the unity of the Tunisian people â?? a society that is premised on justice, equality and openness â?? and their commitment to democracy, we have been able to combat terrorism and foil its schemes. That has enabled us to restore security and stability and improve many economic indicators in our country. Tunisia today is secure, like the majority of the countries in the world. It is endeavouring to promote its young democracy and its economy through significant reforms aimed at establishing a better business environment by attracting foreign investment and promoting tourism, as well as by seeking comprehensive development and meeting the needs and demands of our young people with regard to employment and a decent life. The scourge of terrorism derives its strength from proliferating hotbeds of tension, conflict and violent extremism. That exacerbates the challenges facing the international communityâ??s fight against that menace, which excludes no region and recognizes no borders. Terrorism is also linked to all types of organized crime, the influx of refugees and migrants, human trafficking and the consequent large-scale violations of universal human rights. Combating terrorism requires international cooperation and comprehensive and inclusive strategic partnership. We are confident that boosting the economy and development of our country, while working to ensure social peace and security, requires the active engagement of the international community at large in supporting our implementation of all the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular those that address environmental challenges, while mitigating the impacts of climate change on the economies of developing countries and the livelihoods of their people. We have therefore mainstreamed those goals in our national development plan for 2016-2020, and we have embarked upon implementing them in collaboration with the competent international agencies and regional structures â?? in particular the African Union, given the nexus between those goals and Agenda 2063 for African development. We are also preparing to release our first national report on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals for the consideration of the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In that respect, we would like to reiterate that it is important to take into account the priorities and specificities of each region and country when dealing with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Optimal utilization of all international and regional mechanisms, especially those dedicated to the financing of development, technology transfer and capacity-building, would support the efforts of African nations to achieve steady economic growth and sustainable development so as to put an end to poverty, marginalization and epidemics and work towards peaceful, just, inclusive and prosperous African communities. We believe that environmental considerations are important in achieving sustainable development for all the worldâ??s nations. We therefore signed the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, and we voluntarily committed to reducing our gas emissions by 41 per cent by 2030. Our commitment has also been demonstrated by the nationally determined contribution devoted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Tunisia upholds the principles of international legitimacy and supports all efforts aimed at maintaining international peace and security, in particular by strengthening our contributions to United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations. Therefore, efforts to promote the principles of justice and equality in international relations would benefit from improvements in the effectiveness of the United Nations work and its organs, in particular the Security Council, so that the Organization can better assume its crucial responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. The security and stability of the Arab region is an integral part of the worldâ??s stability. We therefore call for immediate political settlements of issues in our region, in particular the Palestine issue, which requires a comprehensive solution that brings justice to the Palestinian people, ends their suffering and enables them to recover their legitimate historical rights â?? especially the establishment of an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with international parameters and the Arab Peace Initiative. I seize this opportunity to reiterate our ongoing concern over the Libyan crisis, and we reiterate Tunisiaâ??s commitment to stand by our Libyan brethren and urge them to bridge their differences and swiftly find a comprehensive political settlement to the crisis there. Within the framework of our mediation efforts among Libyan protagonists, our President Essebsi launched an initiative in December 2016 for a comprehensive political settlement of the Libyan crisis. Tunisia, believing in the role of neighbouring countries, has been keen to ensure positive engagement with Algeria and Egypt on the issue, so that we join our efforts to help the Libyans to end their differences and proceed with the political solutions sponsored by the United Nations. It is important to unite international efforts on the Libyan situation, so that we can ensure progress on the political path and achieve convergence among Libyans under the supervision of the United Nations and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya. That is especially true given that our Organization is the guarantor for implementing commitments and is capable of adapting any amended agreement in accordance with Security Council resolutions. We seek in that connection to prevent any vacuum, which could worsen the anarchy and instability. We commend the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghassan SalamÃ©, and we support the road map that he put forward on the holding of the High-level Meeting on Libya on 20 September and his call for the Dialogue Committee â?? comprising the Libyan House of Representatives and the State High Council â?? to launch a new round of talks in Tunisia within the framework of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and, under his supervision, to introduce the consensual amendments to the Libyan Political Agreement of Skhirat. We hope that that step will act as a springboard for reconciliation and consensus in Libya. We reiterate today that it is important to reach a comprehensive and immediate political settlement to the situation in Syria, and we urge the Syrian parties to give priority to the vital interests of their nation with a view to reaching a consensus that preserves the unity and territorial integrity of Syria, putting an end to the catastrophic humanitarian tragedy endured by the Syrian people and addressing the serious ramifications of that conflict at the regional and international levels. We are gravely concerned at the exacerbation of the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen. That calls for redoubling international efforts to push forward political consultations aimed at finding a solution to that crisis in a manner that preserves the territorial integrity and resilience of the country, and puts an end to the humanitarian suffering endured by the Yemeni people. With regard to Iraq, we commend the fact that that brotherly country, in collaboration with the international coalition against Daâ??esh, has made significant progress in its war against terror. We reiterate Tunisiaâ??s solidarity with Iraq in combating that serious scourge. Regarding the situation of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, we reiterate our condemnation of the flagrant violations of human rights against that minority. We appeal to the international community to shoulder its responsibilities and to swiftly intervene to provide the necessary protection, ensure access to humanitarian assistance and save those people from the atrocities that they have been enduring. We are confronted with many serious challenges and issues, such as hotbeds of tension, conflicts, combating terrorism and extremists, addressing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, supporting human rights, implementing development goals and reforming the United Nations, among other crucial matters. The role of the United Nations is, thus, central in finding solutions to deal with those challenges. There is also a great responsibility that we need to bear in confronting the challenges caused by international transformations, for which we need to shore up our efforts. On this occasion, I would like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to develop the United Nations system, particularly with regard to the repositioning of the United Nations development system and the promotion of a preventive approach in resolving international conflicts and maintaining international peace and security. In conclusion, we reiterate Tunisiaâ??s resolve to continue to contribute actively to international action aimed at finding sound approaches and solutions to those difficult issues in a manner that preserves human dignity and enables the nations of the world to devote their efforts and resources to achieve comprehensive and sustainable development in a world of tolerance and intercultural solidarity among nations.",1,196
7878,Session 72 - 2017,TUR_72_2017.txt,TUR_72_2017,72,2017,TUR,"I greet the General Assembly with respect on behalf of myself and my country. I would like to thank Mr. Peter Thomson for his successful work over the past year as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k, who has assumed the presidency of the General Assembly. I hope that this yearâ??s session of the General Assembly, which has been convened under the theme â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, will bring well- being to all of the worldâ??s peoples. Unfortunately, global peace and stability have regressed further since our meeting in the Hall last year. We continue to see the ugly face of terror and war in different corners of the world. Terrorists, who are fuelled by an environment of conflict, continue their acts, spreading terror across different regions. We are anxiously observing the violent actions of radical currents converging on xenophobia, cultural racism and animosity against Islam. The most effective way of reversing this negative outlook would be to engage in sincere cooperation in the Hall. We need to develop a new perspective to promote world peace. No crisis or threat can possibly be resolved by allowing it to play out on its own. We all have to shoulder responsibility for a safer and more prosperous world. It is in that understanding that Turkey is pursuing an enterprising and humanitarian foreign policy. The Syrian conflict has entered its seventh year. This conflict has created deep wounds in the country, the region and throughout the world. In Syria, an entire civilization is being annihilated, together with civilians and innocent children. Terrorism, which is destroying the country and is fuelled by instability and oppression, is spreading like a cancer across borders. The Syrian people who took action demanding democracy, freedom, justice and a bright future were, unfortunately, abandoned by the international community. Turkey cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of these people, whom we see as our brothers and sisters regardless of their origin or creed and to whom we are connected by deep historical ties. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria in the spring of 2011, we have exerted all kinds of humanitarian and political efforts to solve the problem and we will continue to do so. We are currently hosting more than 3 million Syrians and over 200,000 Iraqis in our country. Together with Russia and Iran, we have launched the Astana meetings, with the participation of all parties to the conflict, in order to establish a permanent ceasefire and peace in the country. Following our initiatives, the Geneva process, which has long been blocked, has been revived. We are putting into practice a new plan to ensure the security of the Idlib region in Syria within the framework of the agreement reached in Astana. Turkey would support any step towards the construction of a stable and prosperous Syria, based on the territorial integrity of the country and on respect for the democratic demands of its people. We have taken and will continue to take all kinds of measures for those who came to our country with the outbreak of the Syrian crisis and to stem the influx of refugees into Europe. We meet all the needs of these people, from shelter to food and clothing and from health care to education, at standards that are appreciated by all those who visit our country. However, I would like to underscore that we have not received sufficient support from the international community, especially from the European Union, for our efforts. The expenditures of our public institutions, civil-society organizations and our people in order to meet the needs of those living in the camps and cities in Turkey have exceeded $30 billion. In response, the European Union has sent only â?¬820 million out of the â?¬3 billion + â?¬3 billion that it promised. The total assistance from the international community through the United Nations remains around $520 million. I should point out that no share of the assistance intended for the Syrians goes into our own budget; it is all delivered to those in need by the relief agencies through the relevant institutions of the United Nations. Before the whole world, I hereby call on the countries and international organizations that have placed the entire burden of the 3.2 million people on Turkeyâ??s shoulders to fulfil the promises they made. In fact, Turkey is a country that carries out humanitarian aid and development assistance activities around the world. Not only do we welcome those who come to our country, but through the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, the Turkish Disaster and Management Authority and the Turkish Red Crescent and various civil-society organizations we rush to the help of all who are suffering and under oppression, regardless of which part of the world they may be in. For example, through its official institutions and civil- society organizations, Turkey has spent $1 billion for the reconstruction of Somalia so far. The work we carry out and the results we have achieved in Somalia could indeed provide an example for similar efforts. According to confirmed statistics of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with $6 billion in humanitarian and development aid in 2016, Turkey ranked as the worldâ??s second-largest donor and top contributor in terms of gross national product. Yet, Turkey is the seventeenth-largest economy in the world. Having spent 0.8 per cent of its national income on humanitarian assistance, Turkey is one of the six countries that could meet the United Nations target. Therefore, Turkey is working diligently to achieve a sustainable world, which is the theme of this session of the General Assembly. We will continue in the coming days with the same consideration in mind. Turkey is engaged in an intense fight against the bloody terrorist organizations of the region, such as Daâ??esh and the Kurdish Workersâ?? Party, which are nourished by the instability in Syria and Iraq. In addition, our fight against the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, which attempted to change the legitimate and democratic regime of Turkey by a bloody coup, is also ongoing. We have recovered 243 residential areas and a tract of land larger than 2,000 kilometres thanks to Operation Euphrates Shield, initiated in Syria following the attacks by Daâ??esh on our borders. We neutralized almost 3,000 Daâ??esh militants during that operation. Around 100,000 Syrians returned to and resettled in the region we cleared of terrorists. Operation Euphrates Shield is the single greatest accomplishment against Daâ??esh since its occupation of the region. I must highlight the following fact before the Assembly. Most of the groups and forces claiming to be fighting Daâ??esh in the region in fact have no such goal. These groups and forces are using Daâ??esh as a pretext to realize their own agendas. The efforts of the Partiya Yekitiya Demokrat- Peopleâ??s Protection Units to change the demographic structure of the regions it has captured, to seize the property of the people and to kill or exile those who stand against it constitute a crime against humanity. If the fight against Daâ??esh is not waged on a legitimate basis, the world will certainly face the threat of new, Daâ??esh-like entities. Similar approaches exist in Iraq as well. Iraq also requires that compromises be reached on the basis of territorial integrity and the realization of the ideal of building a common future. Steps such as demands for independence that can cause fresh crises and conflicts in the region must be avoided. We hereby call on the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government to abort the initiative that it has launched in that direction. Ignoring the clear and determined stance of Turkey on this issue could lead to a process that would deprive the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government of even the opportunities they currently enjoy. We all should work on building tranquillity, peace, security and stability in the region instead of sparking new conflicts. In addition to Syria and Iraq, we are also closely following regions in Libya and in Yemen where terrorist organizations are trying to establish their influence. The international communityâ??s support for the legitimate Government of Libya will contribute significantly to the stability of the country. It should be kept in mind that if the mistakes made in Syria and Iraq were to be repeated in Libya, that would expose the entire world, particularly Europe, to much greater threats. Another issue on which Turkey places special emphasis is the immediate resolution of the conflict that has erupted in the Gulf region. We believe that the sanctions that are negatively affecting the living conditions of the Qatari people should be lifted forthwith. We support the mediation efforts of the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, to resolve the crisis. Our hope is that these efforts will yield positive results. We also hope that Saudi Arabia, which we see as the elder brother of the Gulf region, will show a sincere will to resolve this issue. Another important problem is the issue of Palestine, which we consider to be the gaping wound of the world, and, by extension, the preservation of the historical status of Jerusalem and Al-Haram Al-Sharif, that is, the Temple Mount. The crisis in Al-Haram Al-Sharif in July demonstrated the sensitivity of the issue. The continuation of the peace process can be possible only on the condition that Israel immediately stop its illegal settlement activities and take steps towards a two- State solution. In this context, I call on the international community to support our Palestinian brothers and sisters in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in their struggle for an independent and geographically unified Palestinian State. Despite the current absence of conflict there, the Balkans is another geographical location of potential crisis that still faces serious challenges. For this reason, we attach great importance to the integration of the Balkan countries into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Turkey will continue to do its part to ensure that peace, stability and well-being prevail in this exceptional part of the world. The territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and Georgia is the key to regional stability in the southern Caucasus. Therefore, we need to work harder towards the resolution of the conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We should never forget that each crisis we ignore today has the potential to spark a regional or even global crisis tomorrow. In this context, I would also like to underline that we are against nuclear weapons of all kinds, which have increasingly come to occupy the world agenda in recent days. It is clear that we cannot overcome these problems unless we completely free the world of the scourge of nuclear weapons. We are also saddened by the fact that the comprehensive negotiation process begun in 2008 has ended owing to the incomprehensible stance of the Greek Cypriots. We will do our best to ensure that the natural resources discovered in the eastern Mediterranean in recent years serve to further the peace, stability and welfare of the region. We are ready to consider proposals for a solution that respects the rights of Turkish Cypriots. Our world, already struggling with all of these global and regional problems, was shocked once again by the sad news that we received from Myanmar a few weeks ago. The Muslim community in the Rakhine region of Myanmar is being subjected to what almost amounts to ethnic cleansing, with provocative terrorist acts used as a pretext. The villages of the Rohingya Muslims, who have already been living in extreme poverty and misery, deprived of their citizenship rights, are being burned as hundreds of thousands of people are forced to migrate from the region and the country. The camps in Bangladesh to which the people migrating from the region are being diverted are not in a position to meet even their minimum humanitarian needs. As is the case in Syria, the international community has not given a good account of itself regarding the humanitarian plight of the Rohingya Muslims. If the tragedy in Myanmar is not stopped, the history of humankind will be marred by yet another dark stain. What is most important is to ensure that the Rohingya people who have taken refuge outside their country, especially in Bangladesh, are able to live in safety and peace and in conditions of well-being on their own lands, where they have lived for centuries. Turkey is endeavouring to help resolve this crisis as well. Recently, on the occasion of a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), we held a special session on that issue in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, with the participating countries. My wife, my son and our Ministers who visited the camps in Bangladesh immediately after the latest crisis personally witnessed the humanitarian plight of the people there. Clothing, food and other humanitarian aid was provided, and we are now looking at the second phase of such aid. We will be holding a meeting of the OIC Contact Group on Rohingya Muslims here at the United Nations this afternoon. As I mentioned, my wife, my son, our Ministers and some Turkish non-governmental organizations visited the area. The Turkish International Cooperation and Coordination Agency, the Turkish official aid organization, is also in the region; it is the only organization carrying out assistance activities. Furthermore, the Turkish Red Crescent and other non-governmental organizations are continuing to deliver humanitarian aid to the Rakhine Muslims in Myanmar. If the countries concerned provide the necessary means, we would like to continue our assistance activities in a more comprehensive way. I discussed these issues with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency AntÃ³nio Guterres, and we are now preparing to take further steps. All these developments and humanitarian tragedies confirm the relevance of our appeal for the restructuring of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, as symbolized by our motto, â??The world is bigger than fiveâ??. Gathered here under this roof, we must understand that it is high time to reform the Security Council. Under this roof, we represent the entire world, but if we cannot display the will to prevent murders carried out by terrorist organizations or prevent humanitarian crises, then everyone will find ways to help themselves. If that understanding prevails, then our world will be dragged into a new maelstorm of chaos and cruelty. If Western countries do not prevent tendencies such as xenophobia, racism and animosity against Islam, if the countries in the crisis-ridden regions of the world do not demonstrate decisive will to fight terrorist organizations and poverty, and if all of us do not cooperate with one another on all of those fronts, then how can we possibly reach our ideals of peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet? We support the work done to that end by the Secretary-General, with whom we cooperated closely during his tenure as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It is in nobodyâ??s interest to insist on the continuation of this distorted system, which no longer has the capacity to take concrete steps towards the good of humankind under its current form. We want the Security Council to have a democratic, transparent, fair and effective structure. We propose that the Security Council consist of 20 members with the same rights and competencies â?? each member serving for two years and half replaced every year. In that way, all countries would have a say in that important organ when it was their turn. It is imperative that we transform the United Nations, because the world is changing. We are living in a different world than the one where the United Nations was established after the Second World War. We must talk about a United Nations administered by representatives of the entire world as the embodiment of humankindâ??s common conscience. Before I conclude my remarks, let me remind the Assembly that, regardless of the colour of our faces and eyes, our tears are the same. I urge the Assembly take action immediately to stop the tears flowing in different parts of the world. I hope that the work of the seventy- second session of the General Assembly will contribute to our efforts to that end. With those thoughts, I salute with amity and respect all countries and peoples represented under this roof, at this joint parliament of humankind. On my own behalf, and on behalf of my country, I extend my greetings to the Assembly. God bless the Assembly.",1,196
7879,Session 72 - 2017,TUV_72_2017.txt,TUV_72_2017,72,2017,TUV,"Next week, on 1 October, Tuvalu will mark the thirty-ninth anniversary of its independence. It gives me great pleasure, therefore, on behalf of the Government and people of Tuvalu, to thank the United Nations and all its membership for granting Tuvalu the recognition of full sovereignty in October 1978. Twenty-two years later, on the eve of the twenty- first century in September 2000, Tuvalu was admitted as the 189th Member of the United Nations, with the rights of full participation as a member of the United Nations family. Our joining the United Nations is a journey of hope â?? hope in the noble values of this great body, the United Nations, and trust in its ability to assure humankind, including small and vulnerable countries like mine, peace, security and prosperity for our survival. I record Tuvaluâ??s sincere gratitude to the United Nations and its specialized agencies, development partners â?? especially our traditional partners in the Pacific, regional bodies of the Pacific â?? friends in Asia, India, South Korea, Japan, the Republic of China, the European Union and others, for all their support to my island nation of Tuvalu. We welcome the friendship and partnership of United Nations Members and other entities as we move forward. Tuvalu applauds the theme of the seventy-second general debate, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. It captures the undeniable linkage between peace, security and sustainable development. It underscores that, without peace and security, our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will not deliver a fair globalization for all. In short, without sustainable development, there will be no peace and no security. I congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency and on his vision of focusing on people during the seventy-second session. I also congratulate the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji, on his efforts and outstanding leadership on many fronts. I want to express the deepest sympathy of Tuvalu, as a small and vulnerable island nation, to the people of the United States of America and the Caribbean islands who are suffering or have been affected by the destruction caused by the recent hurricanes and tropical cyclones in that region. These unfortunate events clearly show the magnitude and urgency of global work still required of the United Nations to better prepare, protect and save peoples and humanity from such calamities. We also share the devastating grief of the people of Mexico, including young schoolchildren, following the earthquake this week, as well as other peoples suffering similar disasters and violence around the world. We pray that God brings comfort and a speedy recovery to the affected people and their loved ones. Horrific acts of violence and terrorism continue to plague our world. Countless innocent lives are destroyed and lost. Violence in any form is a direct threat to peace and security and seriously undermines our efforts to achieve sustainable development. We therefore condemn violence and terrorism in all their forms and manifestations. We are particularly concerned with the threat to global peace and security posed by the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. We acknowledge the persistent efforts of the Security Council to de-escalate tensions. A renewed engagement with inclusive diplomatic dialogue is, in our view, the only option for solving the crisis on the Korean peninsula. We believe that a military response would lead to unimaginable destruction and loss of life. In this vein, Tuvalu maintains its commitments in support of all international legal instruments against violence and terrorism. It is critical that we support international law for the protection and promotion of human rights. We commend the establishment of the Office of Counter-Terrorism to ensure the effective and balanced implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Just yesterday, and with pride on behalf of my country, Tuvalu, I signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as a further demonstration of our commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons and to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty, which was negotiated and drafted at the 1984 Pacific Island Leaders Forum, held in Tuvalu. It is our fervent hope that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including the trade in materials and the development of technologies to produce such weapons, are totally banned, outlawed and prohibited worldwide by the United Nations. Humankind must be advanced neither on the principles of fear and deterrence nor on the adage of â??might is rightâ??, but rather on moral justice for humankind, equity, trust, respect and the full enjoyment of basic human rights. The entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change last year raised our hopes that, in recognizing the existential threat to us all, Member States would commit to the common cause of fighting climate change, adapting to its impacts and strengthening the ability of developing States, especially the most vulnerable, to deal with them. The Paris Agreement is our common hope of a decent life on a sustainable planet. For Tuvalu, it is our hope of security and survival. This hope, however, dimmed with the announcement by the United States that it will abandon the Paris Agreement. This decision risks undermining our global efforts to save and protect the livelihoods of the people who are at risk from the impacts of climate change. These are the marginalized, the vulnerable, the poor, the women and the children who suffer the most from climate change, especially those who live on low-lying islands and incoastal areas. There are already tens of millions of these people, and their number is increasing at an alarming rate. Domestic, economic and political interests are often short-term and benefit only a few. They should not be pursued at the expense of a decent life for us all, current and future generations, on a sustainable planet. That is the spirit that underpins our twenty- first-century development system. We therefore urge the United States to reunite with us and to allow all of us, in particular the most vulnerable, the best possible chance to save ourselves and the sustainable future of humankind. We are nevertheless encouraged this morning by the strong leadership of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron on climate change. We thank them and highly commend their courage. We welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s intention to convene a dedicated climate summit in 2019 to mobilize political support. It will be an important opportunity, in our view, to review our progress and momentum and, most importantly, to enhance our commitment to taking urgent and credible actions to reverse global warming. We are also encouraged by the Secretary-Generalâ??s commitment to intensifying high-level political engagement to limit the temperature rise to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels and aiming at limiting the increase to 1.5Â°C. We are likewise heartened by his dedication to rallying the United Nations system to better support Member States by mobilizing resources and strengthening partnerships in their pursuit of climate action. Indeed, without enhanced commitment and genuine partnerships, the Paris Agreement will not save us all, especially the most vulnerable. Climate change is a risk multiplier on all factors of development. Its challenges are complex and continue to change. It is for this reason that we reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative on climate change and security in order to enhance international focus, coordination and commitment. In the same vein, we call for climate change and security to be a permanent item on the agenda of the Security Council, given its direct threat to global peace and security. For Tuvalu and many of the low-lying islands, our peace and security are not imperilled by traditional threats of conflict, violence, drugs, weapons, famine or disease. Instead, as the Maleâ?? Declaration on the Human Dimension of Climate Change recognized in 2007, â??the impacts of climate change pose the most immediate, fundamental and far-reaching threatâ?? to individuals and communities in these most vulnerable States and threaten a wide range of human rights, including â??the right to life, the right to take part in cultural life, the right to use and enjoy property, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to food and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental healthâ??. Ten years ago we recognized that climate change was the single greatest major threat to our peace, security and, ultimately, survival. It remains so today, and the situation grows more urgent every day. Under current warming trends, our islands may be submerged under the sea within the next 50 years. If and when that happens, we will be forced to abandon our islands, even though we contribute the least to global warming and sea-level rise. This forced relocation or displacement of our people is an injustice and an infringement on our fundamental and basic human rights. It is for this very reason that we continue to call for enhanced global commitment and partnerships in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We cannot give up on this campaign, for two very simple reasons. First, relocation and statelessness are totally unacceptable, as many of us here in the Hall would agree. Secondly, we all know that membership of our global family of the United Nations has the tools and resources to save Tuvalu and low-lying States from the impacts of climate change. It is only a question of whether we have the will and the courage to help these people. We have come together to face grave risks before. Over many years, the international community, guided by the Charter of the United Nations, has cooperated on many fronts to deal with threats such as Ebola, cholera, violence, natural disasters and, subsequently, the lives and rights of people displaced by such threats. The international response was immediate because these threats were potential global threats to humankind. For others, however, their response was driven by political and economic interests. Sadly, displacement owing to the impacts of climate change has not drawn the same international concern and response, despite the fact that it has the very real potential to become a serious threat to global peace, security and human rights. Uncontrolled mass migration into Europe as a result of conflicts and natural disasters, for example, has taught us the very important lesson that we should have had in place effective international institutions and systems to control, manage and protect the rights of migrants. In exactly the same manner, we must now formulate effective international systems to protect the human rights of people displaced by the impacts of climate change and avoid further uncontrolled mass migration and mass violation of human rights. This preparation must include developing the appropriate international legal tools to cope with the complex and multifaceted challenges posed by climate change. In particular, the current refugee regimes that were developed to cope with traditional threats do not adequately protect people forced to leave their homes by the impacts of climate change. We therefore reiterate our proposal for a United Nations resolution on the establishment of a legal process to protect the human rights and, ultimately, save the lives of people displaced by the impacts of climate change. As a least developed country (LDC) and a small island developing State (SIDS), we need enhanced global support to overcome the structural challenges we face in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On our own part, Tuvalu has developed its national strategy for sustainable development, known as Te Kakeega III, premised on building resilience through good governance, inclusive participation and capacity measures for mitigation for LDCs, with targets of 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020, as well as coastal protection adaptation on all islands, in order to protect and save Tuvalu. We are grateful to the members of the international community for their generous support through the work of the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility and the United Nations Development Programme, as well as through other donors and bilateral partners. While grateful for their goodwill, we have established our own Tuvalu Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund as a facility to help people respond quickly to the impacts of climate change. To enhance further adaptation work, access to appropriate infrastructures, maritime ports on the islands, airports, technology connectivity, health care, quality education and renewable energy are critical areas of particular priority. Tuvalu will welcome the development of genuine and durable partnerships, as aspired to under the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. In regard to the issue of LDC graduation, it is our view that a country must graduate only when it can achieve sustainable development, not merely when it should be able to achieve it. The unique vulnerability of SIDS and LDCs such as Tuvalu must be the central criteria of consideration for LDC graduation. As small islands surrounded by vast oceans, we interact with the ocean every day of our lives. We are heavily dependent on the ocean, and the ocean is central to our achievement of sustainable development. We firmly believe that once we have established our baselines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, these baselines, as well as the identified maritime zones, shall remain forever. This is irrespective of sea-level rise. The ongoing discussions on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction must ensure that small island developing States, with our particular vulnerabilities, are provided the necessary financial and technical support to guarantee our equal and fair participation in the management and sharing of benefits from this instrument. We must agree at this session of the Assembly to commence work on developing a legally binding agreement to give protection to biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions. Our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal and holistic in that it applies to all countries and actors and covers all aspects of sustainable development. Critically to its success, the agenda is rooted in human rights and genuine partnerships. But the vibrant democracy of Taiwan, which has long been an active and responsible development partner to many countries, including Tuvalu, is being denied participation in the United Nations system. It cannot be right that the twenty-second-largest global economy, with a notable capacity to contribute, cannot effectively participate in our 2030 Agenda. This is unfortunate, given that our 2030 Agenda needs genuine global partnerships to mobilize all available resources to be successful. Under its principle of universality, the United Nations should allow the 23 million people of Taiwan to enjoy their fundamental right to participate fully in the United Nations system and to benefit and contribute effectively to its programmes. In the same vein, the people of Cuba must be allowed to freely exercise their rights to determine their own political, economic and social systems. With their rights and trade restricted by the unilateral blockade imposed by the United States, the people of Cuba are denied effective participation in our Sustainable Development Goals programmes. Of similar concerns, the people of West Papua should be enabled to exercise their fundamental right, with the intervention of this responsible Organization, to determine their own development aspirations and future. The West Papuans are a distinct people with Pacific roots, with their own land, history and culture. The violation of human rights in West Papua is a matter of constant and great concern to us. Tuvalu strongly believes that the United Nations must engage in setting a clear pathway to address these issues and the issue of self-determination for the people of West Papua. We must embrace the genuine partnership of those who can contribute to the realization of a decent life in our marginalized communities. We cannot ignore and risk leaving behind those who hope for a decent life but are being constrained by violence, natural disasters, violation of human rights, atrocities and the impacts of climate change. We cannot leave anyone behind. Finally, I wish to express Tuvaluâ??s strong support for a global pact on the environment, as initiated and proposed by France. We need an internationally legally binding agreement that protects our rights to a safe and clean environment. We are but on one big canoe for humankind and, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this morning, no one country has the right to jump ship on climate change. We must either paddle together to keep the canoe afloat and safe, or allow the canoe to sink and drown. It is our hope that, with this global pact on the environment and the Paris Agreement, we can save Tuvalu. If we can save Tuvalu, we can save the world.",1,196
7880,Session 72 - 2017,TZA_72_2017.txt,TZA_72_2017,72,2017,TZA,"I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over deliberations of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. My delegation pledges full support to you and your Bureau. Allow me to convey warm fraternal greetings from His Excellency Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who wished to be here but, due to other pressing commitments at home, is unable to attend this session of the Assembly. President Magufuli has sent me to assure the Assembly that his Government will continue to support the United Nations and its noble mandate to promote global peace, security, freedom and development. We also wish to extend Tanzaniaâ??s unwavering support and cooperation to the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, as he continues to discharge his duties. My delegation pays tribute to your predecessor, Mr. President â?? His Excellency Ambassador Peter Thomson â?? for his exemplary leadership during the Assemblyâ??s seventy-first session. His tireless efforts in promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as his dedication to resolving the plight of refugees and migrants and reviving consultations on the reforms of the United Nations, particularly of the Security Council, will remain part of his legacy. We are confident that you and your team will advance from where he left off, as you pledged in your opening statement. Today, the world is facing myriad challenges, which include new and old threats such as international terrorism and other international crimes, persistent poverty, hunger and climate change, as well as global inequalities in economic and social status among nations. Those challenges call for a common and urgent response by the entire United Nations system and the international community as a whole. It is in that regard that my delegation welcomes the theme for this session â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. The theme is timely and welcomed, as most of our countries are adjusting their development strategies and plans to ensure the speedy and timely implementation of the Goals and targets enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet should focus on ending poverty, promoting economic and social prosperity, addressing inequality and injustices, and tackling the adverse impacts of climate change. That can be achieved by successfully implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cognizant of that fact, Tanzania has integrated the Sustainable Development Goals into the second phase of our five-year development plan for 2016 to 2021, which focuses on industrialization, on the basis of complementarity between the agricultural and industrial sectors. That plan is one of our tools for the realization of our National Development Vision 2025, which seeks to bring our country to middle-income status. In collaboration with our development partners and other stakeholders, we have developed frameworks for implementing the SDGs, which include communication and dissemination strategies on the SDGs to make the Goals understandable to everyone. Dissemination is in both English and Kiswahili, which is our national language, spoken by all Tanzanians. Sensitization workshops on SDGs are also being conducted for regional administrations and local Government authorities, so that the Goals can be mainstreamed in their local plans and budgets in order to directly involve and benefit ordinary people, who are the main focus of the 2030 Agenda. Tanzania has set a target growth from an average of 7 per cent in 2015 to 10 per cent by 2020, in order to reach middle-income status by 2025. We also believe that such growth will encourage efforts to promote equality in society by reducing the unemployment rate from the current 10.3 per cent to 8 per cent and will also reduce the proportion of population below the poverty line. That growth can be achieved by, among other things, increasing employment in both rural and urban areas and providing financial support through soft loans to youth and women. Other measures include strengthening small and medium enterprises, securing fair taxation and fiscal regimes for business entities and restoring discipline and accountability. Fighting corruption, financial discipline and accountability in all sectors are the hallmarks of President Magufuliâ??s Government. Climate change has become an existential challenge to the entire planet Earth. All parts of the world are increasingly experiencing the adverse impact of climate change, manifested in persistent droughts, land degradation, coastal erosion, ocean temperature rise and extreme weather patterns such as cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and floods. In Tanzania, for instance, it is disheartening to witness the epic snows and glaciers of Kilimanjaro â?? the highest mountain in Africa â?? melting at an alarming rate. Against that background, I would like to express my Governmentâ??s heartfelt sympathies and condolences to our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean, South Asia, Mexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the United States of America and all around the world who have recently been victims of the disastrous impact of climate change. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost their lives and those who have been dispossessed and displaced. For all of us, this should be a wake-up call and a reminder that climate change has no boundaries and can potentially wipe out economic and development achievements in the blink of an eye. Therefore, the sooner we act, the better chances we have to protect the planet Earth for the present and future generations. It is fortunate that we have the Paris Agreement, which already entered into force in November 2016, to address this problem. To honour our joint efforts that gave birth to the Paris Agreement under the leadership of France, we should implement, in letter and spirit, all of its articles. Assistance to developing countries should go beyond mere mitigation measures and should target adaptation measures with built-in green technologies to control carbon emissions from the outset. Violent conflicts continue to plague the world and to challenge the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. They claim thousands of lives and lead to massive displacements and flights of people in search of safer places. We need to invest more in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and mediation efforts by addressing the root causes, the precipitating and triggering factors of conflicts. Peacekeeping, peacebuilding and State-building are essential to the maintenance and consolidation of peace where peace has been secured. We commend the role of the United Nations in spearheading those peace initiatives. Striving for peace should be a collective endeavour involving Governments, international organizations, regional blocs, non-State actors, religious groups, civil societies and individuals. Sustainable peace and security is prerequisite for the achievement of sustainable development. In that regard, we commend our men and women in Blue Helmets who are sacrificing their lives to serve the heroic cause of peacekeeping. Tanzania, with other countries, has been contributing troops to several United Nations peacekeeping missions. We have paid a high price through the loss of peacekeepers serving in different missions. It is only this week that Tanzania lost a soldier in the Democratic Republic of the Congo following an attack by the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces. We condemn that cowardly act in the strongest possible terms. Nonetheless, Tanzania remains steadfast and committed to contributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions. At the same time, we urge the Security Council to continue strengthening the operational capability of the Force Intervention Brigade in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo so that it can effectively deal with negative forces and asymmetrical warfare, which are manifesting in different war theatres in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tanzania has maintained its record as a peaceful country upholding the rule of law, democracy and other principles of good governance. It has been a country of refuge for many decades. At the same time, Tanzania has been actively participating in regional and international peace initiatives, including the ongoing Burundi peace process, which has been supervised by the East African Community, facilitated by the former President of Tanzania, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, and mediated by His Excellency President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. The peace talks are still on track, although their pace is slow and halting. It is encouraging to note that in some parts of Burundi, the security situation has significantly improved to permit the voluntary return of some 12,000 refugees of the almost 250,000 refugees who have been in Tanzania since 2015. We appreciate the partnership we have had with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in protecting and assisting the refugees in our country. Tanzania has also for decades been receiving and hosting refugees from pockets of troubled areas in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We trust that there will be full implementation of the 31 December 2016 peace agreement, with the promise of timely elections in that country. We urge the leadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to live up to that commitment and to issue an election calendar soon. In that connection, we urge the international community to extend both logistical and financial support to the Democratic Republic of the Congo so that it can complete the registration of voters and expeditiously carry out the planned elections. On the agenda of the General Assembly and the Security Council, there are two protracted problems that require decisive action. One is the issue of the self- determination of the Sahrawi people. With the return of Morocco into the African Union fold, expectations are high in Africa that negotiations on that issue, which is on the agenda of the Security Council, will receive renewed momentum and urgency. On Palestine, we support the two-State solution â?? two States living side by side in peaceful coexistence. To that end, the elements of a viable State of Palestine must be ensured and respected. The long-stalled peace process in the Middle East must be rekindled with a series of acceptable confidence-building measures by both sides with the support and guarantee of the United Nations and the international community in its entirety. In the Assembly, we have been calling for the cessation of economic, commercial, fmancial and other embargoes imposed on Cuba, without significant results. The intention of the United States to reverse the agreements between the two countries on normalizing relations is a setback to the progress that had been registered and applauded by all of us in the Assembly and beyond. Tanzania continues to call for the total removal of all embargoes on Cuba. The people-to- people contact that has started between the peoples of both Cuba and the United States should serve as building blocks for enduring peaceful good-neighbourliness in the spirit of dialogue and understanding. After the end of the Cold War, there was a new dawn and bright prospects for both conventional and nuclear disarmament. The doctrine of nuclear deterrence was becoming obsolete, negotiations for the reduction of nuclear arsenals were making progress towards a nuclear ban treaty, including nuclear testing, and some aspirants to nuclear weapons abandoned their ambitions. However, the recent developments in the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea have shattered these optimistic prospects. The world is being dragged back to nuclear brinkmanship. This is the most recent threat to international peace and security. Tanzania supports all relevant resolutions of the Security Council on the nuclear-weapons trends in the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea and calls for de-escalation of the political warfare and propaganda, and for the renewal of dialogue under the auspices of the Six-Party Talks. On the other hand, Tanzania commends the recent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which puts nuclear weapons on the same legal ground as other weapons of mass destruction. We should all support the Treaty in order to increase our moral authority in the fight against nuclear- weapons proliferation. The reforms of the United Nations to make the Organization more efficient and relevant in order to cope with new trends and challenges must be continuous and progressive. The latest initiative of the Secretary- General is a commendable effort that should have received consensual support from the entire United Nations membership. We hope that, in the process of implementing these latest reform proposals, the debates will be all-inclusive and progress will be made on the basis of consensus among the entire membership of the United Nations. The delay in Security Council reform is indeed testing the political will of the key players on this serious matter, and the debate has now become routine and sterile. The status quo is undercutting the primary responsibility of the Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Democratizing the Security Council is good for the Council and for the world in the twenty-first century. In conclusion, I wish to return to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by making a clarion call to the United Nations and its Member States to implement the goals contained therein, in measured and agreed benchmarks and intervals. The economic and social benefits of well-implemented goals will enhance democracy, freedom and security at the national, regional and international levels, leaving no one behind.",1,196
7881,Session 72 - 2017,UGA_72_2017.txt,UGA_72_2017,72,2017,UGA,"I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and assure him of Ugandaâ??s support. We are confident that he will lead the Assembly effectively and successfully. I would also like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. I also pay tribute to His Excellency Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres for his personal dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations. The theme for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, is very pertinent. I am happy this topic is being discussed. I have always wondered why the elites in the different countries of the world do not see its importance. Who would lose if everyone in the world led a decent life and every adult consumed between 2,000 and 2,500 calories per day? Who would lose if everyone were consuming the right number of calories every day? Who would lose if everyone were immunized against immunizable diseases? Who would lose if all the immunizable diseases that afflict people were immunized against? Who would lose if we were to achieve universal immunization for all the people in the world? What would be the problem? Who would lose if all young people, children, accessed education to achieve literacy, numeracy and skills, as a minimum? Who would lose if all human beings had health units within a radius of 5 kilometres from where they live? Who would lose if all human beings had access to clean electricity, away from charcoal, firewood and dirty kerosene? Who would lose if every adult had a well- paying job? Who would lose if every family on the globe had a decent, three-bedroom house? Who would lose if every person had access to clean water? Who would lose if no person on the globe had to worry about war, terrorism or crime? Who would lose if every provider of a service or producer of a good that is needed for use in the world had a right of access to markets? Who would lose if all the countries in the world had good transport and other elements of infrastructure? Who would lose if we all insisted on protecting Mother Nature so that it can also look after us? To what extent would this effort at global affluence stimulate business? How much cement, steel, copper and food would we need? How would all that impact business? If we aimed at global affluence, how much would this impact business positively? Why, then, do we all have bad businessmen who do not have spectacles effective enough to see the implied business opportunities if we aim at global affluence? As a milk and beef producer myself, only a few months ago I was cautioning my fellow farmers against excessive greed as far as the price per litre of milk and per kilogram of beef were concerned. The farmers were trying to demand extremely high prices for beef and milk, but I warned them that if the milk were too expensive, the people might not buy it as much as if it were better priced. The more buyers we have for our products, the more prosperous we will be. We would therefore be both good businesspeople as well as good Christians, because we would be doing business in a fair way. Therefore, in my opinion, parasitism is the only obstacle to global affluence, prosperity and peace. On the dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula, where very dangerous instruments of mass extermination are paraded around by the two contending sides, I have one question. My approach today is just to pose questions. I will not answer all of them, but I put them to the Assembly so that members can answer them themselves. I have one question. Who would lose if North Korea and South Korea, those kith and kin, were left alone to discuss their reunification? The Korean nation came into existence in 1234 A.D., according to the information available on the Internet. Why cannot these people â?? they are one people â?? discuss their reunification instead of maintaining a divided peninsula, the division of which it is our job to manage endlessly? Koreans were temporarily divided towards the end of the Second World War. Why should this division be allowed to be permanent and a source of dangerous tensions? A unified Korea would be a very strong nation. Why do some actors fear strong nations in the world? Why should the Koreans themselves, North and South, allow external forces to continue to divide them? We always strive not to allow actors, foreign or local, to divide the African peoples, regardless of the complications involved. When one hears that Uganda accommodates many African refugees, it is on account of a conscious ideological position to not allow any actors to divide us. We fight only traitors. Who has been hurt by a unified Viet Nam since 1975, although the method of their unification was not the best one? Who has been hurt by the reunification of Germany since 1990? Finally, on the small issue of enforcing sanctions against North Korea, Uganda is in compliance. That is not a big problem, for we do not have to trade with North Korea. We are, however, grateful that, in the past, the North Koreans helped us to build our tank forces.",1,196
7882,Session 72 - 2017,UKR_72_2017.txt,UKR_72_2017,72,2017,UKR,"On behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. Ukraine fully supports all six priorities for the upcoming session defined by him and is ready to assist him in his noble efforts. A lot must be done to translate our common vision of a peaceful, prosperous and equal world into reality. The spiral of violence continues to affect more and more countries and regions. Transnational terrorism, the use of force in international relations, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the refugee crisis, poverty, human rights violations and environmental fragility are only some of the challenges we face. The scope of the threats demands our joint and resolute response. It is time to act, and we have a very narrow window of opportunity to avoid an irreversible decline. The United Nations should be at the forefront of this process. Ukraine has always advocated for the need to reform the Organization to meet the most urgent global challenges in a timely and adequate manner. In that regard, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary- General, since the first day of his mandate, to develop and implement a robust and comprehensive United Nations reform agenda. We support no less the United States initiative to promote an effective and meaningful reform of the United Nations. Comprehensive reform of the Security Council is long overdue, and we hope that this session will herald new momentum in the intergovernmental negotiations on the blueprint for the Security Council reform. Let me take this opportunity to state clearly that we in Ukraine could not agree more with the call for the sovereignty of nations to be universally respected and guaranteed. That very conclusion was timely and rightly raised yesterday from this rostrum. When the United Nations was set up, it was designed to maintain peace and security in the world, based on the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States and the integrity of their borders. The founding nations, including Ukraine, aimed to secure a world where the sovereign rights of free choice would be respected. The five permanent members of the Security Council (P-5) were to safeguard that principle in the name of sustainable peace and security. That was the principle that one of the P-5 member States so blatantly violated against my own country. This principle needs to be put back on track using whatever means and tools we have at hand. Ukraine is the right place to invest in that noble endeavour, in the name of sustainable peace and security. That is what millions of Ukrainians have struggled for since the beginning of the Russian aggression in 2014 in both Donbas and Crimea. A three-year-long war with Russia has resulted in 10,000 people killed and 7 per cent of Ukrainian territory occupied, and 20 per cent of the Ukrainian economy and industrial output has been seized, destroyed or simply stolen. However, the most horrific thing in this situation is that the Kremlin has consciously chosen the tactics of increasing human suffering. According to human rights activists, the occupied Crimean peninsula has turned into a territory of repression. Anyone disagreeing with the Kremlin risks their freedom, and even their life. Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars get arrested even for posting in social networks or â?? as was case of the Crimean farmer Volodymyr Balukh, in December 2016 â?? just for putting a Ukrainian national flag on his private residence. Persecution of the leaders of the Mejlis â?? the representative organ of Crimean Tatars, whose activities the Russian occupiers banned â?? continues. Only a week ago, Ahtem Chiygoz, Deputy Head of the Mejlis, was sentenced to eight years in prison for standing up 4/29 17-29395 against the Russian occupation. Another Deputy Head of the Mejlis, Ilmi Umerov, who has a serious health problem, remains under house arrest, not even allowed to leave Crimea for medical treatment. Russia blatantly violates resolution 71/205, entitled â??Situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (Ukraine)â??. It keeps ignoring all requests of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure proper and full access of the international human rights monitoring mission to Crimea. The Kremlin pays no respect to the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice imposed on it. The Court urged Russia to refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve its representative institutions, including the Mejlis, and to ensure the right for Ukrainian citizens to study in the Ukrainian language. The international community must give a proper response to such Russian disregard of its international obligations. It must keep a close eye on Crimea to prevent a new genocide inspired by the modern proponents of Stalinâ??s totalitarian ideology against the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. I rely on the support of delegations here for Ukraineâ??s initiatives to ensure the observance of human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea, in particular in a further General Assembly resolution. We need to strengthen the international regime of de-occupation of Crimea. The fact that at the highest international level â?? the General Assembly â?? Russia was recognized as an occupying Power proves that we are on the absolutely right track. The time has come to establish a new international group of friends of Ukrainian Crimea to coordinate and promote our common steps. We count on the coordinated and targeted support of our international partners. The militarization of Crimea is another security threat that affects the whole of Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as North Africa and the Middle East. Ukraine strongly condemns the numerous military exercises conducted in occupied Crimea, as well as those close to the borders of Ukraine, in particular that known as West-2017. Together with our neighbours and partners, we urge Russia to ensure full compliance with its commitments under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Vienna Document and other international rules concerning military activity. The security and human rights situations in Donbas remain no less dramatic than in Crimea. This year, Ukraine initiated three major ceasefire attempts â?? the Easter, Harvest and Back-to-School ceasefires. Yet again, Russian occupation troops and their proxies violated them almost immediately. In breach of the Minsk agreements, Russia keeps its regular military in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and continues to supply heavy weapons and ammunition to the occupation troops. It flatly denies the establishment of the OSCE permanent control over the Ukraine-Russia border, and the release of hostages within the Minsk process is completely deadlocked. The list of Ukrainian hostages in Donbas grows constantly. People are captured deliberately. Their only fault is that they have a pro-Ukrainian position. We remember the fate of 16-year-old Stepan Chubenko, who was killed with five shots in the head after Russians saw him wearing a Ukrainian ribbon. Another example is the 63-year-old Donetsk theologian Ihor Kozlovsky, who has been in jail for over two years under false accusations and deprived of any communication with his family and friends. Russia still keeps at least 16 Ukrainian political prisoners on its territory. Ukrainian film director Oleh Sentsov and Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko are among the most prominent cases. Just think about it. Stealing other nationsâ?? land, kidnapping people, conducting a hidden war, downing a civilian aircraft, spreading lies globally â?? is this the kind of behaviour we expect from a permanent member of the Security Council? Russia is not a contributor to international security, but its biggest threat. Russia is perhaps the only country in the world that has conflicts â?? hot, frozen or potential â?? with almost all its neighbours. The key problem in Donbas is that Ukraine and Russia strive for completely different things. Ukraine wants peace and restoration of sovereignty over its territory. Russia wants control over Ukraine and undermines every effort to restore our sovereign control within Ukraineâ??s borders. To that end, Russia tries to exchange peace in Ukraine for Ukraineâ??s freedom. I want to utter a very strong message â?? Ukraine will never accept that kind of a deal, nor will the international community.The latest hybrid peacekeeping proposals from Moscow are yet another example of Russiaâ??s real ambitions: to legalize its proxies and to freeze the conflict forever. 17-29395 5/29 We would welcome any proposal that would bring peace to my country. We remain convinced that a full- fledged United Nations peacekeeping operation is the only viable solution to de-escalate, to protect people of Ukraine and to get us closer to a political solution. That is why the peacekeepersâ?? mandate should cover the entire occupied area, including the Ukrainian- Russian State border. That is the must. As long as the border is used as the main supply route for manpower and weapons to Donbas, there will be no peace in my country. The mission should respect basic United Nations peacekeeping principles and guidelines. One of them is that United Nations peacekeepers should be impartial. There is no place for the aggressorâ??s personnel. They cannot be a part of it by definition. Let me stress that any abuse of the United Nations peacekeeping toolbox to secure the gains of aggression is absolutely unacceptable. If we have an opportunity to bring peace to the heart of Europe, we should get the conditions right. A robust international presence can also help us cope with the increase in terrorist activities in the conflict-affected areas. The terrorist component in Russiaâ??s hybrid war against Ukraine is clearly visible and has become a reality of everyday life in Donbas. Three years ago, the world was stunned when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, with 298 people on board, was blown up in the skies over Donbas. Ukraine is determined to do everything to bring to justice those responsible for that mass murder. Two investigations, technical and criminal, have been carried out. Both revealed the details. Those who were behind that horrible crime came from Russia. The missile came from Russia. The death of the MH-17 victims is on Russiaâ??s conscience. The five countries that comprise the Joint Investigation Team have decided to prosecute those responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 within the Dutch judicial system. This year, the International Court of Justice started hearing the case brought by Ukraine against Russia for the violation of the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and we hope that the decision of the United Nations highest court will help bring the Russian Federation to justice for its numerous violations of international law and for financing crimes committed since 2014. As the process begins, we count on the support and facilitation of all States Members of the United Nations. For decades, Ukraine has served as a resolute contributor to global security. In the name of peace and in exchange for security assurances, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal â?? the third-largest in the world. Twenty years after being invaded by one of those who were bound to respect and, if necessary, to protect Ukraineâ??s border, we neverthless remain a resolute advocate of global non-proliferation and disarmament. That is why we strongly condemn the nuclear tests and multiple launches of ballistic missiles by North Korea. We are deeply concerned about the continuous diversion of resources from critical human needs to fuel Pyongyangâ??s nuclear arsenal, coupled with serious human rights abuses. We resolutely stand for reinforced measures to stop Pyongyangâ??s illegal activities and to bring North Korea into line with the international legal framework. At the same time, let me reiterate Ukraineâ??s call on the Security Council to undertake an in-depth investigation into developments in the North Korean nuclear and missiles programme in order to expose any possible foreign assistant to Pyongyang in that area. We also express our deepest concern over the current situation in Syria. We believe that the full implementation of and adherence to the word and spirit of the 2012 Geneva communiquÃ© (A/66/865, annex) and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) are absolutely vital for the settlement of the conflict in that country. What draws our special concern with regard to that bloody conflict is Russiaâ??s use of occupied Crimea as a military outpost for projecting power in Syria. As the war there rages on, a huge number of Russian military assets are deployed to Syria by ships based in the Crimean harbour. It is also deeply disturbing that the African continent continues to suffer from numerous unresolved conflicts. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, my country has spared no effort to support the African continent in safeguarding the main principles of the international order: sovereignty, non-interference in domestic affairs, the rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes. As the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the Central African Republic, we have actively supported regional and international efforts to stabilize the situation in the Central African Republic. In January 2017, Ukraine assumed the chairmanship of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan, and we are determined to contribute to the international efforts to resolve the conflict in Darfur. African countries can fully count on Ukraine as their reliable friend. My country is fully committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite heavy defence expenses â?? more than 5 per cent of our gross domestic product â?? Ukraine continues to go through a fundamental transformation, fighting corruption, promoting judicial reform, implementing decentralization and improving business opportunities. A year and a half ago, the economic situation in Ukraine was so dire that we could only dream about macroeconomic stabilization. Now we have grounds to say that economic recovery is in place. Among our priorities within the 2030 Development Agenda in Ukraine are such areas as ensuring a sustainable energy supply, food security, promoting innovation, development and sustainable infrastructure, as well as promoting an effective public health system, affordable education and decent work. I am convinced that no country alone can achieve sustainable development without sustainable peace and sustainable security. There is also no doubt that the mitigation of global warming remains an indispensable element of sustainable development. I am proud that Ukraine is fully committed to our obligations under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Our intentions in that regard are very serious. Ukraine was the first European country to deposit its instrument of ratification with the United Nations. The United Nations has always played a leading role in ensuring that the crimes of the past can never happen again. The seventy-second session of the General Assembly coincides with the eighty-fifth anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the twentieth century â?? the Holodomor. It was a man- made famine in Ukraine in 1932 and 1933, organized by the totalitarian regime of Stalin, which killed from 7 million to 10 million Ukrainians. Mr. Raphael Lemkin, the author of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, described the destruction of the Ukrainian nation as a classic example of genocide. I appeal to all United Nations States Members to make their own historic judgment and to make a decision to recognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide. This is a challenging time for all of us. Ever more people die in wars and natural disasters. Truth is blindsided by post-truth. The world is divided again between those who believe that freedom is indispensable and those who believe that freedom is expendable. One group wants to reach a better future, the other drags us to the past. It is time for those who believe in freedom to come together. It is time for freedom to be strong, convincing and convinced. Let it be that way.",1,196
7883,Session 72 - 2017,URY_72_2017.txt,URY_72_2017,72,2017,URY,"As we greet all delegations, we also welcome the holding of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly. Uruguay is convinced that today more than ever we need to strengthen these bodies of international coordination and leadership. Failure to do so would be to abandon humankind to transnational powers that escape regulation and arbitrarily impose their rule, notwithstanding the full validity of national sovereignties, which, throughout the course of history, have shown great longevity and bravely responded to challenges. By instituting the reforms necessary to adapt its structures and methodologies to a time that is very different from the one in which it was born, the United Nations should become stronger, and the General Assembly, its main body, should be given higher priority. This would be a worthwhile endeavour, given that the Assembly is and will continue to be the expression of a universal demos, which humankind must safeguard as the ideal for organizing peaceful coexistence on a global scale, where all States, large and small, are equally worthy and respected. Uruguayâ??s foreign policy has focused on certain traditional pillars that have governed its actions throughout history, such as democracy, the rule of law, respect for and promotion of human rights, the defence of multilateralism, and the commitment to dialogue and peace. These are the principles that our country has historically defended and actively promoted. Uruguay has made these pillars its State policy, supported by all its political parties regardless of the different ideological or programmatic orientations that alternate based on the rotation of power that is inherent to our idea of democracy. They represent a common heritage and a key chapter of the agreements entered into throughout our history that define our national identity. Today, with the world facing a broad range of threats and challenges, Uruguay is resolved to make its voice heard and base its actions on the international stage on those cornerstones that have held up its architecture in a peaceful and democratic manner. The increase in armed conflicts, characterized by unprecedented violence, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the expansion in the trade of all types of weapons, the spread of terrorism, cyberattacks, hunger and the devastating effects of climate change make it more than ever necessary for the international community to make a strong commitment to addressing them. At a time when many of these expressions of violence and devastation are the result of global causes, it would be injudicious to strive to impose painful or insufficiently local responses to such challenges. The international community must rise to the occasion, consolidate its frameworks for joint action andstrengthen global governance in order to resolve these serious problems. Today, millions of people are directly affected by violence and armed conflict. Hundreds of thousands have been killed and thousands of others injured, and millions of displaced persons have been forced to flee their homes and risk their lives in search of peace. We should never consent to idly stand by when faced with such tragedy and devastation, in the midst of an indifference out of which we are shaken only exceptionally, when a memorable image moves or strikes us. Such an image â?? and this is the greatest tragedy â?? may be sadly representative of the fate of tens or hundreds of thousands of human beings whose lives and sad destinies we will never know. â??Wasted livesâ?? was how Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman, the father of â??liquid modernityâ??, described them in his outstanding essay. It is only right to recall here that the world bade Bauman farewell earlier this year. Unfortunately, human trafficking networks, which take advantage of human despair and vulnerability, emerge in those contexts, promising people a non-existent future. In the face of this scourge, all countries gathered here must redouble their efforts to combat all forms of trafficking, including human trafficking. All States must cooperate in order to put an end to all such heinous practices, which denigrate their victims and strip them of their basic humanity in service of the interests of global criminal and terrorist networks, and in order to promote the growth and social development of nations. Let us call a spade a spade: inequality remains the main cause of most of the difficulties and threats that we face. We all know that, with the current advances in science and technology, poverty and hunger are unacceptable, and issues stemming from poor organization and the inequitable distribution of power and national and international resources are the cause of their unjustifiable persistence. For that reason, we reiterate that the rule of law and development are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Both are therefore essential to sustainable development at the national and international levels. Uruguay fully endorse the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the commitment to leave no one behind. It pledges its unqualified support for that commitment, without any preconditions. It is a commitment that can be undertaken in a straightforward manner by a country such as ours, which throughout its history has made the fight against abandonment one of the marks of its identity and succeeded in building, from a relatively early stage, a reasonably integrated society with a significant degree of social cohesion, although not without having to confront challenges and difficulties. In July, at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, my country, for the second year in a row, submitted its voluntary national report on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which involved carrying out a regular process of consultations and interinstitutional coordination with the participation of the Government, academia, civil society, the private sector and international organizations, with respect to its implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there is an issue on the United Nations agenda that is even more vital for Uruguay â?? disarmament as a prelude to peace. The international community must be committed to actively seeking effective solutions to this global problem. The growing threat of terrorism and the challenge it poses to the international community as a whole, the risk of the potential use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist groups, and the acquisition and use of conventional weapons and the links of such weapons with transnational crime have made the failure to disarm one of the greatest threats facing humankind . It is therefore a matter of deep concern. Controlling the international arms trade is an urgent necessity, given that trafficking and arms deals with warring parties in conflicts contribute directly to the suffering and murder of civilians. For that reason, the accession to and ratification of international instruments intended to protect civilians, such as the historic Arms Trade Treaty, are a great contribution to that end. And let me repeat here in the General Assembly something that has already been mentioned in the Security Council. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 74 per cent of the total volume of arms exports in the period 2011-2015 was carried out specifically by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Similarly, military spending in 2016 was $1.69 trillion, which was higher than in 2015. We should ask ourselves how many needs could have been met had those funds been redirected to the economic and social development of countries. The possession of nuclear weapons and the delay in disarmament by the States that possess them also endanger and threaten the worldâ??s stability and human security. If the proliferation of nuclear weapons overtakes diplomacy, the consequences will be devastating. Diplomacy, diplomacy and more diplomacy: that is the path that we must take. The use and threat of use of nuclear weapons constitute a crime against humankind and a serious violation of international law, including international humanitarian law, as well as of the Charter of the United Nations. The only guarantee against the use and threat of use of those weapons is their explicit prohibition and total elimination. Nevertheless, far from abandoning their weapons programmes, the nuclear Powers continue to improve and actively modernize their nuclear arsenals. Data from specialized organizations indicate that nine countries have more than 17,000 nuclear weapons, of which approximately 2,000 are on high alert, ready to be launched at a momentâ??s notice. Uruguay welcomes the success of the United Nations conference that negotiated a binding instrument to ban nuclear weapons and bring about their total elimination. It concluded with the adoption of the historic Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, recently opened to all States for signature, and to which Uruguay has just acceded. In that regard, we call on all countries to sign the instrument, which aims to ensure a dignified life for future generations and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. As part of its concern about the development of nuclear weapons, Uruguay expresses its strong condemnation of North Koreaâ??s nuclear tests and ballistic-missile launches and urges that country to abandon its existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way, putting an immediate end to all related activities, including launches using ballistic-missile technology, and other acts of provocation. In the same vein, we urge that country to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which it abandoned in 2003, and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime. However, we also urge all countries, in particular the great United States, to avoid the verbal escalations that have always preceded major tragedies throughout history and weigh every word in a responsible manner, eschewing all violent rhetoric. A dynamic of antagonism often makes it impossible to stick to the facts. In addressing the 3rd meeting of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, our Secretary- General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, made reference to â??sleepwalking our way to warâ??, inspired by the eloquent title recently used by the historian Christopher Clark to describe how human beings and nations marched into the tragedy of the First World War, dazed and confused by mutual misunderstandings and unheeded warnings. When they became aware of the outcome, it was too late. Just three months before ending its term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Uruguay wishes to emphasize once again that it is firmly convinced of the importance of focusing its efforts on protecting civilian populations in all conflict zones by using different modalities, through peacekeeping operations and the delivery of humanitarian assistance, by, inter alia, protecting hospitals and medical personnel and denouncing flagrant violations of human rights. In the current context of crisis, we wish to acknowledge the bravery and altruism of humanitarian personnel as they continue to assist, at the risk of their own lives, those in need in conflict situations. We understand that the best way to honour humanitarian workers, who have saved thousands of lives in numerous settings, is to devise successful policies and reach agreement within the framework of the United Nations to bring about the immediate cessation of attacks on civilians, while making possible the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in conflict situations. We are concerned at the increasing number of attacks on and deliberate bombings of civilians, humanitarian workers and civil infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and markets, all of which are serious human rights violations. The ultimate atrocity is when defenceless human beings are attacked while they are assisting other defenceless human beings at the worst times and in the worst places. Not only should we emphatically condemn this, but we should also adopt resolutions to protect victims and bring perpetrators to justice. Uruguay once again calls for full compliance with Security Council resolutions, especially resolution 2286 (2016), and the establishment of effective mechanisms for itsimplementation. I wish to reiterate that this kind of attack against civilian targets, disguised as collateral attacks, should never be tolerated. It is undeniable that we are experiencing deep- seated changes in the kinds of conflicts we are seeing. The increasing presence of terrorist organizations and non-State actors spreads fear among populations and disproportionately undermines the rights of women and children. History has shown us that there is a constant pattern in terms of conflicts in the world, regardless of region or religion. Women and girls are those who suffer the consequences most. War invades their lives, threatening their sense of security. In this context, as an elected member of the Security Council, a country with a long-standing participation in various peacekeeping operations and an active troop contributor, Uruguay is intent on fighting sexual exploitation and abuse in armed conflicts. We are deeply committed to the zero-tolerance policy. We reiterate our support for this policy and are working very hard to prevent new cases of abuse and sexual exploitation in peacekeeping operations, with the understanding that a single case is one too many. For more than 50 years, Uruguay knew what it was like to be outside the most important decision-making body in the world. That is why we believe it is vital that the issues taken up by the Security Council be public knowledge for all Members of the United Nations. What is discussed there is of such importance that all States present here today should be aware of what goes on behind closed doors. That is why Uruguay will continue working towards more transparent and inclusive working methods in the United Nations within the framework of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, as well as in other multilateral contexts. As a signatory to the Charter of the United Nations, Uruguay emphasizes its commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations while committing itself to working tirelessly to sustain those principles, which we believe are vital for building a safer and more prosperous future. We cannot even think of peace in the world if the international community does not make a serious commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation. Any progress in disarmament and non-proliferation â?? be it serious commitments; gradual, effective, specific steps forward; or results â?? must be welcomed and celebrated as a tremendous achievement of the United Nations. We wish to conclude our statement by highlighting the overarching historical significance of the peace process that has been gaining ground in Colombia and putting an end to the armed conflicts that divided it, drowning it in pain and blood for many long decades. As Uruguayans, as Latin Americans and, in this case, as the then President of the Security Council, we are pleased and proud to have made a modest contribution to the building of peace in Colombia. This is the best example we have when we talk about specific results. It is our Latin America that we have made a region of peace today. The great note of hope that has sounded when this ceasefire and the peace agreement were reached gives us the enthusiasm we need to take on the new and difficult missions in other parts of the world in which the way out often seems difficult to see. Latin America has single-mindedly rejected all attempts to resolve internal conflicts in Latin America, no matter how intense they are, through military intervention. In the historical experience of our continent, such interventions have only left a trail of lasting violence, poverty and instability. Latin America is united as a block against interventionist war-mongering endeavours that are neither rational nor prudent. I would like to reiterate once again our emphatic rejection of the unfair blockade which, after 55 years, is still looming over our sister Republic of Cuba, and we express our sympathy and condolences in connection with the victims of the hurricanes and earthquakes that recently affected the region. In conclusion, achieving a sustainable planet and a decent life requires the effective use of existing resources so that we can live in peace and security and our legacy can be a habitable world for future generations.",1,196
7884,Session 72 - 2017,USA_72_2017.txt,USA_72_2017,72,2017,USA,"I welcome everyone to New York. It is a profound honour to stand here in my home city as a representative of the American people to address the people of the world. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in the Hall who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before. Fortunately, the United States of America has done very well since election day, last 8 November. The stock market is at an all-time high. That is a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time, and it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defence. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before the Assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve. But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this organ not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humankind. Authoritarian Powers seek to collapse the values, systems and alliances that have prevented conflict and tilted the world towards freedom since the Second World War. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons and people; force dislocation and mass migration; and threaten our borders. New forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens. To put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear. This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It is based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe, based on the three beautiful pillars of peace, sovereignty and security, and prosperity. The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, â??Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nationsâ??. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its Members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world. We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of Government, but we do expect all nations to uphold the two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. That is the beautiful vision of this institution, and it is the foundation for cooperation and success. Strong sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. Strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God. In America, we seek not to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. That timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law. The greatest part of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are â??We the peopleâ??. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power but to give power to the American people, where it belongs. In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our Governmentâ??s first duty is to its people, to our citizens; to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just as the leaders of the countries present will always and should always put their countries first. All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation State remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies, but we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into one-sided deals where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold my office, I will defend Americaâ??s interest above all else; but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it is in everyoneâ??s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great Hall. Americaâ??s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside our allies. From the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia, it is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead we helped to build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity of all. For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values. That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in the Hall. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. Will we slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow? If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfil our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow. And, just as the founders of this organ intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror. The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more. We were all witness to the regimeâ??s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictatorâ??s brother, using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Koreaâ??s spies. If that were not twisted enough, now North Koreaâ??s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able but, hopefully, that will not be necessary. That is what the United Nations is all about. That is what the United Nations is for. Let us see how they do. It is time for North Korea to realize that denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-to-nothing votes, adopting hard-hitting resolutions against the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea. I would like to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. I thank all who were involved, but we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behaviour. We face that decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime â?? one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations represented in the Hall today. The Iranian Government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue State whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iranâ??s leaders are in fact its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hizbullah and other terrorists who kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbours. That wealth, which rightly belongs to Iranâ??s people, also goes to shore up Bashar Al-Assadâ??s dictatorship, fuel Yemenâ??s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue such destabilizing activities, while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear programme. The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States â?? and I do not think that the Assembly has heard the last of it, believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iranâ??s Government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all the Americans and citizens of other nations whom they have unjustly detained. Above all, Iranâ??s Government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbours. The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iranâ??s people are what their leaders fear the most. That is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nationâ??s proud roots as a centre of civilization, culture and wealth, where people can be happy and prosperous once again? The Iranian regimeâ??s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbours to fight terrorism and halt its financing. In Saudi Arabia, early last year, I was greatly honoured to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agree that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and, indeed, to tear up the entire world. We must deny terrorists safe haven, transit, funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries that support and finance terror groups, such as Al-Qaida, Hizbullah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people. The United States and its allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush loser terrorists and stop the re-emergence of the safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against that evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests â?? not the arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians â?? will dictate the length and scope of military operations. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains towards lasting defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many years combined. We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honours the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar Al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens, even innocent children, shocked the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the air base that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in the areas liberated from ISIS. We especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars to help support that effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help those horribly treated and enable their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to host countries in the region and we support the recent agreements of the Group of 20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. That is the safe, responsible and humanitarian approach. For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries. For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reforms and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms. For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and Government. I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations- and the African Union-led peacekeeping missions have made invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programmes like the Presidentâ??s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Presidentâ??s Malaria Initiative, the Global Health Security Agenda, the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which is part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe. We also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity. Too often the focus of the Organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, States that seek to subvert this institutionâ??s noble ends have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some Governments with egregious human rights records sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council. The United States is one of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 per cent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it. Major portions of the world are in conflict, and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this Hall, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden â?? militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. That is why, in the western hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My Administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban Government until it makes fundamental reforms. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of NicolÃ¡s Maduro Moros has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule. The Venezuelan people are starving, and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable, and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbour and friend, we, together with all others, have a goal: to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this Hall for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the Government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our peoples and all of our neighbours. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of those discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under those cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a Government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity. In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but that trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules, and our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind. But they are forgotten no more, and they will never be forgotten again. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every Government: the duty to our citizens. This bond is the source of Americaâ??s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. If the Organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its Members. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit. In remembering the great victory that led to this bodyâ??s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they love. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies. We cannot do it. We must solve our problems to build our prosperity, to secure our future, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one: are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens? One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security and prosperity for all. Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humankind and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and a world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all, a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul. So let this be our mission and let this be our message to the world: we will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humankind and for the Almighty God who made us all. God bless the nations of the world and God bless the United States of America.",1,196
7885,Session 72 - 2017,UZB_72_2017.txt,UZB_72_2017,72,2017,UZB,"Allow me to express my sincere gratitude for this opportunity to speak from the high rostrum of the United Nations. A few weeks ago, our people widely celebrated the twenty-sixth anniversary of Uzbekistanâ??s independence. Today Uzbekistan is rapidly developing. While carefully preserving the wisdom of past generations, we are consciously moving forward with resolute reforms and are committed to creating a new image of the country. Political activity is growing and in-depth reforms are being implemented in all spheres. Their goal is to forge a democratic State and a just society, where the priority is the implementation of a simple and clear principle: human interests come first. Following the results of nationwide discussions, the five-year development strategy for Uzbekistan was adopted. While developing it, we looked at ourselves from outside, so as to not only objectively assess our potential and the opportunities before us, but also to pay close attention to our failures and mistakes. The strategy is a programme of real actions for renewal; it is already being put into practice. We have declared 2017 the Year of Dialogue with People and Human Interests in our country. Our goal is to strengthen the mechanisms that would make peopleâ??s power in the country not nominal, but real. We are deeply convinced that it is not the people who must serve the Government bodies, but rather the Government bodies that must serve the people. We have established one Virtual and many Peopleâ??s Reception Offices of the President all over the country. Over 1 million citizens have been able to resolve their urgent problems with the help of those offices. In cooperation with the International Labour Organization, we have taken effective measures to eradicate child labour and forced labour. Following the visit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Al Hussein, a programme of measures to strengthen guarantees for the protection of human rights was developed. We have abolished outdated legacies of the past such as exit visas, which impeded the freedom of movement. An open dialogue with national and international non-governmental organizations on the protection of human rights is being intensified. Proceeding from the principles of humanism, many individual cases of detained persons have been reviewed. Misguided citizens who fell under the influence of the ideology of extremism are undergoing social rehabilitation, and conditions are being created for their return to normal life. The activities of all law- enforcement agencies in terms of protection of human rights and freedoms are under constant parliamentary and civil supervision. The role of political parties and civil society is growing, and the genuine independence of the judiciary is being ensured. The role of the mass media has significantly increased. The most important direction for reforms is the liberalization of our economic system and the creation of a favourable investment climate. We base ourselves on one simple truth: the richer the people are, the stronger the State will be. Since the beginning of the month, Uzbekistan has completely switched to a system of free conversion of the national currency. Along with that, all the necessary measures have been taken to mitigate any possible negative consequences for the population. For the first time, an institute of the ombudsman for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs was established. Taxes on business were significantly reduced. Access of business to credit was expanded. New free economic zones have been launched, where investors are granted extensive benefits. Cooperation with international financial institutions is being successfully developed, and partnership with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been renewed. I want to note that the contents of the strategy are fully consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We are convinced that the United Nations must continue to play a central role in international relations. Uzbekistan champions its gradual reform. We believe that, in keeping with the realities of the modern world, the Security Council needs to be expanded. We support the steps taken by the new leadership of the United Nations to improve its management system. I want to reaffirm that Uzbekistan will continue its close partnership with United Nations structures. We are determined to ensure the practical implementation of the road map that was developed following the recent visit of the Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, to Uzbekistan. Today Uzbekistan considers the region of Central Asia the main priority for its foreign policy, and that is a conscious choice. Lying at the heart of Central Asia, Uzbekistan is keenly interested in seeing the region become a zone of stability, sustainable development and good-neighbourliness. A peaceful and economically prosperous Central Asia is our most important goal and key task. Uzbekistan is determined to engage in dialogue, constructive interaction and strengthening good- neighbourliness. We are open to reasonable compromise with the countries of Central Asia on all issues without exception. Thanks to joint efforts in the region in recent months, political confidence has significantly increased. Fundamentally important decisions on many issues have been made. The signing of the treaty on the State border between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in early September was a truly landmark event. A breakthrough in that very sensitive issue, achieved for the first time in 26 years, became possible as a result of the political will demonstrated by both parties and their readiness to find mutually acceptable solutions. In a word, an absolutely new political atmosphere has been created in the region in a short period. I believe that holding regular consultation meetings of the heads of Central Asian States would facilitate the consolidation of this trend. We intend to discuss the fundamental problems of the region at the high- level international conference on the theme â??Central Asia: one past and common future, cooperation for sustainable development and mutual prosperityâ??, to be held in November in Samarkand under the auspices of the United Nations. Based on its results, we intend to make a proposal on the adoption of a special General Assembly draft resolution in support of the efforts of Central Asia to ensure security and enhancing regional cooperation. We count on support for that proposal by the leadership of the United Nations and the international community. When speaking about the problems of ensuring security and stability in Central Asia, one cannot overlook an issue as important as the joint use of the regionâ??s shared water resources. We fully share the position of the Secretary-General that the problems of â??water, peace and security are inextricably linkedâ??. I am convinced that there is no alternative to addressing the problem of water besides equally taking into account the interests of the countries and nations of the region. Uzbekistan supports the draft conventions on the use of water resources of the Amudarya and Syrdarya river basins, which were developed by the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy. I would like to once again draw the Assemblyâ??s attention to one of the most acute environmental problems of our time: the Aral Sea catastrophe. I am holding a map showing the Aral Sea tragedy â?? I believe that words are not necessary. Overcoming the consequences of the drying up of the sea requires the active consolidation of international efforts. We stand for the full implementation of the special United Nations programme to provide effective assistance to the population affected by the Aral Sea crisis, which was adopted this year. The stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan is an important precondition to ensure not only regional security, but global security as well. We are convinced that the only way to peace in Afghanistan is a direct dialogue between the central Government and the main domestic political forces, held without preconditions. The negotiations should be Afghan-led, held on the territory of Afghanistan and under the auspices of the United Nations. The wise Afghan people have the right to independently define their own destiny. We support the appeal of the Administration of United States President Donald Trump to Afghanistanâ??s neighbouring States to promote the peace process and an inter-Afghan settlement. Uzbekistan will continue to contribute to the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as to the development of its transport and energy infrastructure and the training of national personnel. I am convinced that Afghanistan must remain at the heart of the global agenda. The efforts of the international community should primarily be aimed at resolving the acute social and economic problems of Afghanistan. Our common determination to promote peace in such a long-suffering country should not wane. The aggravation of terrorist threats in the world, especially in recent years, indicates that the use of primarily forceful methods of counteraction is not justified. Often, efforts are reduced to combating the consequences of challenges, rather than addressing their root causes. I believe that, along with other factors, ignorance and intolerance are at the heart of international terrorism and extremism. In that regard, the most important task is to fight for the minds of people, especially young people. Most of the crimes linked with extremist activity and violence are committed by the people under the age of 30. Todayâ??s youth is the largest generation in the history of humankind, totalling 2 billion people. The planetâ??s future and well-being depend upon what kind of people our children will grow up to be. Our task is to provide conditions for the self- realization of the youth and create a barrier against the spread of the virus of the ideology of violence. We believe that, in order to achieve that, we need to develop necessary multilateral cooperation in the sphere of social support of the younger generation and bolster the protection of their rights and interests. In that regard, Uzbekistan proposes to develop a United Nations international convention on the rights of youth, which would constitute a unified, international legal instrument aimed at the development and implementation of youth policy, taking into account the conditions of globalization and the rapid development of information and communication technologies. In our opinion, States that accede to the convention would make firm commitments in order to raise the level of awareness with regard to one of the main, vital priorities of their social policies. We consider communicating the humanistic essence of Islam to the broader world community to be one of the most important tasks at hand. We cherish our sacred religion as the focal point of time-honoured values. We strongly condemn and will never agree with those who equate our great faith with violence and bloodshed. Islam calls upon us to be kind and peaceful. It calls for the preservation of genuine humanity. I would like to especially note the invaluable contribution of a whole line of outstanding members of the Central Asian renaissance to the development of the Islamic and world civilization. One of them, Muhammad al-Bukhari, is acclaimed all over the world as the author of Sahih al-Bukhari, the second-most important book in Islam after the Qurâ??an. In order to preserve and study his richest legacy and disseminate his teachings on enlightened Islam, we decided to establish the Imam Al-Bukhari International Research Center in Samarkand. The activities of the Center for Islamic Civilization, which is being established in Tashkent, will contribute to the implementation of that task. I would like to address the participants at this meeting with a proposal to adopt a special draft resolution of the General Assembly on education and religious tolerance. Its main goal would be to promote universal access to education and eradicate illiteracy and ignorance. It would be designed to promote tolerance and mutual respect, ensure religious freedom, protect the rights of believers and prevent discrimination against them. While steadfastly maintaining its non-aligned status, Uzbekistan is open to dialogue. We are interested in expanding cooperation with all partners in the name of peace, progress and prosperity. We see that cooperation as a vital precondition for the successful implementation of the most important tasks of reform carried out in our country, the main focus of which is people, their needs and their interests.",1,196
7886,Session 72 - 2017,VAT_72_2017.txt,VAT_72_2017,72,2017,VAT,"On behalf of His Holiness Pope Francis, I am pleased to congratulate Your Excellency on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to commend you on the choice of the theme for the general debate: â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.â?? It is a congenial topic for the Holy See. Pope Francis never tires of insisting on people first, especially those who suffer, those who are excluded, marginalized or left behind. The Catholic Church expresses the meaning of focusing on people in these words: the joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men and women of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ, because, indeed, nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in our hearts. Focusing on people means not only protecting them from heinous crimes, but also placing them ahead of all national and geopolitical interests and fulfilling all the international political commitments undertaken throughout the history of the United Nations relating to social and economic development, starting with those set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Always putting people first means protecting, at every stage and in every circumstance, the dignity of the person, human rights, fundamental freedoms and, in a specific way, the rights to life and to freedom of religion, from which all other rights flow. These two human rights are the common foundation of the pillars of peace, security and integral human development. They are indivisible from those other rights and fundamental freedoms relating to a dignified, spiritual, material and intellectual life for all citizens and their families, including, inter alia, the right to food, water, housing, a safe environment and work. With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the international community committed itself to effective measures to eradicate the root causes of various evils and indignities that many people in the world are facing today. Moments before the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Pope Francis defined the Agenda as an important sign of hope. One of the fundamental reasons for this hope is that world leaders had agreed on a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity and were determined to end poverty and hunger in all their forms and manifestations and to ensure that all human beings could fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment. Their common resolve to leave no one behind articulates the core of this focus on people. With regard to political commitments, Pope Francis has also urged the Organization and the international community not to fall into what could be called â??declarationist nominalismâ??. Accordingly, we must guard against having soothed consciences and feeling good simply because we adopted the 2030 Agenda and other important international accords. On the contrary, we must not rest until our legal commitments have been truly fulfilled and our political promises kept when it comes to the lives of people. We must therefore take a hard and honest look at the principal challenges that the peoples of the world are facing today and will face tomorrow. With this in mind, responsible compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, as well as the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda, could be a way of focusing all countries and international organizations on working together for peace, setting aside the dangerous game of exchanging threats. From this perspective, the Holy See sees the forthcoming reform and fine-tuning of the United Nations development system as an additional opportunity for placing people and their needs at the centre of our action. In so doing so, as Pope Francis reminded us in this Hall two years ago, we must allow them to be dignified agents of their own destiny. Christian churches, in particular the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, celebrate together on 1 September the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation to heighten public awareness of their shared responsibility to take care of our common home and contribute to reversing environmental degradation. To mark the World Day of Prayer this year, Pope Francis and the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I released a joint message affirming that the Earth was entrusted to us as a sublime gift and legacy for which all of us share responsibility. Our human dignity and welfare are deeply connected to our care for the whole of creation. This call for responsible stewardship finds particular urgency before the deteriorating conditions of our common home and an often purely utilitarian world view concerning the things that surround us. Any harm done to the environment is harm done to humankind today and tomorrow. Therefore, the misuse and destruction of the environment are also accompanied by a relentless process of exclusion, given that the deterioration of the planet affects, first and foremost, the many billions trapped in poverty or in conditions of environmental stress across the globe. This dramatic reality of exclusion and inequality must lead all of us to take stock of our shared and individualresponsibilities. The pressing call and challenge to care for creation invite all humankind to work unhesitatingly towards sustainable and integral development. Improving climate conditions and the natural environment is possible only if we accept the need to change the way we perceive the world and thus our way of relating to it. Although our common home is falling into serious disrepair, we can reverse the trend of environmental degradation. Indeed, as Pope Francis emphasized in his encyclical Laudato si \ while we are capable of the worst, we are also capable of the best, rising above ourselves, choosing again what is good and making a new start. The duty to prevent wars and violent conflicts is an essential component of the responsibility to protect. The Holy See therefore appreciates the Secretary-Generalâ??s explicit and strong emphasis on preventive diplomacy and concurs with his assessment that the most serious shortcoming of the entire international community is the frequent inability to prevent crises. Prevention requires, first of all, restoring faith in the capacity of humankind for dialogue. An environment of trust is urgently needed. All countries should take a decisive and urgent step back from the present escalation of military preparations. The largest countries and those that have a stronger tradition of respecting human rights should be the first to perform generous actions of pacification. All diplomatic and political means of mediation should be engaged in order to avoid the unspeakable. Allow me to recall the appeal of Pope Pius XII to all nations on 24 August 1939, on the eve of the Second World War: â??The way of justice is promoted by the strength of reason and not with the force of arms... The danger is imminent, but there is still time. Nothing is lost with peace. With war, everything is lost. May people come back to understand each other and take up again negotiations. By negotiating with good will and with respect for mutual rights, they will realize that sincere and active negotiations never preclude an honourable success.â?? In such a context, I would like to recall that a dozen years have passed since the historica gathering of world leaders in this Hall for the 2005 World Summit. Focusing on people, the Heads of State and Government of the Members of the Organization reached consensus on the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. There is no doubt that a collective political consensus is necessary, but a reflection on Articles 2, paragraph 7 and 39 of the Charter of the United Nations is also needed. The Holy See therefore supports all initiatives designed to facilitate observing obligations under the responsibility to protect, but it would like to remind the international community once again that without a legal framework or fair respect of the international rule of law, the application of the principle is unfeasible. The war in Yemen is causing a humanitarian catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. The tragedy stemming from the war in Syria continues to grow every day. Involved stakeholders should sit at the United Nations negotiating table with the sole precondition that human rights law and principles be respected and that humanitarian access and assistance be allowed. At the same time, States, especially those that at some time in recent history have been directly or indirectly involved in the conflict, must undertake all means to reach a ceasefire, which is a first step towards peace. The Holy See is particularly concerned about the political divisions and instability in Venezuela and its humanitarian crisis. In addition, the international community must address the complex political and diplomatic tensions in the Arabian peninsula, as well as the violence and the various humanitarian situations in the Middle East. We must all strive for an end to violence and for reaching a solution that can enable both Palestinians and Israelis alike to live at last in peace within clearly established and internationally recognized borders, thus implementing the two- State solution. The ongoing violence and intense political tension in the Democratic Republic of the Congo necessitate an urgent and efficient commitment from all parties to finding a solution to the constitutional crisis. Furthermore, there is a need for greater public awareness of certain ongoing conflict situations with a view to reaching negotiated and peaceful solutions to them, especially in Ukraine, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, inter alia. Along the same lines, as Pope Francis has stated, there is â??another kind of conflict that is not always so explicit and yet is silently killing millions of people. Many of our societies experience a different kind of war as a result of the drug tradeâ??. The drug trade has joined other forms of corruption and has â??penetrated into every level of life â?? social, political, military, artistic and religious â?? and in many cases has given rise to a parallel structure that threatens the credibility of our institutionsâ??. In a similar vein, the Holy See is concerned with the challenges of fighting corruption and terrorism and with promoting stable peace and a sustainable development in many countries of the world. The Holy See wishes to stress again that terrorism can be countered only by more cohesive and coherent measures at the international level: as terror knows no border, the international community must act as a whole. The full protection of people is possible only with a durable peace. However, the protection of civilian populations must also be ensured during times of war The recent gangrenous conflicts both weaken and reveal the shortcomings of the international order and cause inexplicable suffering, massive displacements, blatant violations of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms and extreme poverty. There is no worse manmade crisis than violent conflicts. They drive people forcibly to migrate or become refugees. They engender mass atrocities and crimes against humanity. Indeed, as Pope Francis told the Assembly, â??War is the negation of all rightsâ??. The lamentable situation of the hundreds of millions of migrants and refugees fleeing from wars, persecution, natural disasters and extreme poverty, particularly in Nigeria, Myanmar, Somalia and countries of the sub-Saharan region, inter alia, is a great responsibility for all without exception. Our common humanity compels us all, as Pope Francis has proposed, to welcome, protect, promote and integrate those who flee from such adverse conditions. These four actions are based on the proposition that migrants, despite many real or imagined challenges, are good for society, and on the principle of solidarity with those in need. In particular, they express our shared responsibility towards the victims of the genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity that the international community has failed to prevent or stop, in blatant neglect of the principles of international law. The Holy See will vigorously work to see these four concepts enshrined and reflected in the future Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees. The Holy See believes that these United Nations-led processes offer a unique opportunity to respond collectively to challenges through international cooperation and shared responsibility. The Holy See urges the international community to overcome the current political impasse and go beyond the negative sentiments that we face in opening safe, orderly and regular pathways for migration. In order to achieve the desired outcome, the contribution of political communities, civil society and all stakeholders is indispensable, each according to their respective responsibilities. While some migrants may be motivated by the legitimate desire to improve their already acceptable situations, most would likely choose not to migrate if they enjoyed peace and economic security in their home countries. It is a basic human right to live in oneâ??s own country, but that right is effective only if the root causes that force people to migrate, such as wars and conflicts, mass atrocities and persecutions, and dire economic and environmental hardships, are met with adequate solutions. Indeed, if basic necessary conditions were met, people would not feel forced to leave their homes, making migration manageable and voluntary. The focus in negotiating the Compacts therefore should not be limited to stopping migrants in their tracks or confining refugees to camps, but, instead, it should address the causes that deprive them of living with dignity and force them to make life-threatening journeys. This should be our goal, and it should be a key part of the Global Compact for Migration. Another great challenge facing the international community is trafficking in persons. At the root of this and other contemporary forms of slavery are wars and conflicts, extreme poverty, underdevelopment and exclusion, lack of education or employment opportunities and environmental catastrophes. But we ought to recognize that on the demand side of such criminal trafficking there is also a crass selfishness that reaches the unimaginable heights of moral irresponsibility in the case of the trafficking of children, organs, tissues and embryos and in so-called transplant tourism. Such execrable forms of trade are exacerbated by corruption on the part of publicofficials and common people willing to do anything for financial gain. Indeed, the migration and refugee crises are today facilitating an increase in trafficking in persons and other contemporary forms of slavery. The Holy See and the Catholic Church have long spoken out against the evil of trafficking in persons and, through the dedicated work of so many individuals and institutions, have sought to fight its root causes, care for the victims, raise awareness about this scourge and work with anyone and everyone to try to eliminate it. In an address on 10 April 2014, at the International Conference on Combating Human Trafficking, Pope Francis called trafficking in persons an â??open wound on the body of contemporary societyâ?? and at the signing of the Universal Declaration Against Slavery, on 2 December 2014, he termed it an â??atrocious scourge that is present throughout the world on a broad scaleâ??. At the heart of this evil is the utter loss of respect for human dignity and the total indifference to the sufferings of fellow human beings. Modern slavery happens when people are treated as objects, which leads to their being deceived, raped, often sold and resold for various purposes, and in the end either killed or left devastated in mind and body, only to be finally thrown away or abandoned. By refocusing its attention on people and putting people first in its overall work, the Organization should unerringly support the fight against trafficking in persons and other contemporary forms of slavery. Pope Francis calls on everyone, and especially the competent authorities, to address this heinous crime through effective legal instruments, punish those who benefit from it, assist in the healing and the reintegration of its victims and eradicate its root causes. Our response must be commensurate with this great evil of our time. The world is awash in all types of weapons, from nuclear weapons to small arms and light weapons. The arms trade, both licit and illicit, keeps on growing. The proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction, among terrorist groups and other non-State actors has become a real danger. These trends are deeply worrying, but more disturbing still is the deep chasm that separates commitments made from actions taken in the field of disarmament and arms control. While everyone condemns the grave effects of arms proliferation, nothing has substantially changed on the ground, because, as Pope Francis has observed, â??[W]e say the words â??no more war!â??, but at the same time we manufacture weapons and sell them ... to those who are at war with one anotherâ??. This must change. The proliferation of weapons simply aggravates situations of conflict and results in unimaginable human suffering and material costs, profoundly undermining development, human rights and the search for lasting peace. Without greater international and regional cooperation, especially among weapon-producing States, in terms of strictly controlling and limiting the production and movement of weapons, a world free of wars and violent conflicts will surely remain an illusion. When Pope Francis addressed the General Assembly two years ago today, he drew attention to the urgent need to â??work hard for a world free of nuclear weapons by implementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in letter and in spirit, until such instruments are totally bannedâ?? (ibid., p. 5). In his 2017 World Day of Peace Message, Pope Francis once again made a plea for disarmament and for the prohibition and abolition of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the proliferation of nuclear weapons continues to increase international tensions, as can be seen in the situation on the Korean peninsula. As history shows, regional and bilateral treaties on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons have been effective in establishing whole regions free from these weapons. It therefore seems all the more urgent that we invest in creating those circumstances that would facilitate the crafting of new bilateral and regional treaties. The Holy See has signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and has already deposited its ratification document because it believes that it is an important contribution to the overall effort towards total and complete nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, that it represents progress toward the fulfilment of the commitment of the States parties to the Treaty to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and a step towards negotiating a general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. While much remains to be done for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to truly make a difference and fulfil its full promise, the Holy Seebelieves that it is one more blow on the anvil towards the fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah: â??They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks; one nation shall not raise the sword against another, nor shall they train for war again.â??",1,196
7887,Session 72 - 2017,VCT_72_2017.txt,VCT_72_2017,72,2017,VCT,"Our Organization was founded amid the still glowing embers and simmering tensions of global war. In the shadows of widespread death and destruction, the nations of the world united in recognition of the fact that global challenges can be overcome only through collective action and international law, not misguided unilateralism or short-sighted self-interest. That recognition remains as valid today as it was 72 years ago, even as new threats to life and development have joined armed conflict as challenges demanding a concerted international response. On behalf of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, I would like to express our stand in solidarity with the Government and the people of Mexico as they are suffering the devastating effects of yet another earthquake. As I speak before the Assembly today, the island of Dominica has been levelled by a direct hit from Hurricane Maria, even as it was continuing to recover from the widespread devastation wrought by Tropical Storm Erika two years ago. No individual there has been spared. A series of hurricanes â?? Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria â?? of unprecedented intensity have struck the peoples of our region with unerring accuracy and rapidity. The States and territories affected include the United States, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, Cuba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Saint Martin, Puerto Rico and, today, the Turks and Caicos Islands. In a period of five weeks, each of those countries and territories has been struck with a force comparable to that of a weapon of mass destruction. Hundreds of people are dead. The damage to infrastructure, while still being calculated, is already estimated at more than $130 billion. The current Atlantic hurricane season is likely to be the most expensive in history. In terms of development, the countries affected will take years, if not decades, to recover from the devastating battering. Let us make no mistake: the death and destruction wrought by this hurricane season are not merely the result of freak weather events or vengeful acts of God. They are the direct result of the acts and omissions of humankind. They are manifestations of climate change and the symptoms of the prescient predictions made by the overwhelming majority of scientists. Today almost every year is hotter than the preceding one; almost every hurricane season more intense; and almost every storm, drought and flood more destructive than its predecessors. It is a barefaced insult to the intelligence and experience of the peoples of island States and coastal areas to call climate change a hoax. At this point, it is almost a clichÃ© to reaffirm that small island developing States are the most vulnerable to climate change while contributing the least to the emissions that cause it. But that truism is the foundation of our just, urgent and unavoidable demand that the nations that have contributed most to climate change should also do the most to mitigate its effects and assist others in adapting to our dangerous new realities. Our global community, in the great tradition of the United Nations and in the spirit of the founders of this Organization, came together through hard-fought negotiations to craft the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, an ambitious if imperfect agreement designed to arrest climate change and assist those most affected by it. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views any attempt to disavow the freshly minted commitments of the Paris Agreement as an act of hostility, and we draw a direct, causal connection between any such abdication and the future death and destruction that island States face as the result of increasingly frequent and intense weather events. The independent countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Cuba, the Bahamas and Dominica require the special and sustained support of the international community. These countries need immediate and massive assistance with both immediate relief and long-term reconstruction. That assistance should be concessional and free from antiquated notions of per capita gross domestic product. We therefore join other countries in calling for a donor conference to address the daunting challenges that those countries face. Only together can we recover. Additionally, the Caribbean territories with special relationships to colonial Powers in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are in desperate need of assistance and have limited options for international cooperation, given their unique political status. Despite our small size and limited means, the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have already sent emergency assistance to these territories, as well as technical expertise. We urge administering Powers and potential donors alike to look past political issues and look instead to the needs of the affected peoples and communities. We also call on the colonial Powers to accept their full responsibility for the recovery and rehabilitation of these territories. The rise of climate change as an existential threat of our era has not replaced the persistent peril of armed conflict across the globe. The human suffering in Syria, Yemen and Myanmar demands greater international attention and action. Similarly, the potential threats to international peace and security posed by tensions on the Korean peninsula, among the Gulf States and in the State of Palestine require persistent and prioritized diplomacy. Diplomacy, though difficult, is always preferable to the alternative. The United Nations was founded and continues to exist on that fundamental premise. Frustration with the pace of negotiation and mediation cannot give way to the intemperate urge to impose quick military fixes on inherently political problems. Nor can it lead to an illogical interpretation of sovereign self- interest that justifies trampling on the sovereignty of other States. Sovereignty is not a sword but a shield. The United Nations is not a forum for measuring whose sovereignty is bigger, or whose military is better equipped to pursue its narrow, short-term self-interest. We are a community founded instead on the assumption of the sovereign equality of all States, rich and poor, large and small. One nationâ??s ability to destroy another does not endow it with special rights, but rather profound responsibilities, chief among them restraint. President Theodore Rooseveltâ??s realpolitik adage of speaking softly while carrying a big stick â?? whatever its limitations â?? cannot be replaced by irresponsible, bellicose sabre-rattling that inches us closer to the types of conflict that the Assembly was created to prevent. In that context. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views with alarm the continued threats to the sovereignty of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To be sure, the people of Venezuela have endured an extended period of political conflict, which has exacerbated other difficulties in the country. But with illegal street violence dwindling and all political parties committed to the upcoming gubernatorial elections, the interventionist option increasingly floated by the United States and an imprudent Secretary General of the Organization of American States have no place in a modern Latin America. Similarly, any threat, expressed or implied, to the sovereignty of the peaceful and noble Cuban people is an anachronistic throwback to Cold War posturing without any logical justification, particularly in the light of the recent dÃ©tente between the Governments of Cuba and the United States. Let us be clear. Latin America and the Caribbean is a zone of peace. There is no conflict, challenge or disagreement in our region that requires military intervention in any way, shape or form, be it covert, overt or by proxy. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is resolutely and implacably opposed to any attempt to foment external interference or interventionist activities against any nation in our hemisphere. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was honoured to host the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar on decolonization, consistent with our responsibilities as one of the many Caribbean and Pacific small island States and former colonies in Africa and Asia whose self-determination was achieved under the watchful eye of the United Nations. The inconvenient truth is that the decolonization process remains incomplete, and it will be essential to intensify our efforts to achieve the goal of full self-government through the attainment of a legitimate political status option providing for absolute political equality. That principle must be the guiding standard applicable to the small island territories, just as it was the standard for decolonizing other former colonies. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains fully seized of this issue and was pleased to play its part in completing the unfinished business of decolonization by hosting the 2017 seminar and previous seminars in 2011 and 2005. It is in that spirit that we have great sympathy for the legitimate aspiration of the people of West Papua to freedom and independence and to govern themselves and guide their own destiny through legitimate political means. The issue of United Nations reform has justifiably gained momentum in recent months. As a large, aging bureaucracy, the United Nations has not demonstrated the nimbleness and responsiveness it needs for our new and fast-paced modern challenges. However, the areas demanding the most immediate and far-reaching reforms are not budgetary allocations or staffing matters but rather the political and organizational underpinnings of the most fossilized structures of the United Nations and the wider international architecture. The litmus test for any serious talk of United Nations reform is reform of the Security Council. Those who pay lip service to reform while ignoring the need for a reformed Council â?? with expanded permanent membership, a special voice for island States and radically revised working methods â?? are simply engaging in an exercise where they attempt to reduce their financial responsibilities while maintaining an unjustifiable grip on disproportionate and outmoded power arrangements. Similarly, the lessons of the global economic and financial crisis have yet to be implemented. Our inactivity has produced an extended period of halting and uneven recovery and an iniquitous globalization whose unequal distribution of benefits and burdens is spurring a popular backlash worldwide. The General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council must squarely and frontally address reforms to our international financial architecture, in particular the Bretton Woods institutions. For Caribbean States, the issue of declining correspondent banking relationships is a grave and gathering threat to our continued growth and ongoing connections to the global economy. The United Nations, the Group of 20 and international financial institutions cannot shirk this issue as a private banking matter. It is a threat to development of the highest priority, and it demands a coordinated, political solution. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds the Presidentâ??s sustained focus on sustainable development. Our Government has located the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the centre of its national development strategies. In the areas of climate change, pollution and biodiversity, we have banned Styrofoam products and turtle-hunting, tightened restrictions on internationally permitted indigenous whaling activity and implemented new coastal protection regulations. We are investing heavily in geothermal and solar energy and expect to generate 80 per cent of our energy needs from renewable sources within the next three years. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is also dedicating special funding to technology-based entrepreneurs, improving wages and occupational health and safety legislation and investing in new modem medical facilities. We have launched an innovative zero-hunger fund with interventions targeting food insecurity and unemployment in vulnerable populations, while simultaneously creating a contingency fund to aid in disaster recovery efforts. We are serious and committed to the achievement of all the SDGs by the year 2030. Nonetheless, as the President and the Secretary-General have recognized, the achievement of the SDGs requires international cooperation and the commitment of new and additional funding. Ours is the only body that can generate and sustain the necessary political will and resources to give life to the ambition of the SDGs. The link between development and peace is well established, and the link between peace and the United Nations is immutable. A substantial part of the backdrop or context of the continuing socioeconomic challenges of the nation States of our Caribbean civilization is the awful legacy of underdevelopment that European colonialism has bequeathed to us as a consequence of native genocide and African slavery. The international campaign for reparations from the former colonial Powers in order to assist in repairing this malignant legacy is urgent and timely. It deserves the full support of the Assembly, particularly within this decade which has been declared to be focused on the uplifting of persons of African descent. I repeat yet again the necessity and desirability for the responsible authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United Nations to address properly, and once and for all, the respective issues of the denial of citizenship for persons of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic and the cholera epidemic that some United Nations troops in Haiti initiated. In the quest for deepening multilateralism, international cooperation and peace, the glaring injustice of the continuing denial of Taiwanâ??s membership in the special agencies of the United Nations demands correction. The ghosts of a divisive past ought to be laid to rest. Taiwanâ??s legitimate incorporation into the family of nations is long overdue. How can we neglect or deny 23 billion people who have been contributing so much to developing countries in every sector of their economy? How can we deny them entrance into the organs of the United Nations? It is unfair and unjust and should be remedied. The travails of the people of Palestine arising from the illegal occupation of their lands continue to haunt us globally. The General Assembly has repeatedly pronounced in favour of the rights of the Palestinian people, but the illegal occupiers, backed internationally by a handful of powerful States, have continued to thwart the will of the international community. Peace in the Middle East will remain a mirage unless the national rights of the Palestinian people are recognized and upheld in practice. As we speak in this Hall today, we seek to amplify the echoes of the visionaries of yesteryear who stood at this rostrum to give voice to the system of multilateral cooperation and mutual respect that has defined our post-war existence. New challenges may arise, but the solutions â?? diplomacy, ambitious action and respect for the sovereign equality of all Member States â?? are eternal. Multilateral diplomacy may be messy and imperfect; international law may be frustratingly inconsistent; the path of development may be beset on all sides by natural and man-made obstacles; but, united, we have always been greater than the sum of our individual parts, and together there is no challenge too great for the collective wisdom of our great nations and our great institution. As new challenges confront us, let us hew ever closer to the undeniable strengths of our Organization to make this a better world for all of us.",1,196
7888,Session 72 - 2017,VEN_72_2017.txt,VEN_72_2017,72,2017,VEN,"We address the General Assembly at its seventy-second session in the name of the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro Moros, and thus in the name of a sovereign, peace-loving people that believes in respect among nations and compliance with the purest and truest principles of international law â?? the Bolivarian people of Venezuela. In the nineteenth century, the liberating army of Simon Bolivar left its country not to conquer or dominate, but rather to help brotherly peoples achieve their independence, so that later they could return home with the satisfaction of having been useful in the cause of liberty and equality. That is the spirit that characterizes our people and the actions of our revolutionary Government during such difficult times for humankind. That is why we will always uphold the Bolivarian diplomacy of peace. Indeed, we are in the house of peace, the home of peaceful solutions and the land of international law and its principles. We are embraced and upheld by the Charter of the United Nations, a noble multilateral instrument to avoid war and injustices. Thus this rostrum should be respected, protected and cared for by nations. It is an all but sacred podium for the peoples that espouse peace and understanding. However, this House, one of multilaterialism and respect for the equality of peoples and States, has been defiled, disrespected and offended, time and time again, by arrogant Powers that seek to impose their unilateral rules of the game â?? rules of war, suffering and pain. That was denounced in this very place, in a resounding voice and an incomparable manner, by Commander Hugo Chavez in 2006 (see A/61/PV.12). Everyone will recall his remark, that it smelled of sulphur in here. It continues to smell of sulphur. He tried to sound the alarm to generate the necessary restraint to confront the serious unilateral threats then threatening world peace. Nevertheless, a week ago this Hall (see A/72/ PV.3) â?? and the world, by way of the media â?? bore witness to yet another dangerous desecration of the principles and objectives of the United Nations. The emperor of the world, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, used this platform built for peace to announce wars, the total destruction of Member States and the implementation of unilateral and illegal coercive measures. He threatened and judged at will, as if he had absolute dictatorial powers over the sovereign States Members of our Organization. Paradoxically, in a display of brazenness and political hypocracy, Donald Trump based his attacks against humankind on such values as peace and prosperity. In our case, we recall that former President Barack Obama, who had a different style but the same goal, declared the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security of the United States. That was in an executive order on 9 May 2015. Today, we are obliged to declare before the world that our country was directly threatened by the President of the United States with the use of the most powerful military force that has ever existed in the history of humankind. That was on 11 August this year. As a complement to such anachronism and an offence to our sovereignty and to the peace that has always characterized our Latin America and the Caribbean, the Trump Administration imposed illegal economic sanctions on our economy on 25 August, with a view to making our people suffer and forcing undemocratic changes to our system of government. In his statement last week Donald Trump appealed to the antiquated ideological rhetoric of the Cold War, to the best inquisitorial style of Richard Nixon and Senator Joseph McCarthy, to reiterate his threats against our country and our sister Republic of Cuba. Venezuela will always seek mutually respectful dialogue with the United States Government. However, as the free people that we are, we stand ready to defend our sovereignty, our independence and our democracy in any scenario and by any way. Given such attitudes, the United Nations should establish effective mechanisms to neutralize warlike pretences and intentions to supplant multilaterialism, which has cost us so much to consolidate, with the dictatorial unilateralism of those who intend, through the use of arms and economic blackmail, to impose destruction and a single way of thinking on our diverse and heterogeneous humankind. In that connection, last Tuesday the 120 members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries â?? two thirds of the General Assembly â?? unanimously adopted the Political Declaration of New York as a tool for denunciation, condemnation and joint action against coercive and unilateral measures that certain international actors impose in frank violation of the Charter of the United Nations. In our statement on behalf of the presidency of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the plenary session of the Group of 77 and China last Thursday, we proposed that the New York Political Declaration be extended to that group of countries, which focuses on economic affairs, because the merciless and unilateral attacks against the economies of our peoples form an essential part of those illegal, unilateral and coercive measures. We must urgently seek multilateral responses to avoid the imposition of coercive measures whereby Governments that have imposed them illegally have a legal obligation to compensate the peoples who have suffered from their effects. In that regard, we condemn all unilateral actions against brotherly nations, such as Russia and Iran, in particular the extension of the criminal blockade against the brotherly Republic of Cuba, which has been in effect for more than five decades and, at this time, clearly reflects the new winds of United States unilateralism. Venezuela firmly opposes the existence of nuclear weapons on our planet. Their possession exposes humankind to unimaginable and unjustifiable anguish and risks. We therefore signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last Wednesday. We must make a supreme effort so that nuclear crises are de-escalated and vanish â?? hopefully along with their weapons â?? through dialogue and humanist reason. Inthe areaofhumanrights as well, Venezuelaâ??which over the past several years has worked tirelessly to ensure the broadest form of social investment, redistributing with justice its national wealth among Venezuelan men and women so as to ensure their human and social rights â?? has been targeted and accused by the United States Government. If there is any country that is not worthy of membership in the Human Rights Council, it is precisely the United States of America. It is the main violator of human rights, not only on its own territory, but throughout the world, including through unjustified wars, the bombing of civilian populations, clandestine imprisonment accompanied by various forms of torture, the imposition of unilateral and unlawful measures against economies in several countries, various kinds of economic pressure, and rash migration policies. It is the only country that has dared to use nuclear weapons against another people. It is a country that, violating the fundamental institutional framework of the United Nations, led the invasion of Iraq in 2003 on the grounds that it was searching for weapons of mass destruction that they never found, notwithstanding the more than 1 million deaths caused by that bloody military operation. The United States is building a wall on its border with Mexico, and there is proposed legislation to impose a 7 per cent tax on immigrantsâ?? income to fund not their social security but the construction of that shameful wall. Based on verifiable data from United Nations agencies and rapporteurs, we can note the following. The United States has not ratified 62 per cent of the principal treaties concerning human rights. In the United States, there is no independent institution for the defence and promotion of human rights. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has condemned the lack of independence of the United States judiciary. Solitary confinement is widespread practice in this country. The number of homeless people has reached 3.5 million, including 1.5 million boys and girls. Some 28 per cent of those living in poverty have no health-care coverage. The maternal mortality rate has skyrocketed in recent years. Some 10,000 children are incarcerated in adult prisons, and children can be sentenced to life imprisonment. Of those who have been condemned to life, 70 per cent are African-American. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education has condemned the use of electric shocks and physical coercion in study centres. The United States is one of the seven countries in the world that has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In the United States, paid maternity leave is not mandatory. Allegations of police abuses, inparticular against the African-American community, are commonplace. More than 10 million African Americans continue to live in poverty, half of them live in situations of severe poverty. In a country in which slavery was supposed to have been abolished, the thirteenth amendment allows for slavery in the form of criminal conviction. One in three American indigenous women will undergo rape in her lifetime. We are discussing a country in which racial discrimination is not only unsurpassed, but one in which it is growing alongside the supremacist positions of the current Administration. Please excuse all the details, but there are things that we must know that the media hides. Venezuela condemns terrorism in all its forms, whether perpetrated by the violent anarchist groups that today threaten world peace and stability or by States that assume the right to intervene throughout the world, gaining control of strategic natural resources through the use of military force with no compassion for civilians. It pains us to see how the Mediterranean Sea has become an immense cemetery, often before the blind eye and incompetence of States bearing partial responsibility for the crises generated in the migrantsâ?? countries of origin, owing to a combination of both forms of terrorism. Incited and bloody wars like the prefabricated ones against Syria and Libya only leave behind desolation and division. Fortunately, with the support of their righteous international allies, the heroic Syrian Government and people are coming closer to a definitive victory against terrorist groups every day. Venezuela hopes for the success of the work of the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism in his role as head coordinator of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Venezuela hopes that that work will also condemn State terrorism. Venezuela encourages the resumption of peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel, which must lead to a lasting and durable peace between the two States and recognizing as the borders of Palestine those that existed in 1967, in conformity with international law, as well as establishing East Jerusalem as its capital. We believe that the United Nations must assume a much greater proactive role in resolving that historic and unjust conflict. We thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his sincere efforts in facilitating the implementation of the Geneva Agreement through the good-offices mechanism so as reach a practical solution, satisfactory to the parties, in the case of the ongoing territorial dispute between ourselves and our brothers and neighbours in the cooperative Republic of Guyana. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will always be willing to help open the path of peace. We therefore commend the implementation of the peace agreements between the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, to which both Commander Chavez and President Nicolas Maduro Moros devoted so much energy and effort. Likewise, we will continue to facilitate the talks between the Government of Colombia and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional that are under way in the Republic of Ecuador. Venezuela is not a drug-producing country, as international agencies have certified. We cooperate in a sovereign capacity with all neighbouring and non-neighbouring countries in countering drug trafficking. We express our concern about the increase in drug production in the neighbouring country of Colombia. However, we have always affirmed that consumer countries bear the primary responsibility, as they account for the incentives underlying both drug production and drug trafficking, and they must assume genuine control of the entry and distribution of drugs within their territories. Since we have been working for many years with the United Nations Development Programme, Venezuelaâ??s path towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is simple, because our Plan de la Patria en Marcha and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development not only coincide, but they are also complementary instruments. In terms of their financing, everyone knows that over the past 18 years, 76 per cent of Venezuelaâ??s revenue has been dedicated to social investment, and that will continue to increase. No economic attack or illegal sanction will prevent President Maduro from continuing and developing policies that ensure the social rights of our fellow citizens. Yes, we are concerned about the obvious lack of sources of funding for both our brotherly countries and for those that last year expressed their willingness to comply with the 2030 Agenda although they lack the funds required to do so. The United Nations must commit to guaranteeing that worthy funding for the comprehensive and sustainable development of all Member States. It may be no coincidence that days before and during this seventy-second session of the General Assembly, the effects of the frequently warned of and feared climate change have manifested themselves through the devastation and death caused by consecutive hurricanes of magnitudes never previously seen. Those occurred not too far from New York. The unprecedented wrath of those natural phenomena has affected our brothers and sisters in several Caribbean countries. The Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, and of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, made two extraordinary statements to the General Assembly in which they bravely and emotionally expressed the most absolute truths and alerted us to the need for concrete, joint and urgent action to avoid greater havoc being wreaked by those phenomena, which are undeniably caused by climate change. Roosevelt Skerrit said that those small countries are becoming the victims of a war that they did not choose, did not start and are not part of. It is the war of developed countries and the capitalist system against our Mother Nature. Today, with greater emphasis than ever before, we recall the motto of environmental and conservationist social movements: let us not change the climate; let us change the system. Restoring physical infrastructure and using construction techniques that are resistant to the hardships of new natural phenomena cannot fall to the affected countries and people. It is also a shared and differentiated responsibility that must be borne principally by the countries that pollute the most and thereby contribute to climate change. In that context, and in the light of the consequences that we have witnessed, we find it extraordinary and hostile that the Government of the United States, the most polluting country, intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which, while not a panacea, is a collective step forward to mitigating the effects of climate change. How many hurricanes, typhoons, landslides, droughts and cases of subsidence; how many deaths, injured people and devastated countries are needed to ascertain that climate change, as stated by the experts of our very own United Nations, is a threat to the entire planet and that it is everyoneâ??s responsibility to reverse it? The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela offers its condolences to the Governments and families affected by the successive hurricanes in the Caribbean and the United States, as well as the victims of the terrible earthquakes in our sister nation, Mexico. While we have sought to deal immediately and in solidarity with the emergencies in our region, President Nicolas Maduro will continue to provide the necessary support, not only that which is at our disposal, but everything we can help coordinate and direct in order to assist our friends and brothers in Latin America and the Caribbean. As I said at the beginning of this statement, the Venezuelan people are subject to constant aggression by hegemonic Powers who seek to seize our natural resources â?? no more and no less than the worldâ??s largest oil reserve and one of the most important gas reserves, as well as our gold, diamond, coltan, iron, aluminium and thorium reserves and our biological diversity, water resources and fertile lands, among others. We have suffered multifaceted attacks against our economy, our currency and our production capacity. The attacks have included the induced generation of internal political violence by political factions that have tried to accede to power by undemocratic means since 2002. This year, we suffered four months of political violence, once again aimed at overthrowing President Maduro. After the tension and pain of the unjustifiable deaths, the opposition violence was neutralized and appeased by the great democratic and popular demonstration on 30 July, in which more than 8 million Venezuelans came out to vote for peace and to elect a civil, sovereign and plenipotentiary National Constituent Assembly. Those latest acts of violence by the Venezuelan extreme right took place on the very same 30 July in an effort to prevent people from going out to vote. Total political peace returned to the country from 31 July. We are witnesses to constituent peace. Our National Constituent Assembly, in coexistence with and respect for the rest of the constituted powers, has become not only a peacemaker and protector of the people, but also a quintessential instrument for national dialogue on and legitimate attention to the countryâ??s most urgent problems. We have an active and popular democracy. We in Venezuela have organized 22 elections in 18 years. The revolution has triumphed in 20 of those elections. We have always developed social dialogue as a method of deepening our democracy. That is why we also welcome the fact that the Venezuelan political opposition has decided to redirect itself along the democratic pathway and in line with the Constitution, through the participation of all its parties in the gubernatorial elections on 15 October. We celebrate the fact that President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic, former President Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, and former President Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic have adopted and defined the dialogue initiative that President Maduro announced just after the establishment of the National Constituent Assembly, and have summoned the parties to a process to which Nicaragua, Bolivia, Mexico and Chile have joined. We are grateful for the sincere support of those friendly countries and Governments, in order to promote the only possible solution â?? a peaceful, constitutional and sovereign solution that is built by all Venezuelans. In these times of turmoil in the world, we want to see a United Nations that is truly united. Any reform process must take place with the participation and inclusion of all its Members. We need a United Nations that is truly effective in neutralizing violent and unilateral initiatives, as we stated moments ago, and that is able to work together with all Member States, without hegemonic bias. We need a United Nations system that identifies and warns of the true causes of the greatest problems humankind suffers today, and attends to them with no distractions or pressures that may be costly, while always respecting the principles of our founding Charter of the United Nations. It is time for definitions. The historical struggle between healthy multilateralism and perverse unilateralism is at its peak. Let us make decisions that always bear in mind those who are most humble, the excluded, those who need us most, our Mother Nature. Let us be able to look into the eyes of our children and our grandchildren with the satisfaction of having halted the worst and guaranteed them a better future of peace, health and happiness. Let us build, through the United Nations, that which the Liberator asked of us in 1815 â?? a Government system that grants us the greatest possible amount of happiness, social security and political stability. From this house of multilateralism, we say, may multilateralism live. From this place of international law, may international law live; from this home of peace, may world peace live. From the heart of Venezuela, rely on the Bolivarian Government of President Nicolas Maduro to close ranks on justice, humanism and peace. As the Liberator wrote on 13 April 1823 to the then President of Peru, Jose de la Riva Agiiero, â??I am inclined to think that, when it is essential, love for the homeland will triumphâ??. Likewise, we hold the unwavering and unrelenting certainty that under any circumstances, love of our sovereign, peaceful and Bolivarian Venezuela, love of our working people, love of our good people and love of the homeland, will triumph. Peace will triumph and prevail. We will always triumph.",1,196
7889,Session 72 - 2017,VNM_72_2017.txt,VNM_72_2017,72,2017,VNM,"I extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. My special thanks also go to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. Only 10 months into his term of office, Mr. Guterres has already left his mark on the Organizationâ??s work for peace, development and human rights. On 20 September 1977, exactly 40 years ago, Viet Nam was admitted to the United Nations as its 149th Member. One day later, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Viet Nam stood right here at this rostrum and addressed the General Assembly (see A/32/PV.1). Representing a nation devastated by decades of war, he affirmed a unified Viet Namâ??s pledge to cooperate closely with other Member States in striving tirelessly to turn the lofty goals of the United Nations into reality. Those goals are peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. Those 40 years have been an era of transformation for my country. Today, Viet Nam is a dynamic economy on a path to reform and sustainable development. We have transformed ourselves from being aid-dependent to a lower middle-income country. Our efforts to implement the Millennium Development Goals have helped to bring millions of Vietnamese out of poverty. But one thing has not changed. Viet Nam today is as committed as ever to the United Nations. We are a staunch supporter and proponent of multilateralism with the United Nations at its core. We believe in the fundamental role of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of respect for sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity, non-interference, of refraining from the threat or use of force and of working for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We are gathered here as the world is undergoing profound and fast transformations. The fourth industrial revolution, particularly the advance of digital technology, is creating unprecedented opportunities for development for all. Enormous efforts to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are under way, and yet our world is still fraught with turmoil, uncertainties and fragility. While peace and cooperation prevail, people around the world are facing unprecedented challenges to their security and development. Political instability and the risk of conflicts, disasters and climate change threaten the sustainable development of all nations. Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction have gone global and are a threat to everyone. Efforts to achieve disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation have not progressed as expected. The worst migration and humanitarian crisis since the Second World War continues to unfold. For many decades, the desire to be able to live in peace has remained a distant dream for millions of people. Together, with the slow and unsustainable growth of the global economy, globalization and economic integration are now facing a less certain future. Inequality within and between countries remains one of the biggest challenges of our time. The impact of climate change is ever more real and far beyond what has been predicted. This year, we have witnessed multiple natural disasters that have inflicted heavy losses in human life and property in Cuba, Mexico, the United States and other Caribbean countries. Given those daunting challenges, the theme chosen for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ?? could not have been more timely. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the international community has clearly chosen sustainable development as the path towards a better destiny for current and future generations. It is now incumbent on us to make that ambitious plan a reality. Developing countries should be allowed more favourable conditions and resources to realize the Sustainable Development Goals. We call on developed nations to fulfil their commitments on providing financial assistance and technology transfer for developing countries. On the path to sustainable development, we must place the interests of the people at the centre of all our policies and actions. If we do not, we will not be able to ensure a decent life for all. I do not believe that life can be decent when poverty, unemployment and epidemics are still not effectively addressed. It cannot be decent if it is still threatened by climate change and disasters. Above all, we will not succeed in our quest for sustainable development and a decent life for all if we cannot secure sustainable peace. Having enjoyed peace and independence for the past four decades, we now know what peace can bring about. Sustaining peace must always be at the top of our agenda. That major undertaking will take strong commitment and cooperation. I believe we will need to come together to strengthen multilateralism to achieve those goals. For todayâ??s global challenges, multilateralism has been shown to provide the most effective solutions. Multilateral institutions are venues in which countries can align their various interests, manage disputes and differences, and promote cooperation. However, trust in multilateralism will falter if those institutions fail to prove their effectiveness or lack consensus on common goals and principles. Global and regional multilateral mechanisms should therefore function in a transparent, effective and responsive manner. The United Nations must be at the centre of coordination and joint efforts to address global challenges, building an ever more comprehensive system of rules and norms with a mechanism for ensuring objectiveness, fairness and equality. To do that, the United Nations must undertake comprehensive reforms, from its organizational structure and working methodologies to the way that development resources are mobilized and allocated. Viet Nam supports efforts to reform the United Nations in that regard and will participate responsibly in the process. International law is an essential foundation of order and stability in international relations. Wars, conflicts and tension occur today mainly because international law is not fully respected or observed in good faith. We believe that by upholding international law, peace can be secured. We should take concrete action, in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, to prevent conflicts, build confidence and peacefully settle disputes, including in the Middle East and Africa, and we call for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In that regard, we also find that the unilateral embargo on Cuba is inappropriate and call for its immediate removal. We welcome the recent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a historic milestone on the road to a world free of nuclear weapons. I am signing the Treaty today, and call on others to sign and ratify it so as to enable its entry into force as soon as possible. Let us all be clear â?? the danger of nuclear weapons will loom over humankind as long as they continue to exist. This year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Viet Nam is proud to be a member. ASEAN is striving to build a rules-based and people-oriented community to strengthen its centrality in the evolving regional architecture and actively contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Viet Nam is working closely with other ASEAN members to address common challenges. With regard to the South China Sea dispute, Viet Nam and ASEAN call on all the parties concerned to exercise self-restraint and settle disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. They must fully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the completion of an effective and legally binding code of conduct. Viet Nam also took pride in hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum this year, as we seek to build an Asia-Pacific partnership for sustainable and inclusive development in the twenty-first century. At the global level, Viet Nam has actively engaged in the work of the United Nations, serving on the Human Rights Council from 2014 to 2016 and as a member of the Economic and Social Council for the term 2016-2018. We have begun to implement our national plan of action for implementing the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We will present our voluntary national review on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in 2018. In March, Viet Nam hosted a high-level Euro-Asia regional meeting on improving cooperation on transit and trade facilitation. Since 2014, Viet Nam has sent its officers to work in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa and is preparing for the deployment of level-two field hospitals. Before that, in 2009, Viet Nam presented its candidature for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2020-2021. We believe that those are the most practical ways we can contribute to the cause of sustainable peace and security. I am confident that through our concerted effort and the strength of multilateralism, we will fulfil our mission to maintain peace and security and secure a decent life and a sustainable future for all.",1,196
7890,Session 72 - 2017,VUT_72_2017.txt,VUT_72_2017,72,2017,VUT,"It is a great honour for me to make this statement on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Vanuatu. I join other speakers in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- second session. As an elected Vice-President of this organ, Vanuatu is pleased to work closely with you, Sir, as you guide us through this session. Please be assured that you have the full support of my delegation. I would also like to commend His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his vision, leadership and dedication during his tenure as President of the Assembly during the seventy-first session. Allow me also to express my profound gratitude to the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, for his notable leadership to this day. On behalf of my people, the people of Vanuatu, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims of the earthquake in Mexico, to the victims of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, which devastated the Caribbean, and to the victims of Hurricane Harvey, which ravaged Texas. My delegation welcomes the theme of the seventy- second session of the General Assembly, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. This is a timely and necessary theme. It is timely because, when we look around, we see a world plunged in endless political conflicts and turmoil. We are witnessing an escalation of extremism and violence caused by racism, xenophobia, hostility and intolerance. The theme is also necessary because we must remember that the human being and a sustainable future are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Today, 72 years after the creation of the United Nations, doubts continue to weigh on us. When will all nations, rich and poor, and people of all races, learn to live together in peace, embracing diversity and practicing tolerance? We must ask ourselves when conflicts and wars will become scourges of the past. At one time or another in the last 72 years, we have failed in our duty to be a United Nations endeavouring to achieve the economic and social advancement of all our peoples and to join forces to promote peace and security in the world. The world continues to face economic and political challenges, and the world economy remains confined to a prolonged period of slow growth, with a global gross product estimated to grow by some 2.7 per cent in 2017. This is only an economic stabilization and does not respond to growth in world demand. The rise of terrorism, violent extremism, asymmetric wars and political instability in the world have reached an unprecedented level in 2017 and will continue to weigh on the economic prospects of many regions. Vanuatu continues to be seriously concerned about the large movements of refugees and migrants, many of whom are fleeing violent conflict, disasters and poverty. In 2016, some 65 million people were forcibly displaced around the world. The rural exodus to the city and a relatively high rate of urbanization also present the same challenges at the national level. Vanuatu notes with deep concern the irrefutable link between the global crisis and the failure to respect the principles of the responsibility to protect and the prevention of mass atrocity crimes in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and South Sudan, to cite only a few. As a small island State exposed to the rising sea level that will overwhelm its islands and force its people to seek refuge, I would like to appeal to the international community to mobilize its efforts and to begin the debate on the establishment of an international legal framework that will truly solve the problem of climate-change refugees from small island States. As a small island State in the Pacific, Vanuatu is a strong supporter of a rules-based international regime through which States act fairly and transparently with each other, and through which economic development could come to fruition and where peace and security in the world could be maintained. That is why Vanuatu has faith in the United Nations. The United Nations remains for Vanuatu the best hope and catalyst for regional and global peace and security. I would like to highlight the valuable and potential work that this body has done to lift millions out of poverty, promote and protect human rights, and bring about an international order seen in much of the world today. However, to remain relevant, there is a need for strategic reforms. Being a permanent member of the Security Council is more a responsibility than a privilege. It is therefore incumbent on the Council to disregard the political interests of both sides and to seek compromise solutions. It is essential to ensure that the Security Council meets the objectives, principles and promises of the Charter of the United Nations. We support the reforms of the Security Council that reflect current geopolitical dynamics and provide for a more equitable regional representation as well as a continuous reform of the United Nations peacekeeping operations to better prevent and resolve complex conflicts in our contemporary world and to better protect civilians. My Government welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on repositioning the United Nations development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. I am particularly encouraged by the fact that the report highlights the need to have more robust coordination and accountability procedures within the United Nations system and realign it to better respond to countriesâ?? efforts to implement the transformative 2030 Agenda. Earlier this year, we launched our national sustainable development plan to 2030, also known as the Peopleâ??s Plan, which encompasses sustainable development goals. We know that the way ahead to implement this national road map will be tough, given structural weaknesses, extreme weather events, frequent earthquakes and external economic shocks. Vanuatu has ranked as one of the most disaster-prone countries for four years in a row. To make the path even more difficult, the General Assembly has planned to remove Vanuatuâ??s status as a least developed country (LDC) in December 2020. Unfortunately, the fact that we have developed and emerged from LDC status does not mean that we have eliminated our vulnerabilities and structural barriers. My Government calls on the United Nations to ensure that the change in the status of a country like ours does not cause disruption or hamper our development. The measures in place to support the change in LDC status are simply insufficient given the challenges that these countries will face. The transition mechanisms after such a change must be further strengthened. Vanuatu calls on the United Nations to continue to recognize Vanuatu as an LDC, rather than completely eliminating the specific support for it as an LDC. We also call on development partners and aid agencies to consider gradually reducing LDC development assistance. There should be clear provisions for reducing trade benefits to LDCs, stipulated in bilateral agreements and by the World Trade Organization. My Government is also concerned about threats to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. The provocative missile programme of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea violates several Security Council resolutions and poses an unprecedented threat to security in the region and around the world. Vanuatu condemns in the strongest terms the most recent round of missile launches and joins with the international community in encouraging the Administration of the Democratic Peopleâ??s Republic of Korea to end its nuclear and missile development programme. We also call on the United Nations to find common ground with the Republic and to engage in dialogue for a peaceful solution. My Government reaffirms its commitment to the denuclearization of the Pacific and welcomes the Treaty adopted at the conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument banning nuclear weapons. Vanuatu reaffirms its commitment to complete nuclear disarmament. The report on regionalism recently published by the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat provides a geopolitical assessment of the trends, threats and opportunities for regional development and political aspirations. It includes strategies that Forum members can use to build a stronger, more resilient and responsive Pacific region. We in the Pacific know how important it is to work in unison, because it is through unity that we are stronger and can achieve positive results. Similarly, the actions of the United Nations are more decisive when members are united. Our understanding of the science of climate change has deepened over the past few years, and its devastating impact knows no borders. The terrible earthquake in Mexico, Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, Hurricane Harvey in Texas and tropical storm Pam, which devastated Vanuatu in 2015, are brutal warnings from Mother Nature that the climate is changing faster than our efforts to counter that change. Solving a problem that has taken centuries to manifest itself requires more reflection and effort on our part. By collectively reducing the rate at which we emit greenhouse gases, we can make a major difference. We can limit the average rise in temperature to less than 1.5Â°C, change the chemistry of the oceans, manage sea- level rise and prevent disasters for generations to come. We urge all States Members of the United Nations to persevere. We therefore urge the United States, as part of the one world we have, to reverse its decision and enforce the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. My country is deeply concerned about climate change and the Paris Agreement, and we are committed to reversing the decline in the health of our oceans. The United Nations Ocean Conference, held here in New York in June, has shown that the quality of the oceans, which contribute to our livelihoods, has been seriously undermined and that urgent and immediate attention on our part is required, now more than ever before. We are from an island nation surrounded by a vast ocean and know how important it is. We are very concerned about the health of the ocean because it has an impact on humankindâ??s survival. My Government is committed to implementing the resolutions of the Conference, including Sustainable Development Goal 14, by 2030, through partnerships and national efforts. We are committed to achieving our national goal of 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, with the support of our development partners. We have launched our national oceans policy, but we will also ban the use of plastic bags by 2018 in order to reduce the amount of ocean debris and preserve its health. At the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting in Apia, I called on the leaders and peoples of the Pacific island countries to join Vanuatu in this struggle and to be more responsible in preserving our blue Pacific Ocean in order to guarantee human survival. My Government remains fully committed to achieving its national sustainable development plan. We have begun to meet the challenge of turning our goals into tangible action. My Government pledges to submit Vanuatuâ??s voluntary report in mid-2018. We hope to share our progress and our failures in meeting our sustainable development goals, while fully respecting the continuity of the partnership for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Vanuatu is convinced that in order to end poverty, opportunities for all people, in particular women, must be made available. Greater access must be given to education, nutrition and health. My Government is committed to eliminating the barriers that disproportionately affect our vulnerable groups. We successfully launched our national policies on gender equality and the protection of children in November 2016. Both policies take into account violence and discrimination against women and girls, as well as the neglect, exploitation and abuse of and violence against children. We are also aware that a balanced and equitable distribution of the necessary resources and infrastructure in our provinces will help to develop the provinces and reduce poverty. My Government is committed to ensuring a peaceful, just and inclusive society and to building responsive institutions capable of delivering quality services to our citizens. We work with our development partners to enhance the resilience and adaptability of our peoples to climate change and natural disasters. My Government is committed to structural reform to ensure political and economic stability, based on equitable and sustainable growth that would create jobs and increase our citizensâ?? incomes. My Government sincerely thanks our traditional development partners for their contribution to the economic development of our country. We are ready to forge new partnerships to further stimulate our productive and infrastructure sectors. My Government is concerned about the fact that the United Nations has lost much of its ability and willingness to implement Security Council resolution 1514 (1960), of 14 December 1960, which called for an swift and unconditional end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. Decolonization must return to the agenda of the United Nations, and all efforts must be free of the pressures of international politics. We all have a collective responsibility to guarantee the self- determination of peoples under the colonial yoke. We firmly believe that territorial disputes should be resolved peacefully, while respecting cultural heritage and adhering to United Nations conventions and to the provisions of international law of the sea. In that regard, I should like to point out that there have been recent incursions into disputed areas of Vanuatu, which is not in keeping with United Nations principles or the provisions of international law of the sea. For half a century, the international community has witnessed several instances of torture, murder, exploitation, sexual violence and arbitrary arrest that the people of West Papua have suffered at the hands of the Indonesians, and it has ignored their voices and calls for help. We urge the Human Rights Council to investigate those abuses. We also call on our leading partners around the world to support the legal right to self-determination of West Papua. We call on them, along with Indonesia, to end all forms of violence and find common ground with the citizens of West Papua in order to facilitate a process that will enable them to freely express their will. I return to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations to reaffirm the belief in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights of men and women, and of nations, great and small. I believe that we all have an obligation to work together to lift the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba. Removing those restrictions will, inter alia, enable the Cuban people to enjoy their human rights. New Caledonia is in the critical phase of deciding its future, as the 2018 referendum is quickly approaching. We thank all countries, in particular France, that have supported the process thus far. We urge the administering Power to ensure that the referendum is fair and transparent and that the wishes of the people are honoured. We also call on France to facilitate a fair and transparent process of self-determination for French Polynesia. In conclusion, as we begin the seventy-second session of the General Assembly, let us work together with a specific goal in mind: to respond judiciously to the many challenges we face for the common good of humankind. May God bless the States Members of the United Nations.",1,196
7891,Session 72 - 2017,WSM_72_2017.txt,WSM_72_2017,72,2017,WSM,"Samoa warmly welcomes the assumption of Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, at a time when our Organization is going through unprecedentedly volatile and difficult times. We look forward to his leadership so that together we can chart a safer, more predictable and more humane pathway in our journey through lifeâ??s uncharted waters. He can count on Samoaâ??s support as we work in partnership to translate into tangible and measurable achievements the overarching theme of his tenure, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. The Presidentâ??s predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, demonstrated strong leadership during his successful presidency. We wish him well in his new calling. Secretary-General Guterres is passionate about, and committed to, turning the United Nations into an efficient and effective Organization that is fit for purpose and readily responsive to the needs of the very peoples it was established to serve in the first place. In working to make the focus of the United Nations more people-centred than process-centred, Samoa assures the Secretary-General of its full support. This weekâ??s annual general debate is the twentieth successive general debate of the General Assembly that I have attended and addressed. My continuous participation is a measure of my conviction and my Governmentâ??s unqualified faith in the value of the United Nations and the endless potential that it holds to deal successfully with any issue of diversity and gravity that it confronts. The United Nations remains our choice of last resort and hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to address our challenges. That is why we want it to remain relevant and adaptable to changing circumstances. It must be able to respond effectively to the current and emerging challenges that our world faces. We meet against the backdrop of a world plagued by uncertainty and a sense of ebbing hope. We are losing the fight to free our world from poverty and instability. Conflicts abound, and we are no longer distanced or disconnected from deadly acts of terrorism and the devastation of natural and human-induced disasters. We are living in an environment of risk. Climate change is an existential threat. Allow me to pause and offer our sincere condolences to the Governments and the peoples of all the countries that have suffered from the recent devastation of hurricanes and earthquakes. We cannot help but watch with trepidation and uneasiness the global dynamics that are nudging our world perilously close to a potential catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. As small island Pacific countries, we are no longer protected by our isolation. We are bystanders, but we have the most to lose in the unfolding power drama being played out on the Korean peninsula. We pray for visionary leadership with sound moral judgment on both sides in order to ensure that we give peace a chance. That explains why I signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons yesterday on Samoaâ??s behalf. As a signatory to that historic Treaty, we wanted to demonstrate unequivocally our aspiration for a world without nuclear weapons. The conventional narrative that the possession of nuclear weapons will act as deterrent to make the world a safer place to live has not been borne out by the current realities. Otherwise, the developments on the Korean peninsula would not have happened at all. We firmly believe that possessing nuclear weapons and adding new nuclear Powers only make our world less safe, less secure and less peaceful, hence the need to rid our world completely of all nuclear weapons. No matter how noble a goal lies behind having such arsenals, allowing them to fall into the wrong and unprincipled hands is a recipe for doom and mayhem, because people, after all, are human and mere mortals. But all is not yet lost. The adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which offers a united approach to addressing the plight of the worldâ??s displaced peoples, the creation of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, which is aimed at enhancing the Organizationâ??s capability to assist Member States in implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and the historic, first-ever Treaty banning nuclear weapons are all positive developments moving forward. Like other global challenges, climate change transcends borders without leaving a trace. It has no respect for sovereignty and does not discriminate between rich and poor countries. Its dire consequences are real, including for those who remain in denial. Climate change is a perpetual priority issue for my country and our Pacific region. In our small islands, as we witnessed recently, natural catastrophes can decimate an entire country, bringing with them great pain and upheaval to peoplesâ?? lives, as well as set back the national economy for years. We know that from repeated past experience. Our islandsâ?? limited resources and lack of adaptive capacity make the burden of rehabilitation a mammoth undertaking. While we applaud the resilience of our people to bounce back from major natural disasters, the scars of those natural phenomena take years to heal and recover from. If it is any consolation to our island States, even some of the well-resourced developed countries continue to try to recover from and overcome the impact of catastrophes that devastated their economies. Samoa remains committed to ongoing efforts to pursue respect for human rights and the rule of law, and does its part to contribute to that global effort. For the first time ever, at Samoaâ??s invitation, a United Nations human rights expert group visited last month to carry out a fact-finding mission to assess the progress made towards eliminating discrimination against women and towards protecting and promoting womenâ??s rights in the country. Samoa is the first Pacific country to open its doors to that independent mechanism. We continue to place great faith in the rule of law and the vital protection it offers to all States, especially to weak and small countries like mine without any armed forces or affiliation to any military grouping. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is an important part of the architecture of world peace based on the rule of law. We call for the early activation of the Kampala Amendments. The ICC was represented at the Pacific Islands Forum Special Leadersâ?? Retreat held earlier this month in Samoa. Terrorism is an offence to humankind and runs contrary to the core values of the United Nations. For Samoa, I reaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism, which send a clear signal of our determination to suppress terrorist activities, including training, international recruiting and financing. Samoa continues to align its domestic policies and legislation to meeting its international obligations to help combat terrorism, as well as to participate actively in Pacific regional security initiatives. In the context of peacekeeping, Samoaâ??s unwavering support for United Nations peacekeeping work is underscored by 17 years of uninterrupted police deployment serving in missions in Liberia, the Sudan, Timor-Leste and South Sudan. Although we are a small country, Samoan police officers continue to serve side by side with officers from other countries in places that require the intervention of the United Nations. Our commitment is rooted in our firm belief in the role that United Nations peacekeeping plays in helping eliminate the causes of conflict and in bringing about peace and stability. We fully endorse the condemnation of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping, which is why we signed the international compact initiative of the Secretary-General to committing countries to eliminating those heinous acts in peacekeeping. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides our framework to put the world on a path towards a sustainable and resilient future for the people, the planet and prosperity. Although the 2030 Agenda remains a high priority on the global agenda and we see signs of momentum in terms of its implementation, much work remains to be done. The need to accelerate global action on, and awareness of, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains. The adoption of the Pacific regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific complements Samoaâ??s road map based on an integrated approach involving the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the Samoa Pathway, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, which are aligned with our national development strategy. For small island developing States, the Samoa Pathway is their sustainable development road map, which highlights their key tasks and priorities, and is closely linked to the 2030 Agenda. As we approach the five-year review of the Samoa Pathway in 2019, it is important to ensure that the comprehensive review of United Nations support for SIDS is properly addressed and implemented. We need to study closely lessons learned from the partnerships registered for SIDS and encourage proactive follow-up, as well as pursue new partnerships for the groupâ??s sustainable development. Since the last annual global multi-stakeholder small island developing States partnership dialogue, several partnerships and voluntary commitments specific to small island developing States were launched during the Ocean Conference. Prior to the mid-term review of the SIDS outcome document, it is important that we look at ways of improving implementation and addressing gaps and emerging issues. The success of the Ocean Conference was crucial to building momentum in the implementation of the SDGs, given that the ocean is the lifeblood of the planet. Addressing the targets of SDG 14 for SIDS is catalytic to implementing several, if not all, of the 17 Goals. With the new Blue Pacific concept for the Pacific region, and the concrete outcomes from the Conference, emphasis will be placed on implementation. At the Ocean Conference, Samoa pledged 13 voluntary commitments that showcased national efforts aimed at the conservation, management and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources and the engagement of communities. During the Ocean Conference in June, I was appointed the Special Ambassador of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. The year 2017 is a crucial one for sustainable tourism. Given the reliance of many of our small economies on tourism and the role it can play in SDG implementation, we will continue to promote the role of tourism in support of peaceful societies and sustainable development. Let me now turn to the regional context and share with the Assembly some of the decisions taken by the leaders of our Pacific Islands Forum at their forty- eighth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, which my country was privileged to host at the beginning of the month. For our year-long chairmanship we chose the theme â??The Blue Pacific: Our sea of islands â?? Our security through sustainable development, management and conservationâ??. We in Samoa reaffirmed the Framework for Pacific Regionalism to drive our regionâ??s policy agenda towards the realization of our vision, that of a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity, so as to enable all Pacific people to lead free, healthy and productive lives. We also endorsed the Blue Pacific identity as the core driver of collective action for advancing the leadersâ?? vision under the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. This new narrative calls for inspired leadership and a long-term Pacific Islands Forum foreign policy commitment to act as one for the good of all rather than a few. The Blue Pacific identity reinforces the potential of our shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean, based on the explicit recognition of our shared ocean identity, ocean geography and ocean resources. It aims to strengthen collective action by putting the Blue Pacific at the centre of regional policymaking and united action for advancing the Pacific Islands Forum Leadersâ?? vision for the region. We discussed the key priorities for our region with other Pacific leaders, a few of which I will highlight, as their implementation requires collective and urgent action from this gathering of the United Nations. First, climate change remains a priority challenge for the Pacific region because of its existential nature and its security implications. Climate change is already happening; it cannot be washed away by the rising tides. It has significant security implications. Its impact threatens the continued existence and viability as sovereign States of some of our low-lying atolls. Even countries that have been in self-denial with regard to the phenomenon of climate change, must surely now accept the weight of scientific evidence. The implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is of high priority and requires collective action to address this existential threat. We are confident that Fijiâ??s presidency of the twenty- third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will focus the spotlight on challenges and the need for genuine partnerships to help us deliver on our nationally determined contributions as part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Pacific has also endorsed its Framework for Resilience Development in the Pacific: An Integrated Approach to Address Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management and its institutional arrangements to support the elaboration and implementation of the Paris Agreement. Secondly, the ocean and its resources continue to be critical to the livelihoods of our people and the region. The impacts of climate change, illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and overfishing are threatening the sustainability of this crucial resource of our region. The Pacific Forum members will continue to be actively engaged on all ocean-related issues at the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, including the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction process. Thirdly, we adopted the Pacific Road Map for Sustainable Development and its implementation strategy. That reflects the seriousness our region places on implementing the 17 SDGs and the importance of a regional approach to meeting those international commitments. We continue to count on the important role of the United Nations and our partners to support regional and national efforts for SDG implementation, particularly the building of our capabilities. We look forward to the Secretary-Generalâ??s reform and how the Forum can engage to ensure its priorities in terms of its SDG road map and the implementation of the Samoa Pathway, the Paris Agreement and other regional needs are considered in the reform. Finally, in the context of security, the Pacific Islands Forum remains committed to collective arrangements and mechanisms to assist regional Governments recover from national conflicts and crises. The success of thse arrangements, together with the support of the United Nations, is already evident in the positive results of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). I am honoured to acknowledge the successful conclusion of the Mission, which brought together peacekeepers from all member countries of the Pacific Islands Forum. Leaders acknowledged the successful conclusion of RAMSI and recognized it as a success story of regionalism and a workable example of regional cooperation and diplomacy, embodying more than a decade of partnership and cooperation among the Forum member countries. They agreed to build on the Biketawa Declaration and other Forum security-related declarations to expand the concept of security, including human security, humanitarian assistance, prioritizing environmental security and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate change. Over the years, the Pacific has continued to call for advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation. Issues such as radioactive contaminants in the Republic of the Marshall Islands are of great concern to both that country and the region. We count on the promised support of the relevant United Nations entities to respond accordingly to requests for assistance, including working closely with the regional technical agencies. The United States of America is also encouraged to take urgent action to address the issue.",1,196
7892,Session 72 - 2017,YEM_72_2017.txt,YEM_72_2017,72,2017,YEM,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Yemen, I sincerely congratulate the President and his friendly nation, Slovakia, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, and wish him every success in his endeavours. I would also like to express my great appreciation for the significant efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, in guiding the work of the previous session. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his exceptional efforts in implementing the Organizationâ??s noble mission of maintaining international peace and security, and in employing all its good offices with a view to achieving sustainable peace in my country, Yemen. We are also grateful to his Special Envoy for Yemen, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. This debate is being held as we in the Republic of Yemen are ending our third year of the war imposed on our people by the Houthi/Saleh coalition, following its rebellion against the consensus solutions adopted under the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism and the outcomes of the national dialogue, as well as the political process carried out fully under the auspices of the United Nations. The political process culminated in a visit to Sanaâ??a by the former Secretary-General, where he held a special meeting with the Security Council in Yemen. The evil Houthi/Saleh coalition has rebelled against the national consensus, which was based on the outcomes of the national dialogue and included all the Yemeni political parties and social factions. It has used violence and terrorism to rebel against the legitimately elected leadership and armed force against our people. It has destroyed the cities of Yemen and taken the entire country hostage. After exhausting every possible peaceful political means to turn this evil coalition away from the path of violence and terrorism that it has chosen, the Yemeni people, in all their various factions, have united and resisted the rebelsâ?? de facto policy of facilitating Iranian expansionism in our region. To that end, we have requested support, on behalf of the people of Yemen, from our brothers in the Arab coalition under the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have responded to our request and granted us support. The theme of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly represents what we have been seeking in Yemen. Through negotiations in Geneva, Vienna and Kuwait, our legitimate leadership has sought a sustainable, fair and lasting peace that will not falter and that lays the foundation for a real State that ensures peace and security for all its citizens and prevents violence. We seek a peace that grants the State alone a monopoly on the use of force and prevents armed militias from forming and operating in the country. It must be a peace that is based on consensual documents that people have agreed on and that have received international and regional support. Here, I would like to clarify a commonly heard claim that our problem in Yemen is one of political differences that cannot be managed merely by sitting around negotiation tables, despite our efforts and compromises in that regard. But what we are facing is not even a coup dâ??Ã©tat as it is commonly understood. It transcends that and is based on a difference in philosophies, ideologies and values. We are dealing with extremist religious sects that believe that God has granted them an ethnic superiority and the right to rule, to forge alliances with forces that seek retaliation and that go against all human values. In this way, the coup of the Houthis, who are racist, backward and patrilineal, has gone beyond any traditional military coups dâ??Ã©tat, which still preserve the State and its institutions. These militias are destroying all State institutions. The army and security forces have been replaced by popular committees and militias that serve one faction only, based on ethnicity. That also affects economic institutions. Our resources are utterly depleted, and we have not even been able to pay salaries for almost a year. The private sector has disappeared, replaced by a new class of merchants who function at the expense of our national interests. Even our school curricula have been replaced with extremist curricula that have provoked sectarian strife. On top of all that, the opposition militias receive full support, politically and militarily, in kind, in the form of weapons and financing from Iran, a State that is determined to destabilize our region. Sustained peace can therefore only be possible if Iran ceases to interfere in our affairs, which it has been doing by creating tensions, inventing conflicts and stoking feelings of hatred and violence. We must control Iranâ??s expansionist aspirations in the region. Member States may remember that when I stood before the Assembly five years ago, I spoke of the measures that we would take on the path of peaceful political transition in Yemen in the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and the National Dialogue Conference outcomes, and I informed them that Iran had been taking various measures against us. We have seized shipments carrying arms, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have been supporting the militias in our country and supplying them with long-range missiles. They remain a threat to our country and the entire world. I am trying to give Member States an image of the events from the inside. The world needs to understand that the rebels are refusing all calls for peace â?? from Kuwait to Geneva â?? including the latest initiative about the port of Al Hudaydah. We announced that we were ready to accept the initiative on the Hudaydah seaport, but the other side has unilaterally rejected it. They even attempted to assassinate an international envoy. They have continued to threaten international peace and security and international maritime sea lanes. They have also threatened our brothers in the United Arab Emirates, attacking them with rockets. 17-29579 25/26 From this rostrum, I emphasize our continued willingness to stop the war and build peace. We are not warmongers. We desire peace. And I have personally extended my hand, and will continue to do so, to reach a sustainable peace, because we feel the weight of our responsibility for all citizens of the Yemeni State. I affirm that we continue to desire peace based on the consensus agreements and everything that the international community has endorsed, including the implementation of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). I must not forget here to thank our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who have led the efforts to mitigate our humanitarian crisis through the support that their country continues to provide through the King Salman Centre for Humanitarian Aid and Relief, and to thank all of the humanitarian organizations of the Arab coalition, donor countries and the United Nations agencies, as well as all the international efforts to combat the cholera outbreak. We stress that we are still in need of support and assistance, given our high levels of poverty, insecurity and food insecurity. We are still under blockade and at war. The city of Taiz has been under siege for three years. The situation is dire in all of the governorates under rebel control. Salaries are no longer being paid. The Stateâ??s resources, including customs incomes, have been looted. We therefore call on the United Nations and the international community to shoulder their responsibilities in Yemen by applying pressure on the rebels to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and offer real compromises, so that we can avoid more bloodshed and destruction and so that humanitarian assistance can reach the people who need it. From this rostrum, I announce that we in the Yemeni Government are ready to provide all of the facilitation needed so that humanitarian assistance can have access everywhere in Yemen, from Sanaâ??a to Al-Mahra, as well as in the areas under Houthi control. We are responsible before God first and before our people and the world as well. We are responsible for all our Yemeni people, regardless of their loyalties. We want to preserve the life of every Yemeni, including those who fire bullets at us and target the Yemeni people. As a legitimately elected leader, it is my job to save the Yemeni people from further bloodshed. It is forbidden for a Yemeni to kill another â?? absolutely forbidden. The Yemeni Government continues to face the economic and security challenges that stem from the destruction of all aspects of Yemeni life. Today, the Yemeni Government needs extensive support for its efforts to consolidate peace and stability, provide services in the liberated areas, control the economic situation and implement counter-terrorism measures. We call on friendly donor countries and international organizations to provide urgent support to Yemen and uphold the pledges made at the conference held in Geneva in April in support of the humanitarian response plan for Yemen. One year has passed, and only 50 per cent of the pledged funding has been provided. We also want to reactivate the dormant Group of Friends of Yemen. We must save Yemen from the crisis and move from humanitarian relief to reconstruction and economic recovery. The Republic of Yemen sincerely and effectively supports counter-terrorism efforts, particularly because my country has long suffered from terrorism. We reject all forms of terrorism and continue to embrace our tolerant Islamic values, which reject violence and extremism, while calling for tolerance and brotherly relations. We reach out to the international community to coordinate efforts in the areas of security, culture and information and technology, so that we can defeat terrorism together. Israelâ??s occupation of the Palestinian territories and its settlement policies still represent one of the greatest causes of stress in our region. The people of our region therefore look to the Assembly to find a fair and lasting solution so that the Palestinian people can establish their own State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and end the occupation and settlement, as well as the suffering of the Palestinian people. The Republic of Yemen denounces the plight of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. That genocide must cease. Terrorism in the State must stop, and we call on the international community to uphold its responsibilities and prevent such monstrous events, which we thought our modern world had permanently eliminated. Together with our patient people and all the honourable citizens of the world, we will spare no effort to rid the Yemeni people of the atrocities committed by the rebels. We will, with Godâ??s help, fulfil the aspirations of our people to build a federal civil State that upholds justice and equality and good governance. We will rebuild a new Yemen that embraces all of its children â?? a Yemen that is a source of stability and security for itself, its neighbours and the world. I should not conclude without expressing my sincere congratulations to all Yemeni people and freedom-loving nations on the occasion of the fifty- fifth anniversary of our revolution, on 26 September, which we will commemorate in the next few days. That revolution uprooted one of the most despotic regimes in histor, that of Imam Ahmed in northern Yemen, whom liberators toppled to found our Republic in 1963. We are reminded of that racist regime by the Houthis and their allies. Over the past three years, they have tried to impose a similarly racist regime once again, in an even more violent and terroristic manner. During the time that our capital of Sanaâ??a has been under Houthi control, thousands have been killed, injured or detained. The media have been outlawed and journalists arrested, along with countless other retaliatory measures. We must control that racist group. I salute our people on the occasion of the revolutionâ??s anniversary. In conclusion, I wish the General Assembly every success at its seventy-second session and hope that it can achieve more development and effectiveness in its work. And I wish all Member States and human society prosperity, peace and stability.",1,196
7893,Session 72 - 2017,YUG_72_2017.txt,YUG_72_2017,72,2017,YUG,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming your important duties. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his successful presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session and to avail myself of this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to the new Secretary-General, Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres, for his active engagement during the first year of his tenure in such a remarkably responsible post and for initiating a reform process of great importance to the Organization. It is my great honour to address the Assembly for the first time in this Hall in my capacity as President of the Republic of Serbia. We have carefully followed the addresses made by world leaders over the past two days, and it seems that it would be no exaggeration to say that almost everybody has spoken about the necessity of the reform of the United Nations and about peace and stability, often accusing someone else â?? an opposing party â?? of acting to prevent peace and stability or being responsible for a difficult situation in the world. I will do my best to avoid such an approach. Last year, in this very Hall, it was said that the situation worldwide was difficult. Today it is certainly more difficult than it was a year ago. Today, I take this opportunity to speak before the Assembly, not to attack those who cannot defend themselves or those who would not be able to defend themselves from the truth. I will speak about Serbia, its people, its re-entering of the world, and the fact that the world is once again accepting and embracing Serbia and Serbia is trying to understand the world, even if sometimes it might not agree with the great Powers. Unlike some leaders, I have no need to patronize my people or to run an election or non-election campaign from this rostrum, because we have already won all our internal political battles. That is why I will speak about Serbia today and Serbia in the future, as well as the future of the entire Western Balkans region, where I come from. It important to speak about the entire Balkans, especially its Western part, because without broader and more serious insight into the problem we are facing, we will not be able to see, let alone resolve, our individual problems. I would like to share a quote from our famous writer, Isidora SekuliÄ?, who said the following: â??A peninsula is a separate world. Countries and nations within it, as if embarked on one boat, must have one common political problem and a political ideal, no matter how different they might usually be. The Balkans comes first, before all the countries in the Balkans, whenever the moment is difficult and dangerous, regardless of whether it is dangerous politically or in terms of culture. Will the Balkans for once open its sleepy eyes and see its paramount cultural capacity, if it plunges as a whole?â?? Condition number one for a prosperous future for all of us in that region is how to preserve peace and tranquillity. The Republic of Serbia invests a great deal of effort in stabilizing the situation in the region, which is our permanent commitment and policy. As we have done so far, we will continue to work devotedly and committedly to promote regional stability and cooperation, because we believe that it is an investment in a better tomorrow for all of us. In order to achieve success today and progress in the future, it is necessary, no matter how pathetic that might seem, to preserve peace and stability at all costs. This is a priority sociopolitical task that requires daily hard work and learning. That in turn will help economic growth and reforms, which are a prerequisite for a better life, not only for the poor but also for the middle classes. In previous years, we in Serbia demonstrated that with responsible politics of fiscal consolidation, even without huge privatization incomes, we could create a budget surplus. We lowered the unemployment rate from 26 per cent to 12 per cent and created a flexible labour market by introducing modern laws, even though doing that has proved difficult for some far stronger countries in the developed West. Above all else, I am proud that we have begun to invest in the creativity of our young people and that digitalization and artificial intelligence are becoming important topics in Serbia, not just in the most developed countries of the world. Of course, there are still many things that we must deliver. When a person comes from the Western Balkans the first question is whether we will be part of some new conflict or whether we will opt for a better and more carefree future. In spite of its numerous challenges, Serbia will continue investing in efforts to create conditions for better relations within the region that are based on mutual respect and commitment to a common European future. Today I would particularly like to mention the political issues in the region and Belgradeâ??s relations with Pristina. Bearing in mind the paramount 2/26 17-29579 importance of this issue for the Republic of Serbia, I underline once again that reaching a political solution to the issue of Kosovo and Metohija is a national priority for Serbia. It is an issue that has a huge effect not only on our economy but also on a clear future for young people both in Serbia and in the entire region. We all know that we do not recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of so-called Kosovo, but I will not speak about disrespect for our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Instead, I will speak about our efforts to resolve the problem and to try to find a solution to a centuries-long problem that the great Powers were not helpful with back in 1999 and 2008. I will speak about our efforts to talk about the future with Albanian leaders from Pristina. Yesterday we all listened to Michael Bloomberg saying that it is better to spend thousands of hours talking than one minute fighting. Everything that has been achieved so far through the Brussels dialogue has been the result of difficult compromises and unambiguous concessions on both sides, albeit mostly on ours. The significant progress reached throughout this process confirms the constructiveness and commitment of the Republic of Serbia to this dialogue. We have also demonstrated our readiness to make compromises that were not easy, thereby helping to find mutually acceptable solutions to many complex issues. I want to emphasize that in the past four years, after we started the dialogue process in Brussels, although there have been some fights, quarrels and physical attacks against the Serbs in the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, nobody has been killed in ethnic confrontations. For Serbs and for Albanians, this is a great step forward, and I am therefore eager to continue with such political efforts in the future. Nevertheless, upon entering this Hall, we received information that Pristinaâ??s authorities had announced that they had secured the majority needed for Kosovo to gain membership status in UNESCO. I urge the Assembly not to allow this, and remind members that it was these very people who took part in the devastation of Serbian monasteries, churches and cultural and spiritual heritage sites in Kosovo and Metohija. Additionally, we have made great efforts to stabilize the overall situation in the Balkans. We have often stayed silent in the face of insults and attacks from various other countries because we know that peace and reconciliation are more important than scoring easy political points. Precisely because of that, Serbs are more than eager to continue with successful economic reforms, as well as with the idea for creating a regional economic zone, which we do not intend to give up on. The former Yugoslavia was widely respected as a market and for its success in attracting investors and international attention. Today, we are too small to succeed as individual markets. I therefore firmly believe that a unique customs zone and taxation system are the future of the region. An example of the problems we have is that a farmer producing milk only 10 kilometres from the border loses at least 7 to 8 per cent of his profit by waiting 48 hours to cross into another country. I also believe that a better, improved economy is the second biggest task for all our nations and for Serbia as well. The third issue â?? no less important than the first and second â?? is uniting the big tasks of economic progress with our aspirations to European Union (EU) membership. The path to membership in the EU, our most important trade and investment partner, is seen as leading to greater stability, economic progress and the consolidation of democracy. In previous years, the EU enlargement policy for Western Balkan countries has been one of the most powerful instruments in the political and economic transformation of the countries of the region into stable and modern societies. We believe that this policy, regardless of all the difficulties existing within the EU itself as well as in the candidate countries and potential candidates, must continue, and on an equally strong basis. We all want to be a part of the EU, but sometimes people in the Balkans and people in Serbia are treated unfairly, in contrast to those who took that route earlier. We are asking the EU not to speed up our accession process but to treat us fairly and, at least to some extent, in the same manner that it treated some of the full-fledged Member States admitted after 2003. As all are aware, Serbs are a very dignified people, and we expect all other countries of the world to respect us as we respect them and their territorial integrity and sovereignty. We have never wanted nor will we ever want something that belongs to somebody else. We ask only for equal respect for our country and its people. I am proud that Serbia protects its freedom, independence and sovereignty and is a country that observes democratic principles. We will continue along that path and never give up the politics of military neutrality, because we believe that it is the politics of peace and the future. While we strive towards joining the EU and establishing partnerships with Western countries, including by improving our relations with the United States, we continue to cherish the best possible relations with the Russian Federation and the Peopleâ??s Republic of China. Not only are we not ashamed of those good relations, we are very proud of them. But we will always be ready to observe developments in todayâ??s world by not judging superficially what is right or wrong, just or unjust. We have never threatened anybody, nor will we, but we will always dare to condemn actions such as launching a missile that forces the inhabitants of the Japanese island of Hokkaido to spend a day or a night in shelters. I would like to remind members that the courageous and wise American President Dwight D. Eisenhower was prudent enough to say that â??every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothedâ??. Likewise, we will always show care for and solidarity with Syrian, Afghan, sub-Saharan or any other refugees, without diminishing our resolve to confront international terrorism and radical Islamic movements such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham or Al-Qaida, because we believe that a democratic society based on equal rights for all is the only society that we want to live and see our future in. We recognize that fighting poverty and social inequality in the context of preventing radicalism and strengthening extremism is a very important task. We champion the integration of citizens of all religions and political and other affiliations into modern society on a basis of common values, while preserving each personâ??s individual identity and respect for all. Serbia believes in and is pleased with the increasingly important role of the United Nations, not only in maintaining peace and stability, but in the more important tasks the Organization performs for the benefit of humankind today. Serbia will support any United Nations reform that strengthens the role of the Organization, because it means more discussion, less use of force and less arrogance in international relations. Our job is therefore to do everything we can to enable a more active role for the United Nations worldwide. I will conclude with words that are often attributed to the great Albert Einstein: â??The world is a dangerous place to live. Not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who do not do anything about it.â??",1,196
7894,Session 72 - 2017,ZAF_72_2017.txt,ZAF_72_2017,72,2017,ZAF,"I take this opportunity to express South Africaâ??s solidarity with the fraternal Governments and the peoples of the Caribbean following waves of devastating hurricanes that have resulted in loss of life, injuries and serious damage to infrastructure and property. Our thoughts are also with the Government and the people of Mexico in the wake of the earthquake that rocked Mexico City yesterday. I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I assure you of South Africaâ??s full support in the implementation of your priorities and responsibilities throughout your term. We also commend Mr. Peter Thompson of Fiji for his exceptional leadership during the Assemblyâ??s seventy- first session. I warmly congratulate Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres on his appointment as the Secretary- General. We also congratulateMr. Ban Ki-moon on his successsful tenure. We have chosen an appropriate theme for this debate, given the challenges facing the world today â?? â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??. The theme encompasses the three pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, humanitarian affairs and human rights, and socioeconomic and sustainable development. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), two years ago, in order to continue the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals marked a significant shift and historic moment in the life of the United Nations. We all committed ourselves to addressing the challenges of poverty, underdevelopment and inequality. However, a lot more still needs to be done to promote a more equal and just socioeconomic world order so that we can achieve the SDGs. The current structure of the global economy continues to deepen the divide between the Global North and Global South.While a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the peoples of the world still live in abject poverty and hunger, with no hope of ever improving their living conditions. Even within developed countries, the gap between rich and poor remains wide and is of serious concern. We need political will and commitment from global leaders to address the challenges and obstacles posed by the untransformed structure of the global economy, if we hope to achieve the goals and ambitions of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Those unequal and unjust economic power relations manifest themselves sharply in Africa. For example, our continent is endowed with mineral resources, but it still has the highest number of least developed countries. Many developed countries continue to fuel their development from the resources of the African continent. The continent also continues to lose a significant portion of its resources through illicit financial outflows. Africa loses billions of dollars that it otherwise would utilize to develop the continent and to provide for education, health care, housing and other critical basic needs for the African populations. Money laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance, corruption and transfer pricing by multinational companies are some of the biggest challenges to economic growth and stability. They undermine the integrity of the global financial system, efficient tax collection and equitable allocation of resources. We appeal for the cooperation and commitment of every State Member of the United Nations and the international community at large to address that phenomenon. Developed countries in particular have a historical and moral obligation to contribute to achieving a fair global economic environment and to eradicate the scourge of illicit financial flows from the continent. The United Nations should also play a central role in addressing this problem. We therefore welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 71/213, entitled â??Promotion on international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows in order to foster sustainable developmentâ??. It is a preliminary step towards a global architecture to tackle the scourge and impacts of illicit financial flows. The issue of global peace and security continues to be one of the pillars of the United Nations agenda. South Africa reaffirms its commitment to cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, particularly the African Union (AU), in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. We welcome the continued support for the AUâ??s efforts to resolve conflicts on the African continent through promoting African solutions to African problems and challenges. As Africans, we are doing everything possible to reach our goal of silencing the guns by 2020, as set out in our Agenda 2063, a continental blueprint for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Africa. In that regard, we continue to make significant progress in resolving challenges to peace and security in our continent. We hope that soon the sister people of Libya will be able to live in peace and harmony in a united and democratic country. In 2011, the African Union called for dialogue to resolve the crisis in Libya. Unfortunately, some of us present here opted for guns and bombs, and today those countries are making little effort to promote stability in Libya. The major focus and preoccupation has become how to deal with the flow of migrants arriving in Europe from our continent and the Middle East, which is a mere symptom. The war in Libya has contributed a great deal to the destabilization of the Sahel region all the way to Central Africa, creating a corridor for illicit arms trafficking and terrorist activities. In fact, had our warning been heeded that the supply of arms to civilians in Libya and the arming of civilians in Syria would cause loss of life, great instability and mayhem, the world would be more peaceful today. South Africa continues to call for an immediate end to the violence and for a Syrian-led political transition and a negotiated settlement that reflects the will of the Syrian people. In both instances â?? of Libya and Syria â?? we strongly cautioned against seeking to resolve internal challenges of sovereign States by imposing foreign solutions through military means. It is hoped that lessons will be learned from those tragic episodes in order to make the world a more peaceful place. We continue our call for calm on the Korean peninsula. The situation cannot be allowed to get out of hand. As a country that voluntarily dismantled its nuclear-weapon programme, South Africa is of the firm view that there are no safe hands for weapons of mass destruction. The only viable solution to the problems of nuclear weapons is their total elimination, as expressed in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, recently adopted by the United Nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination. It can no longer be acceptable that a few countries maintain arsenals and stockpiles of nuclear weapons as part of their strategic defence and security doctrine, while expecting others to remain at their mercy. We are concerned that any possible accidental detonation would lead to a disaster of epic proportions. We are making a clarion call to all States Members of the United Nations to sign and ratify the nuclear- weapon-ban treaty in order to rid the world and humankind of these lethal weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, we reaffirm the inalienable right of States to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as reinforced in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. South Africa is today proud to be the biggest producer of medical isotopes used in the treatment of cancer patients globally. We will continue to harness the peaceful uses of atoms in addressing challenges of socioeconomic development. As we stand here, the Security Council is paralysed and unable to carry out its Charter responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security. We remain steadfast in our call for the reform of that critical organ of the United Nations. We hope that the Secretary-General, working with the entire membership, can provide some impetus towards fulfilling this long- awaited ideal. Failure to do so will result in the United Nations irreversibly losing its legitimacy. We take this opportunity to express our empathy and solidarity with all the victims of the devastating hurricanes, monsoons, floods and droughts as a result of climate change. Those phenomena are proof that climate change is real and that, if we do not act now, future generations will suffer untold consequences. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a milestone in the history of efforts to address climate change and all its consequences. We should resist all efforts to unravel and undermine the Paris Agreement. Our efforts should be directed at the mobilization of the resources required for its implementation. For South Africa, the seventy-second session of the General Assembly coincides with the centenary of Oliver Reginald Tambo, who led our liberation movement, the African National Congress, for three decades in the struggle against apartheid and racism in South Africa. O.R. Tambo travelled all over the continent of Africa and the globe, mobilizing international support for the struggle against racial discrimination and the oppressive apartheid regime. He strongly believed in the role of multilateralism and in the centrality of the United Nations. It was for that reason that he spent a lot of time in the rooms and corridors of this United Nations building, mobilizing members to take firm action against the apartheid regime in South Africa. As we celebrate what would have been O.R. Tamboâ??s one-hundredth birthday, we take this opportunity as a country once again to thank the United Nations and the international community for their support for and solidarity with our struggle for liberation. If O.R. Tambo were still alive today, he would have pleaded with the Organization to do all it can to support the struggle of the Palestinian people against occupation and to support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara. The world has preached a two-State solution for the situation in Palestine, yet we have seen the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. We appeal to the General Assembly that the same resolve shown in supporting the South African struggle for liberation should be shown towards ending the apartheid practices against the people of Palestine. We also wish to remind the General Assembly that the right of the people of Western Sahara to self- determination continues to be undermined, challenged and denied. The United Nations must remain seized with that issue, for the benefit of the people of Western Sahara and the African aspirations for integration and peaceful coexistence. I also wish to register South Africaâ??s disappointment at the decision of the United States Administration in June to reverse the progress that was made in the past two years towards ending the Cuban blockade. South Africa stands ready to work with the United Nations to promote peace, human rights and sustainable development. As said by our liberation icon Oliver Reginald Tambo, â??We seek to live in peace with our neighbours and the peoples of the world in conditions of equality, mutual respect and equal advantage.â??",1,196
7895,Session 72 - 2017,ZMB_72_2017.txt,ZMB_72_2017,72,2017,ZMB,"Let me join previous speakers in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also wish to extend Zambiaâ??s sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his able leadership during the seventy-first session. May I also convey my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. AntÃ³nio Guterres and congratulate him on his appointment as the ninth Secretary- General. I am confident that the Secretary-General will build upon the strong foundation that was laid by his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to whom I wish to pay glowing tribute for the manner in which he steered the Organization during his tenure of office. The theme for this session, â??Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planetâ??, provides us with an opportunity to evaluate the existing multilateral approaches to address the challenges affecting our peoples. They include threats to socioeconomic development and international peace and security. There is a need, therefore, to develop innovative approaches and responses to the challenges, which include terrorism, climate change, nuclear weapons and HIV/AIDS, among many others. In todayâ??s globalized and interdependent world, no country, however wealthy or powerful, can resolve all those challenges single-handedly. Common solutions are therefore required through a strong United Nations. This yearâ??s session is taking place against a backdrop of the adverse effects of climate change, which have spared no one nation, developed or underdeveloped. Our efforts to raise the standard of living for the worldâ??s poor people in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals are being frustrated by the effects of climate change. We have witnessed the devastating effects of climate change on our environment. Recently, there have been many hurricanes in the Caribbean. I remember a time when forests were within a childâ??s walking distance, in particular in Africa, and were teeming with a profusion of flora and fauna. That is no longer the case. Unfortunately, a myriad of species of flora and fauna have become extinct in a very short time. We have also continued to witness disasters such as droughts, wildfires, flooding and landslides; if not extreme levels of rain, it is the lack of it. As the twenty-third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change draws near, Zambia is expectant that the Conference will, among other things, establish mechanisms for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Furthermore, we call on all stakeholders to ensure that the Green Climate Fund is adequately funded in order to help deliver the necessary interventions globally. As a developing country, Zambia needs assistance to enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas, such as scientific research, early warning and rapid response in order to address the adverse effects of climate change. Accordingly, Zambia also calls for the transfer of appropriate technologies to help cope with the negative impact of climate change. Over the past year, Zambia has made significant developmental efforts and is determined to foster an all-inclusive development paradigm, based on the African Unionâ??s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Only a few months ago, on 21 June, I had the honour to launch the seventh National Development Plan, which is Zambiaâ??s development blueprint for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021. Its theme is â??Accelerating development efforts towards the attainment of the National Vision 2030, without leaving anyone behindâ??. The plan seeks to improve productivity in agriculture, create job opportunities in other sectors, such as manufacturing, and particular attention will be given to lifting standards of living in rural areas, where a new focus on agro-value addition is being implemented. Through that plan, Zambia aims to reduce poverty to minimal levels. In keeping with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, my Government is determined to ensure the effective mobilization and use of all sources of finance, whether mobilized locally or through our international cooperation partners, for the benefit of the average person in Zambia â?? as long as it is not illicit financing. Peace, security and the rule of law continue to be the basis for the meaningful development of any society. In keeping with that understanding, my Government has continued to work in solidarity with nations that are undertaking the necessary actions to enhance their democracies. Through its membership in the African Union Peace and Security Council, Zambia has also continued to provide support for those still afflicted by conflict. My Government also looks forward to serving the Troika of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation of the Southern African Development Community from 2017 to 2020, following our recent election to the Organ. I would like to assure the Assembly that my Government will use its membership in these two bodies to foster peace globally, especially in Africa. We wish to recognize the vision and experience of the various regional and international bodies that complement the United Nations agenda. As a member State, we note the role of the Commonwealth of Nations in various subjects such as gender and youth matters, climate change, the promotion of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, good governance and socioeconomic development. In my country, the Commonwealth Secretariat has played an important role in providing technical support during and after the previously held elections, and this we cannot ignore. Zambia has also continued to serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations with a sense of duty to those persons who have found their security under threat for various reasons. In this regard, the United Nations should not shirk its noble duty to these vulnerable persons; it should redouble its efforts to bring about a more peaceful world. The United Nations commitment should not be limited to preventing conflict, but should go further in seeking to protect victims of conflict, including displaced persons. There is a need for all of us to cooperate in providing for a environment conducive to respect for their human rights, social development and well-being. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that in June this year, in Zambia, I assented to Zambiaâ??s Refugees Act of 2017, which further speaks to this noble duty and replaces the previous law, which did not go far enough to ensure an environment conducive to the promotion of human rights for the displaced in the region who happen to be hosted by our country, Zambia. My Government attaches great importance to the needs and welfare of all, with a particular focus on women, children and youth. Zambia has therefore continued to make tremendous strides in its campaign to end child marriage. The current prevalence rate stands at 31.2 per cent, which represents a 10.8 per cent reduction from the 42 per cent rate at the time the campaign was launched. We have also continued to engage traditional leaders in reforming traditions and customs that allow child marriage. Currently, we are in the process of harmonizing statutory and customary law on marriage to completely prohibit and eradicate child marriage in the country. Going forward, we are also repealing a number of discriminatory and outdated statutes related to children with a view to devising a Childrenâ??s Code to incorporate the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into our domestic law. As the designated 2017 African Union champion for ending child marriage, I am delighted to inform the Assembly that a campaign to that end has been launched in 20 of the 30 targeted countries in Africa with the highest prevalence rates of child marriage. These programmes are essential to enhancing advocacy against child marriage at the national level. The campaign is growing from strength to strength. However, much more needs to be done. We therefore call on all partners to join their efforts, and, together, let us raise our voices to protect our children and young people. The campaign will continue to gain momentum and reach out to member States to accelerate an end to this harmful practice. Undoubtedly, the United Nations remains the only multilateral institution capable of addressing the challenges of our â??one worldâ??. The world looks to the Organization to encourage dialogue on global challenges in an inclusive manner. This is the only practical way to ensure meaningful and effective international cooperation. There is, however, a need to reform the United Nations. Zambia believes that the United Nations reforms that have been launched will be incomplete without meaningful reform of the Security Council. It is our hope that reforms will make the Security Council more representative, democratic and accountable to all States Members of the United Nations, irrespective of status. This is essential if its decisions are to be accepted by the entire international community. Given that Africa constitutes the second largest bloc of United Nations membership, proposals to reform the Security Council should heed the African continentâ??s call set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus. In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Zambiaâ??s commitment to cooperate with the international community in addressing the numerous problems affecting our people, including ending poverty. We should not miss the opportunity to do what we can to make the world a better place for all of us to live.",1,196
7896,Session 72 - 2017,ZWE_72_2017.txt,ZWE_72_2017,72,2017,ZWE,"I wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav LajÄ?Ã¡k on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Thomson, for his commitment to and efforts in accelerating the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The President could not have chosen a better or more relevant theme for this session, given the times that we are living in, for the pursuit and maintenance of peace and the promotion of development, in solidarity, lie at the core of the mission of the United Nations and its entire system. Since the signing of the Charter of the United Nations 72 years ago, and in subsequent conventions, resolutions and declarations adopted over the decades, Member States have sought to actualize the unquenchable human hope for peace, justice and progress. However, the current global development agenda differs in significant ways from all of those that preceded it. It is ambitious, revolutionary, transformative and universal, and it encompasses every single facet of human life. For its success, the agenda demands a radical, unprecedented paradigm shift in every sphere of human life. We cannot halt or reverse the continued destruction of our natural habitat or the rise in global atmospheric temperature without a change in contemporary production and consumption patterns. That has been confirmed by scientific evidence. We cannot halt or reverse the persistent, widening gap between the rich and the poor among our nations without deeper international cooperation and a genuine reform of the existing inequitable international system. The current system is inherently structured to enrich a few and impoverish the many. Therefore, it cannot deliver on a key aspiration, watchword and objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development â?? that of leaving no one behind. For us in Africa, the current antiquated system perpetuates a historic injustice â?? one that can never be justified today. The 2030 Agenda represents new wine, and we call for a new wineskin, lest we ruin the new wine. It is for that reason that I reiterate my countryâ??s unflinching support for the African Common Position on Security Council reform, commonly known as the Ezulwini Consensus. The overwhelming majority of us have accepted that we need to reform the current system in order to improve, but not destroy it. Nonetheless, the negotiations and process intended to yield the accepted reforms are painstakingly slow. We are left to wonder, justifiably so, whether those who enjoy and sometimes abuse the power and privileges of the current set-up are sincere interlocutors in those discussions. It is axiomatic that we harvest what we sow, yet by some strange logic we expect to reap peace when we invest and expend so much, in treasure and technology, in war. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military expenditure in 2016 amounted to approximately $1.6 trillion. In the same year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, overseas development assistance amounted to approximately $142.6 billion. Those mega investments in ever more lethal weapons and more sophisticated war machinery have not resulted in greater peace or security. Instead, we have witnessed heart-rending suffering and misery and increased mass movements of people fleeing wars and armed conflicts. That trend should be halted for the benefit of humankind. We believe that a different and better world is possible. In proposing and inviting us to focus on prevention, preventive diplomacy, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, peacebuilding and sustaining peace, the Secretary-General is pointing us in that desirable direction. We must also seriously tackle the multifaceted and complex root causes of conflict, including enduring poverty and deprivation, unequal access to resources, the denial of the right to self- determination of peoples, and interference in the internal affairs of other States, among other causes. The continued denial of the right to self- determination to the peoples of Western Sahara and Palestine, who are living under colonial and foreign occupation, is immoral and an urgent issue for those seeking peace and security in our time. The Security Council has assumed its responsibilities, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, and adopted numerous resolutions. What remains is the enforcement and implementation of those resolutions. We call on the Security Council to demonstrate its authority by ensuring the holding, without much further delay, of the independence referendum in Western Sahara. We expect the Security Council to work closely with the African Union â?? its proven partner for peace on the African continent â?? in that effort. The ever- deteriorating situation and continued suffering of the Palestinian people should spur the Security Council to renewed, time-framed efforts to bring about the two- State solution already defined in numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Development and peace are conjoined and cannot be separated. My country has embraced the 2030 Agenda as an integrated and comprehensive approach to address the myriad and complex national and global challenges, in solidarity and in cooperation with other stakeholders. Zimbabwe was honoured to be among some other 40-plus countries that participated in the voluntary national review at the 2017 high-level political forum in July. We were and still are pleased to share with other countries our experiences and to learn from others about their experiences in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize the need for beneficial partnerships, both within and outside our national borders. One of our key partners is the United Nations system, with which, I am happy to note, we work very closely. I wish in that regard to welcome the Secretary-Generalâ??s initiative to ensure that the support of United Nations country teams will be guided by national priorities. That will ensure national ownership and leadership of development processes, as well as the sustainability of development projects and programmes. That is what we are experiencing in Zimbabwe. My country is an unflinching advocate of respect for the sovereignty and independence of countries. We therefore strongly defend and respect the right of each country to take decisions in exercising its sovereign rights. We cannot, however, remain silent when those decisions impact or have the potential to negatively affect our own welfare. And to that end, may I say that some of us were embarrassed, if not frightened by what appeared to be the return of the biblical giant Goliath. Are we experiencing the return of a Goliath in our midst that threatens the extinction of all countries? May I say to the United States President, Mr. Trump, that he please blow his trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness and dialogue, for which we have always stood and that are enshrined in our very sacred document, the Charter of the United Nations. Upon those values each nation, including the United States, can build its greatness. And it is the greatness in recognizing those values of unity, peace, cooperation, dialogue and togetherness that we would want to be guided by the United States, and not by the promise of our damnation. We shall always resist damnation, no matter whence it comes. We resisted it when it was in the form of imperialism as we fought for our own independence, our own culture and our own sovereignty, and to be masters of our own destiny. That is why we call ourselves free today. It is because the monster of imperialism was defeated by us. Bring us another monster, by whatever name, and it will suffer the same consequences. Climate change is a present reality and so are its effects and impacts. Climate change is global. We cannot remain silent when a major world economic Power, or any other State for that matter, decides to abandon the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as Mr. Trumpâ??s great United States has done. Let us work together. Climate change is a reality. It is vital that we all play our part, in keeping with the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in order to halt the inexorable march towards the destruction of that on which our own existence depends. On behalf of my country, I want to express our condolences to Puerto Rico and to countries that have suffered afflictions. There are many in this part of the world. We say that we are very sorry and we appeal to the rest of us, who have not suffered similar afflictions, to assist those who have suffered in such a horrific manner. I ask anyone here to watch television today and tell me whether they know where Puerto Rico is geographically. It has been completely wiped out by a hurricane. We are very sorry. As I conclude my remarks, it is worth reminding one another that the world today, by its very interconnectedness, demands more, not less, solidarity; more, not less, cooperation and dialogue; more, not less, multilateralism. We have brought more and more issues under the global agenda and within global discourse. That acknowledgement has found expression in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the Sustainable Development Goals. Our survival and progress calls for reinforced solidarity, partnerships and cooperation and for development in unity, cooperation and peace. That is a call to which we must all respond positively and actively. Zimbabwe is already doing so.",1,196
